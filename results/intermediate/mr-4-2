the 1
people 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
couldnt 1
ever 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
quick 1
as 1
a 1
wink 1
with 1
the 1
funniest 1
things 1
a 1
body 1
ever 1
said 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
ever 1
_could_ 1
think 1
of 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
so 1
pat 1
was 1
what 1
i 1
couldnt 1
noway 1
understand 1
why 1
i 1
couldnt 1
a 1
thought 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
drunk 1
man 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
ringsaid 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
ride 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
ride 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
anybody 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
they 1
argued 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
him 1
out 1
but 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
listen 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
show 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
standstill 1
then 1
the 1
people 1
begun 1
to 1
holler 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
make 1
fun 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
and 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
so 1
that 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
men 1
begun 1
to 1
pile 1
down 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
benches 1
and 1
swarm 1
towards 1
the 1
ring 1
saying 1
knock 1
him 1
down 1
throw 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
women 1
begun 1
to 1
scream 1
so 1
then 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
speech 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
there 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
no 1
disturbance 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
would 1
promise 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
ride 1
if 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
so 1
everybody 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
got 1
on 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
begun 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
and 1
jump 1
and 1
cavort 1
around 1
with 1
two 1
circus 1
men 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
bridle 1
trying 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
drunk 1
man 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
his 1
heels 1
flying 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
every 1
jump 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
of 1
people 1
standing 1
up 1
shouting 1
and 1
laughing 1
till 1
tears 1
rolled 1
down 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
sure 1
enough 1
all 1
the 1
circus 1
men 1
could 1
do 1
the 1
horse 1
broke 1
loose 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
like 1
the 1
very 1
nation 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
ring 1
with 1
that 1
sot 1
laying 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
hanging 1
to 1
his 1
neck 1
with 1
first 1
one 1
leg 1
hanging 1
most 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
then 1
tother 1
one 1
on 1
tother 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
just 1
crazy 1
it 1
warnt 1
funny 1
to 1
me 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
tremble 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
danger 1
but 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
struggled 1
up 1
astraddle 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
bridle 1
areeling 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
minute 1
he 1
sprung 1
up 1
and 1
dropped 1
the 1
bridle 1
and 1
stood 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
agoing 1
like 1
a 1
house 1
afire 1
too 1
he 1
just 1
stood 1
up 1
there 1
asailing 1
around 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
warnt 1
ever 1
drunk 1
in 1
his 1
lifeand 1
then 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
pull 1
off 1
his 1
clothes 1
and 1
sling 1
them 1
he 1
shed 1
them 1
so 1
thick 1
they 1
kind 1
of 1
clogged 1
up 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
altogether 1
he 1
shed 1
seventeen 1
suits 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
slim 1
and 1
handsome 1
and 1
dressed 1
the 1
gaudiest 1
and 1
prettiest 1
you 1
ever 1
saw 1
and 1
he 1
lit 1
into 1
that 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
fairly 1
humand 1
finally 1
skipped 1
off 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
danced 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
dressingroom 1
and 1
everybody 1
just 1
ahowling 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
astonishment 1
then 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
he 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
fooled 1
and 1
he 1
_was_ 1
the 1
sickest 1
ringmaster 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
i 1
reckon 1
why 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
men 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
up 1
that 1
joke 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
head 1
and 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
nobody 1
well 1
i 1
felt 1
sheepish 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
took 1
in 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
a 1
been 1
in 1
that 1
ringmasters 1
place 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
bullier 1
circuses 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
struck 1
them 1
yet 1
anyways 1
it 1
was 1
plenty 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
_me_ 1
and 1
wherever 1
i 1
run 1
across 1
it 1
it 1
can 1
have 1
all 1
of 1
_my_ 1
custom 1
every 1
time 1
well 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
had 1
_our_ 1
show 1
but 1
there 1
warnt 1
only 1
about 1
twelve 1
people 1
therejust 1
enough 1
to 1
pay 1
expenses 1
and 1
they 1
laughed 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
duke 1
mad 1
and 1
everybody 1
left 1
anyway 1
before 1
the 1
show 1
was 1
over 1
but 1
one 1
boy 1
which 1
was 1
asleep 1
so 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
these 1
arkansaw 1
lunkheads 1
couldnt 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
shakespeare 1
what 1
they 1
wanted 1
was 1
low 1
comedyand 1
maybe 1
something 1
ruther 1
worse 1
than 1
low 1
comedy 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
size 1
their 1
style 1
so 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
got 1
some 1
big 1
sheets 1
of 1
wrapping 1
paper 1
and 1
some 1
black 1
paint 1
and 1
drawed 1
off 1
some 1
handbills 1
and 1
stuck 1
them 1
up 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
bills 1
said 1
chapter 1
xxiii 1
well 1
all 1
day 1
him 1
and 1
the 1

hard 1
at 1
it 1
rigging 1

stage 1
and 1
a 1
curtain 1
and 1
a 1
row 1
of 1
candles 1
for 1
footlights 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
jam 1
full 1
of 1
men 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
when 1
the 1
place 1
couldnt 1
hold 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
quit 1
tending 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
around 1
the 1
back 1
way 1
and 1
come 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
stood 1
up 1
before 1
the 1
curtain 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
speech 1
and 1
praised 1
up 1
this 1
tragedy 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
thrillingest 1
one 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
abragging 1
about 1
the 1

and 1
about 1
edmund 1

the 1

in 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1

everybodys 1
expectations 1
up 1
high 1

never 1
mind 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1

and 1
when 1
the 1

but 1
weve 1
got 1
them 1
on 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
remember 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
make 1
allowances 1
sometimes 1
i 1
wish 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
thats 1
out 1
of 1
kings 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
to 1
tell 1
jim 1
these 1
warnt 1
real 1
kings 1
and 1
dukes 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
a 1
done 1
no 1
good 1
and 1
besides 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
you 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
real 1
kind 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
jim 1
didnt 1
call 1
me 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
turn 1
he 1
often 1
done 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
waked 1
up 1
just 1
at 1
daybreak 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
betwixt 1
his 1
knees 1
moaning 1
and 1
mourning 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
didnt 1
take 1
notice 1
nor 1
let 1
on 1
i 1
knowed 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
about 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
his 1
children 1
away 1
up 1
yonder 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
low 1
and 1
homesick 1
because 1
he 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
been 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
before 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
believe 1
he 1
cared 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
his 1
people 1
as 1
white 1
folks 1
does 1
for 1
theirn 1
it 1
dont 1
seem 1
natural 1
but 1
i 1
reckon 1
its 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
often 1
moaning 1
and 1
mourning 1
that 1
way 1
nights 1
when 1
he 1
judged 1
i 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1

no 1
mo 1

nigger 1
jim 1

chapter 1
xxiv 1
next 1
day 1
towards 1
night 1
we 1
laid 1
up 1
under 1
a 1
little 1
willow 1
towhead 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
village 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
begun 1
to 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
for 1
working 1
them 1
towns 1
jim 1
he 1
spoke 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
take 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
because 1
it 1
got 1
mighty 1
heavy 1
and 1
tiresome 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
lay 1
all 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
tied 1
with 1
the 1
rope 1
you 1
see 1
when 1
we 1
left 1
him 1
all 1
alone 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
tie 1
him 1
because 1
if 1
anybody 1
happened 1
on 1
to 1
him 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
not 1
tied 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
look 1
much 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
you 1
know 1
so 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
it 1
_was_ 1
kind 1
of 1
hard 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
lay 1
roped 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
hed 1
cipher 1
out 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
around 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
uncommon 1
bright 1
the 1
duke 1
was 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
struck 1
it 1
he 1
dressed 1
jim 1
up 1
in 1
king 1
lears 1
outfitit 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
curtaincalico 1
gown 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
horsehair 1
wig 1
and 1
whiskers 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
theater 1
paint 1
and 1
painted 1
jims 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
and 1
ears 1
and 1
neck 1
all 1
over 1
a 1
dead 1
dull 1
solid 1
blue 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
thats 1
been 1
drownded 1
nine 1
days 1
blamed 1
if 1
he 1
warnt 1
the 1
horriblest 1
looking 1
outrage 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
then 1
the 1
duke 1
took 1
and 1
wrote 1
out 1
a 1
sign 1
on 1
a 1
shingle 1
so 1
sick 1
arabbut 1
harmless 1
when 1
not 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
he 1
nailed 1
that 1
shingle 1
to 1
a 1
lath 1
and 1
stood 1
the 1
lath 1
up 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
foot 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
jim 1
was 1
satisfied 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sight 1
better 1
than 1
lying 1
tied 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
every 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sound 1
the 1
duke 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
himself 1
free 1
and 1
easy 1
and 1
if 1
anybody 1
ever 1
come 1
meddling 1
around 1
he 1
must 1
hop 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
carry 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
fetch 1
a 1
howl 1
or 1
two 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
and 1
he 1
reckoned 1
they 1
would 1
light 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
which 1
was 1
sound 1
enough 1
judgment 1
but 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
average 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
howl 1
why 1
he 1
didnt 1
only 1
look 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
he 1
looked 1
considerable 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
these 1
rapscallions 1
wanted 1
to 1
try 1
the 1
nonesuch 1
again 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
money 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
they 1
judged 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
safe 1
because 1
maybe 1
the 1
news 1
might 1
a 1
worked 1
along 1
down 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
couldnt 1
hit 1
no 1
project 1
that 1
suited 1
exactly 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
hed 1
lay 1
off 1
and 1
work 1
his 1
brains 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
couldnt 1
put 1
up 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
arkansaw 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
drop 1
over 1
to 1
tother 1
village 1
without 1
any 1
plan 1
but 1
just 1
trust 1
in 1
providence 1
to 1
lead 1
him 1
the 1
profitable 1
waymeaning 1
the 1
devil 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
bought 1
store 1
clothes 1
where 1
we 1
stopped 1
last 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
king 1
put 1
hisn 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
put 1
mine 1
on 1
i 1
done 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
kings 1
duds 1
was 1
all 1
black 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
look 1
real 1
swell 1
and 1
starchy 1
i 1
never 1
knowed 1
how 1
clothes 1
could 1
change 1
a 1
body 1
before 1
why 1
before 1
he 1
looked 1
like 1
the 1
orneriest 1
old 1
rip 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
hed 1
take 1
off 1
his 1
new 1
white 1
beaver 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
do 1
a 1
smile 1
he 1
looked 1
that 1
grand 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
pious 1
that 1
youd 1
say 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ark 1
and 1
maybe 1
was 1
old 1
leviticus 1
himself 1
jim 1
cleaned 1
up 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
paddle 1
ready 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
steamboat 1
laying 1
at 1
the 1
shore 1
away 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
point 1
about 1
three 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
townbeen 1
there 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
taking 1
on 1
freight 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
seein 1
how 1
im 1
dressed 1

maybe 1
i 1
better 1

or 1
cincinnati 1
or 1
some 1

i 1
fetched 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
scooting 1
along 1
the 1
bluff 1
bank 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
pretty 1
soon 1
we 1

to 1
a 1
nice 1
innocentlooking 1
young 1

on 1
a 1

weather 1
he 1
asked 1

peter 1
and 1
george 1

the 1
only 1
ones 1
that 1
come 1
out 1
here 1
george 1
was 1
the 1
married 1
brother 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1

last 1
year 1
harvey 1

this 1

you 1

he 1

pretty 1
old 1
and 1
georges 1
gyirls 1
was 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
be 1
much 1
company 1
for 1
him 1
except 1
mary 1
jane 1
the 1
redheaded 1
one 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
kinder 1
lonesome 1
after 1
george 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
died 1
and 1
didnt 1
seem 1
to 1

he 1
left 1

it 1
where 1

hid 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
wanted 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1

so 1
georges 1
gyirls 1
would 1
be 1
all 1
rightfor 1
george 1
didnt 1
leave 1

and 1
that 1
letter 1

that 1
when 1
we 1
struck 1
the 1
boat 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
done 1
loading 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
she 1
got 1
off 1
the 1
king 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
going 1
aboard 1
so 1
i 1
lost 1
my 1
ride 1
after 1
all 1
when 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
me 1
paddle 1
up 1
another 1
mile 1
to 1
a 1
lonesome 1
place 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
ashore 1
and 1
says 1
now 1
hustle 1
back 1
right 1
off 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
duke 1
up 1
here 1
and 1
the 1
new 1
carpetbags 1
and 1
if 1
hes 1
gone 1
over 1
to 1
tother 1
side 1
go 1
over 1
there 1
and 1
git 1
him 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
git 1
himself 1
up 1
regardless 1
shove 1
along 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
what 1
_he_ 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
of 1
course 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
back 1
with 1
the 1
duke 1
we 1
hid 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
young 1
fellow 1
had 1
said 1
itevery 1
last 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
adoing 1
it 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
talk 1
like 1
an 1
englishman 1
and 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
well 1
too 1
for 1
a 1
slouch 1
i 1
cant 1
imitate 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
aint 1
agoing 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
but 1
he 1
really 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
good 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
deef 1
and 1
dumb 1
bilgewater 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
for 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
played 1
a 1
deef 1
and 1
dumb 1
person 1
on 1
the 1
histronic 1
boards 1
so 1
then 1
they 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
steamboat 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
little 1
boats 1
come 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
come 1
from 1
high 1
enough 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
one 1
and 1
they 1
hailed 1
her 1
she 1
sent 1
out 1
her 1
yawl 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
aboard 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
from 1
cincinnati 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
we 1
only 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
mile 1
they 1
was 1
booming 1
mad 1
and 1
gave 1
us 1
a 1
cussing 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
land 1
us 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
cam 1
he 1
says 1
if 1
gentlemen 1
kin 1
afford 1
to 1
pay 1
a 1
dollar 1
a 1
mile 1
apiece 1
to 1
be 1
took 1
on 1
and 1
put 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
yawl 1
a 1
steamboat 1
kin 1
afford 1
to 1
carry 1
em 1
cant 1
it 1
so 1
they 1
softened 1
down 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
they 1
yawled 1
us 1
ashore 1
about 1
two 1
dozen 1
men 1
flocked 1
down 1
when 1
they 1
see 1
the 1
yawl 1
acoming 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
says 1

any 1
of 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
tell 1
me 1
wher 1
mr 1
peter 1
wilks 1
lives 1
they 1
give 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
nodded 1
their 1
heads 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
what 1
d 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
then 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
soft 1
and 1
gentle 1
im 1
sorry 1
sir 1
but 1
the 1
best 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
where 1
he 1
_did_ 1
live 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
sudden 1
as 1
winking 1
the 1
ornery 1
old 1
cretur 1
went 1
an 1
to 1
smash 1
and 1
fell 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
chin 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
cried 1
down 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
says 1

and 1
we 1
never 1
got 1
to 1
see 1
him 1

too 1
hard 1
then 1
he 1
turns 1
around 1
blubbering 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
idiotic 1
signs 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
blamed 1
if 1
he 1
didnt 1
drop 1
a 1
carpetbag 1
and 1
bust 1
out 1
acrying 1
if 1
they 1

two 1
frauds 1
that 1

around 1
and 1
sympathized 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
kind 1
things 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
carried 1
their 1
carpetbags 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
lean 1
on 1

and 1
cry 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
all 1
about 1
his 1
brothers 1
last 1
moments 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
told 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
both 1
of 1

took 1
on 1
about 1

human 1
race 1

holy 1
tears 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
thanks 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
brothers 1
heart 1
because 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
mouths 1
they 1
cant 1
words 1
being 1
too 1
weak 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
rot 1
and 1
slush 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
sickening 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
blubbers 1
out 1
a 1
pious 1
goodygoody 1
amen 1
and 1
turns 1
himself 1
loose 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
crying 1
fit 1
to 1
bust 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
somebody 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
crowd 1
struck 1
up 1
the 1
doxolojer 1
and 1
everybody 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
might 1
and 1
it 1
just 1
warmed 1
you 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
you 1
feel 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
church 1
letting 1
out 1
music 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1

see 1

freshen 1
up 1
things 1
so 1
and 1
sound 1
so 1
honest 1
and 1
bully 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
begins 1
to 1
work 1
his 1
jaw 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
how 1
him 1
and 1
his 1

be 1
glad 1
if 1

few 1
of 1
the 1

principal 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
would 1
take 1
supper 1
here 1
with 1

evening 1
and 1
help 1
set 1
up 1
with 1

suspicion 1
that 1
i 1
done 1
it 1
theyve 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
here 1
and 1
they 1

till 1
theyve 1
played 1
this 1
family 1
and 1
this 1
town 1
for 1
all 1
theyre 1

so 1
ill 1
find 1
a 1
chance 1
time 1
enough 1
ill 1
steal 1
it 1
and 1
hide 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
when 1

down 1
the 1
river 1
ill 1
write 1
a 1
letter 1
and 1
tell 1
mary 1

where 1
its 1
hid 1
but 1
i 1
better 1
hive 1
it 1
tonight 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
because 1
the 1
doctor 1
maybe 1
hasnt 1
let 1
up 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
lets 1
on 1
he 1
has 1
he 1
might 1
scare 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
yet 1
so 1
thinks 1
i 1
ill 1
go 1
and 1
search 1
them 1
rooms 1
upstairs 1
the 1
hall 1
was 1
dark 1
but 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
dukes 1
room 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
paw 1
around 1
it 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
but 1
i 1
recollected 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
much 1
like 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
let 1
anybody 1
else 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
money 1
but 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
paw 1
around 1
there 1
but 1
i 1
see 1
i 1
couldnt 1
do 1
nothing 1
without 1
a 1
candle 1
and 1
i 1
dasnt 1
light 1
one 1
of 1
course 1
so 1
i 1
judged 1
id 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
other 1
thinglay 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
eavesdrop 1
about 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
hears 1
their 1
footsteps 1
coming 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
skip 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
i 1
reached 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
wasnt 1
where 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
but 1
i 1
touched 1
the 1
curtain 1
that 1
hid 1
mary 1
janes 1
frocks 1
so 1
i 1
jumped 1
in 1
behind 1
that 1
and 1
snuggled 1
in 1
amongst 1
the 1
gowns 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
perfectly 1
still 1
they 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
the 1
duke 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
look 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
i 1
hadnt 1
found 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
i 1
wanted 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
know 1
its 1
kind 1
of 1
natural 1
to 1
hide 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
up 1
to 1
anything 1
private 1
they 1
sets 1
down 1
then 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
well 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
and 1
cut 1
it 1
middlin 1
short 1
because 1
its 1
better 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
down 1
there 1
awhoopin 1
up 1
the 1
mournin 1
than 1
up 1
here 1
givin 1
em 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
talk 1
us 1
over 1
well 1
this 1

it 1
capet 1
i 1
aint 1
easy 1
i 1
aint 1
comfortable 1

on 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
your 1
plans 1
ive 1
got 1
a 1
notion 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
a 1
sound 1
one 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
duke 1
that 1
we 1
better 1
glide 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
before 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
clip 1
it 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
what 1
weve 1
got 1
specially 1
seeing 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
so 1
easy_given_ 1
back 1

at 1
our 1

we 1
allowed 1
to 1
have 1
to 1

for 1
knocking 1

about 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1

a 1
little 1
different 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
bad 1
and 1
disappointed 1
the 1
king 1
rips 1

do 1
you 1
reckon 1
a 1
nigger 1
can 1
run 1
across 1
money 1
and 1
not 1
borrow 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
your 1
heads 1
level 1
agin 1
duke 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
comes 1
afumbling 1
under 1
the 1
curtain 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
foot 1
from 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
stuck 1
tight 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
kept 1
mighty 1
still 1
though 1
quivery 1
and 1
i 1
wondered 1
what 1
them 1
fellows 1
would 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
they 1
catched 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
what 1
id 1
better 1
do 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
catch 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
got 1
the 1
bag 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
more 1
than 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
thought 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
suspicioned 1
i 1
was 1
around 1
they 1
took 1
and 1
shoved 1
the 1
bag 1
through 1
a 1
rip 1
in 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
that 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
featherbed 1
and 1
crammed 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
amongst 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
because 1
a 1
nigger 1
only 1
makes 1
up 1
the 1
featherbed 1
and 1
dont 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
only 1
about 1
twice 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
warnt 1
in 1
no 1
danger 1
of 1
getting 1
stole 1
now 1
but 1
i 1
knowed 1
better 1
i 1
had 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
before 1
they 1
was 1
halfway 1
down 1
stairs 1
i 1
groped 1
along 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
cubby 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
there 1
till 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
do 1
better 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
better 1
hide 1
it 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
somewheres 1
because 1
if 1
they 1
missed 1
it 1
they 1
would 1
give 1
the 1
house 1
a 1
good 1
ransacking 1
i 1
knowed 1
that 1
very 1
well 1
then 1
i 1
turned 1
in 1
with 1
my 1
clothes 1
all 1
on 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
a 1
gone 1
to 1
sleep 1
if 1

a 1
wanted 1
to 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
with 1
the 1
business 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
come 1
up 1
so 1
i 1
rolled 1
off 1
my 1
pallet 1
and 1
laid 1
with 1
my 1
chin 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
ladder 1
and 1
waited 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anything 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
but 1
nothing 1
did 1
so 1
i 1
held 1
on 1
till 1

the 1
late 1
sounds 1

and 1
the 1
early 1

aint 1
the 1
thing 1

again 1
and 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
before 1
he 1
gives 1
anybody 1
another 1
chance 1
to 1
smouch 1
it 1
from 1

the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
undertaker 1
come 1
with 1
his 1
man 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
the 1
coffin 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
chairs 1

more 1
from 1
the 1
neighbors 1
till 1

the 1
parlor 1
and 1
the 1

but 1
i 1
dasnt 1
go 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
under 1
it 1
with 1
folks 1
around 1
then 1
the 1
people 1
begun 1
to 1
flock 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
beats 1
and 1
the 1
girls 1
took 1
seats 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
row 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
people 1
filed 1
around 1
slow 1
in 1
single 1
rank 1
and 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
mans 1
face 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
some 1
dropped 1
in 1
a 1
tear 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
very 1
still 1
and 1
solemn 1
only 1
the 1
girls 1
and 1
the 1
beats 1
holding 1
handkerchiefs 1
to 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
keeping 1
their 1
heads 1
bent 1
and 1
sobbing 1
a 1
little 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
other 1
sound 1
but 1
the 1
scraping 1
of 1
the 1
feet 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
blowing 1
nosesbecause 1
people 1
always 1
blows 1
them 1
more 1
at 1
a 1
funeral 1
than 1
they 1
do 1
at 1
other 1
places 1
except 1
church 1
when 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
packed 1
full 1
the 1
undertaker 1
he 1
slid 1
around 1
in 1
his 1
black 1
gloves 1
with 1
his 1
softy 1
soothering 1
ways 1
putting 1
on 1
the 1
last 1
touches 1
and 1
getting 1
people 1
and 1
things 1
all 1
shipshape 1
and 1
comfortable 1
and 1
making 1
no 1
more 1
sound 1
than 1
a 1
cat 1
he 1
never 1
spoke 1
he 1
moved 1
people 1
around 1
he 1
squeezed 1
in 1
late 1
ones 1
he 1
opened 1
up 1
passageways 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
with 1
nods 1
and 1
signs 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
over 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
softest 1
glidingest 1
stealthiest 1
man 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
more 1
smile 1
to 1
him 1
than 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
a 1
ham 1
they 1
had 1
borrowed 1
a 1
melodeuma 1
sick 1
one 1
and 1
when 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
a 1
young 1
woman 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
worked 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
skreeky 1
and 1
colicky 1
and 1
everybody 1
joined 1
in 1
and 1
sung 1
and 1
peter 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
notion 1
then 1
the 1
reverend 1
hobson 1
opened 1
up 1
slow 1
and 1
solemn 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
talk 1
and 1
straight 1
off 1
the 1
most 1
outrageous 1
row 1
busted 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
a 1
body 1
ever 1
heard 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
dog 1
but 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
most 1
powerful 1
racket 1
and 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
right 1
along 1
the 1
parson 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
stand 1
there 1
over 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
waityou 1
couldnt 1
hear 1
yourself 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
right 1
down 1
awkward 1
and 1
nobody 1
didnt 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
pretty 1
soon 1
they 1
see 1
that 1
longlegged 1
undertaker 1
make 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
preacher 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
dont 1
you 1
worryjust 1
depend 1
on 1
me 1
then 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
glide 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
just 1
his 1
shoulders 1
showing 1
over 1
the 1
peoples 1
heads 1
so 1
he 1
glided 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
powwow 1
and 1
racket 1
getting 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
outrageous 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
around 1
two 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
disappears 1
down 1
cellar 1
then 1
in 1
about 1
two 1
seconds 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
whack 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
he 1
finished 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
amazing 1
howl 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
everything 1
was 1
dead 1
still 1
and 1
the 1
parson 1
begun 1
his 1
solemn 1
talk 1
where 1
he 1
left 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
here 1
comes 1
this 1
undertakers 1
back 1
and 1
shoulders 1
gliding 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
again 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
glided 1
and 1
glided 1
around 1
three 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
shaded 1
his 1
mouth 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stretched 1
his 1
neck 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
preacher 1
over 1
the 1
peoples 1
heads 1
and 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
coarse 1
whisper 1
_he 1
had 1
a 1
rat_ 1
then 1
he 1
drooped 1
down 1
and 1
glided 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
again 1
to 1
his 1
place 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
because 1
naturally 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
little 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
dont 1
cost 1
nothing 1
and 1
its 1
just 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
makes 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
and 1
liked 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
more 1
popular 1
man 1
in 1
town 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
undertaker 1
was 1
well 1
the 1
funeral 1
sermon 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
but 1
pison 1
long 1
and 1
tiresome 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
shoved 1
in 1
and 1
got 1
off 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
usual 1
rubbage 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
through 1
and 1
the 1
undertaker 1
begun 1
to 1
sneak 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
with 1
his 1
screwdriver 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
then 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
pretty 1
keen 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
meddled 1
at 1
all 1
just 1
slid 1
the 1
lid 1
along 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
mush 1
and 1
screwed 1
it 1
down 1
tight 1
and 1
fast 1
so 1
there 1

the 1

he 1
visited 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
sweetened 1
everybody 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
himself 1
ever 1
so 1
friendly 1
and 1
he 1
give 1
out 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
his 1
congregation 1
over 1
in 1
england 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
about 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
must 1
hurry 1
and 1
settle 1
up 1
the 1
estate 1
right 1
away 1
and 1
leave 1
for 1
home 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
sorry 1
he 1

so 1
pushed 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
everybody 1
they 1
wished 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
longer 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
couldnt 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
of 1
course 1
him 1
and 1
william 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
girls 1
home 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
pleased 1
everybody 1
too 1
because 1
then 1
the 1
girls 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
fixed 1
and 1
amongst 1
their 1
own 1
relations 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
the 1
girls 1
tootickled 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
clean 1
forgot 1
they 1
ever 1
had 1
a 1
trouble 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
sell 1
out 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
ready 1
them 1
poor 1
things 1
was 1
that 1
glad 1
and 1
happy 1
it 1
made 1
my 1
heart 1
ache 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
getting 1
fooled 1
and 1
lied 1
to 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
no 1
safe 1
way 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
chip 1
in 1
and 1
change 1
the 1
general 1
tune 1
well 1
blamed 1
if 1
the 1
king 1
didnt 1
bill 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
niggers 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
property 1
for 1
auction 1
straight 1
offsale 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
funeral 1
but 1
anybody 1
could 1
buy 1
private 1
beforehand 1
if 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
so 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
funeral 1
along 1
about 1
noontime 1
the 1
girls 1
joy 1
got 1
the 1
first 1
jolt 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
nigger 1
traders 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
sold 1
them 1
the 1
niggers 1
reasonable 1
for 1
threeday 1
drafts 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
the 1
two 1
sons 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
memphis 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
orleans 1
i 1
thought 1
them 1
poor 1
girls 1
and 1
them 1
niggers 1
would 1
break 1
their 1
hearts 1
for 1
grief 1
they 1
cried 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
took 1
on 1
so 1
it 1
most 1
made 1
me 1
down 1
sick 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
the 1
girls 1
said 1
they 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
dreamed 1
of 1
seeing 1
the 1
family 1
separated 1
or 1
sold 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
cant 1
ever 1
get 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
memory 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
poor 1
miserable 1
girls 1
and 1
niggers 1
hanging 1
around 1
each 1
others 1
necks 1
and 1
crying 1
and 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
couldnt 1
a 1
stood 1
it 1
all 1
but 1
would 1
a 1
had 1
to 1
bust 1
out 1
and 1
tell 1
on 1
our 1
gang 1
if 1
i 1
hadnt 1
knowed 1
the 1
sale 1
warnt 1
no 1
account 1
and 1
the 1
niggers 1
would 1
be 1
back 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
thing 1
made 1
a 1
big 1
stir 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
too 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
come 1
out 1
flatfooted 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
scandalous 1
to 1
separate 1
the 1

and 1
the 1
children 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
injured 1
the 1

i 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
think 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
she 1
set 1
there 1
very 1
impatient 1
and 1
excited 1
and 1
handsome 1
but 1
looking 1
kind 1
of 1
happy 1
and 1
easedup 1
like 1
a 1
person 1
thats 1
had 1
a 1
tooth 1
pulled 1
out 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
studying 1
it 1
out 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
i 1
reckon 1
a 1
body 1
that 1
ups 1
and 1
tells 1
the 1
truth 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
tight 1
place 1
is 1
taking 1
considerable 1
many 1
resks 1
though 1
i 1
aint 1
had 1
no 1
experience 1
and 1
cant 1
say 1
for 1
certain 1
but 1
it 1
looks 1
so 1
to 1
me 1
anyway 1
and 1
yet 1
heres 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
im 1
blest 1
if 1
it 1
dont 1
look 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
better 1
and 1
actuly 1
_safer_ 1
than 1
a 1
lie 1
i 1
must 1
lay 1
it 1
by 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
think 1
it 1
over 1
some 1
time 1
or 1

its 1
so 1
kind 1
of 1
strange 1
and 1
unregular 1

time 1

i 1

in 1
the 1
coffin 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
there 1
when 1
you 1
was 1
crying 1
there 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
mighty 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
miss 1
mary 1
jane 1
it 1
made 1
my 1
eyes 1
water 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
remember 1
her 1
crying 1
there 1
all 1
by 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
them 1
devils 1
laying 1
there 1
right 1
under 1
her 1
own 1
roof 1
shaming 1
her 1
and 1
robbing 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
folded 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
water 1
come 1
into 1
her 1
eyes 1
too 1
and 1
she 1
shook 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
hard 1
and 1
says 1
_good_bye 1
im 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
just 1
as 1
youve 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
ever 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
i 1
shant 1
ever 1
forget 1
you 1
and 1
ill 1
think 1
of 1
you 1
a 1
many 1
and 1
a 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
ill 1
_pray_ 1
for 1
you 1
tooand 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
pray 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
reckoned 1
if 1
she 1
knowed 1
me 1
shed 1
take 1
a 1
job 1
that 1
was 1
more 1
nearer 1
her 1
size 1
but 1
i 1
bet 1
she 1
done 1
it 1
just 1
the 1
sameshe 1
was 1
just 1
that 1
kind 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
grit 1
to 1
pray 1
for 1
judus 1
if 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
notionthere 1
warnt 1
no 1
backdown 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
judge 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
but 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
she 1
had 1
more 1
sand 1
in 1
her 1
than 1
any 1
girl 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
full 1
of 1
sand 1
it 1
sounds 1
like 1
flattery 1
but 1
it 1
aint 1
no 1
flattery 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
beautyand 1
goodness 1
tooshe 1
lays 1
over 1
them 1
all 1
i 1
haint 1
ever 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
that 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
her 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
door 1
no 1
i 1
haint 1
ever 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
but 1
i 1
reckon 1
ive 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
a 1
many 1
and 1
a 1
many 1
a 1
million 1
times 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
saying 1
she 1
would 1
pray 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
ever 1
id 1
a 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
any 1
good 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
pray 1
for 1
_her_ 1

exposed 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful 1
pluribusunum 1
mumps 1

my 1
bounden 1
duty 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
the 1
three 1
months 1
it 1
takes 1
to 1
show 1

her 1
if 1
shes 1

if 1
you 1
think 1
its 1
best 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
uncle 1
harvey 1
shucks 1
and 1
stay 1
fooling 1
around 1
here 1
when 1
we 1
could 1
all 1
be 1
having 1
good 1
times 1
in 1
england 1
whilst 1
we 1
was 1
waiting 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
whether 1
mary 1
janes 1
got 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
why 1
you 1
talk 1
like 1
a 1
muggins 1
well 1
anyway 1
maybe 1
youd 1
better 1
tell 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
neighbors 1
listen 1
at 1
that 1
now 1
you 1
do 1
beat 1
all 1
for 1
natural 1
stupidness 1
cant 1
you 1
_see_ 1
that 1
_theyd_ 1
go 1
and 1
tell 1
ther 1
aint 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
not 1
tell 1
anybody 1
at 1
_all_ 1
well 1
maybe 1
youre 1
rightyes 1
i 1
judge 1
you 1
_are_ 1
right 1
but 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
tell 1
uncle 1
harvey 1
shes 1
gone 1
out 1
a 1
while 1
anyway 1
so 1
he 1
wont 1
be 1
uneasy 1
about 1
her 1
yes 1
miss 1
mary 1
jane 1
she 1
wanted 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
she 1
says 1
tell 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
uncle 1
harvey 1
and 1
william 1
my 1
love 1
and 1
a 1
kiss 1
and 1
say 1
ive 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
see 1
mrmrwhat 1
_is_ 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
that 1
rich 1
family 1
your 1
uncle 1
peter 1
used 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
much 1
ofi 1
mean 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
why 1
you 1
must 1
mean 1
the 1
apthorps 1
aint 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
bother 1
them 1
kind 1
of 1
names 1
a 1
body 1
cant 1
ever 1
seem 1
to 1
remember 1
them 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
somehow 1
yes 1
she 1
said 1
say 1
she 1
has 1
run 1
over 1
for 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
apthorps 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
auction 1
and 1
buy 1
this 1
house 1
because 1
she 1
allowed 1
her 1
uncle 1
peter 1
would 1
ruther 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
and 1
shes 1
going 1
to 1
stick 1
to 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
say 1
theyll 1
come 1

if 1
she 1
is 1
shell 1
be 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
anyway 1
she 1
said 1
dont 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
proctors 1
but 1
only 1
about 1
the 1
apthorpswhich 1
ll 1
be 1
perfectly 1
true 1
because 1
she 1
is 1
going 1
there 1
to 1
speak 1
about 1
their 1
buying 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
know 1

the 1
message 1
everything 1

all 1
right 1
now 1
the 1
girls 1

and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
would 1

but 1
i 1
cant 1
do 1
that 1
very 1
handy 1
not 1
being 1
brung 1

if 1
_these_ 1
two 1
aint 1
frauds 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
idiot 1
thats 1
all 1
i 1
think 1
its 1
our 1
duty 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
they 1
dont 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
till 1
weve 1
looked 1
into 1
this 1
thing 1
come 1
along 1
hines 1
come 1
along 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
you 1
well 1
take 1
these 1
fellows 1
to 1
the 1
tavern 1
and 1
affront 1
them 1
with 1
tother 1
couple 1
and 1
i 1
reckon 1
well 1
find 1
out 1
_something_ 1
before 1
we 1
get 1
through 1
it 1
was 1
nuts 1
for 1
the 1
crowd 1
though 1
maybe 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
kings 1
friends 1
so 1
we 1
all 1
started 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
sundown 1
the 1
doctor 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
along 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
was 1
plenty 1
kind 1
enough 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
go 1
my 1
hand 1
we 1
all 1
got 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
hotel 1
and 1
lit 1
up 1
some 1
candles 1
and 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
new 1
couple 1
first 1
the 1
doctor 1
says 1
i 1
dont 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
hard 1
on 1
these 1
two 1
men 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
theyre 1
frauds 1
and 1
they 1
may 1
have 1
complices 1
that 1
we 1
dont 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
wont 1
the 1
complices 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
that 1
bag 1
of 1
gold 1
peter 1
wilks 1
left 1
it 1
aint 1
unlikely 1
if 1
these 1
men 1
aint 1
frauds 1
they 1
wont 1
object 1
to 1
sending 1
for 1
that 1
money 1
and 1
letting 1
us 1
keep 1
it 1
till 1
they 1
prove 1
theyre 1
all 1
rightaint 1
that 1
so 1
everybody 1
agreed 1
to 1
that 1
so 1
i 1
judged 1
they 1
had 1
our 1
gang 1
in 1
a 1
pretty 1
tight 1
place 1
right 1
at 1
the 1
outstart 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
only 1
looked 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
says 1
gentlemen 1
i 1
wish 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
there 1
for 1
i 1
aint 1
got 1
no 1
disposition 1
to 1
throw 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
a 1
fair 1
open 1
outandout 1
investigation 1
o 1
this 1
misable 1
business 1
but 1
alas 1
the 1
money 1

you 1
kn 1
send 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
want 1

where 1

it 1
then 1
well 1
when 1
my 1
niece 1

me 1
to 1
keep 1
for 1
her 1
i 1
took 1
and 1
hid 1

inside 1
o 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
o 1
my 1
bed 1
not 1
wishin 1
to 1

and 1
when 1

my 1
servant 1
here 1
kn 1

you 1
bout 1

gentlemen 1
the 1

i 1
see 1
nobody 1
didnt 1
altogether 1
believe 1
him 1
one 1
man 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
niggers 1
steal 1
it 1
i 1
said 1

but 1
i 1
see 1
them 1
sneaking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
hustling 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
thought 1
nothing 1
only 1
i 1
reckoned 1
they 1
was 1
afraid 1
they 1
had 1
waked 1
up 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
before 1
he 1
made 1
trouble 1
with 1
them 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
they 1
asked 1
me 1
then 1
the 1
doctor 1
whirls 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
says 1
are 1
_you_ 1
english 1
too 1
i 1
says 1
yes 1
and 1
him 1
and 1
some 1
others 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
stuff 1
well 1
then 1
they 1
sailed 1
in 1
on 1
the 1
general 1
investigation 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
had 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
hour 1
in 1
hour 1
out 1
and 1
nobody 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
supper 1
nor 1
ever 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
itand 1
so 1
they 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
it 1
_was_ 1
the 1
worst 1
mixedup 1
thing 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
they 1
made 1
the 1
king 1
tell 1
his 1
yarn 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
tell 1
hisn 1
and 1
anybody 1
but 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
prejudiced 1
chuckleheads 1
would 1
a 1
_seen_ 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
was 1
spinning 1
truth 1
and 1
tother 1
one 1
lies 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
had 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
i 1
knowed 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
lefthanded 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
his 1
eye 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
knowed 1
enough 1
to 1
talk 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
tell 1
about 1
sheffield 1
and 1
how 1
we 1
lived 1
there 1
and 1
all 1
about 1

reckon 1
you 1
aint 1

seem 1
to 1

practice 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
pretty 1
awkward 1
i 1
didnt 1
care 1
nothing 1
for 1
the 1
compliment 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
off 1
anyway 1
the 1
doctor 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
and 1
turns 1
and 1
says 1
if 1
youd 1
been 1
in 1

at 1
first 1
levi 1
bell 1
the 1
king 1
broke 1
in 1
and 1
reached 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
says 1
why 1
is 1
this 1
my 1
poor 1
dead 1
brothers 1
old 1
friend 1
that 1
hes 1
wrote 1
so 1
often 1
about 1

lawyer 1
and 1
him 1
shook 1
hands 1
and 1
the 1
lawyer 1
smiled 1
and 1
looked 1
pleased 1
and 1
they 1
talked 1
right 1
along 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
talked 1
low 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1

right 1
along 1
straight 1
for 1
the 1
graveyard 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
at 1
our 1
heels 1
for 1
we 1
made 1
noise 1
enough 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
nine 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
by 1
our 1
house 1
i 1
wished 1
i 1
hadnt 1
sent 1
mary 1
jane 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
because 1
now 1
if 1
i 1

wink 1
shed 1
light 1
out 1
and 1
save 1
me 1
and 1
blow 1
on 1
our 1
deadbeats 1
well 1
we 1
swarmed 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
road 1
just 1
carrying 1
on 1
like 1
wildcats 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
more 1
scary 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
darking 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
beginning 1
to 1
wink 1
and 1
flitter 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
to 1
shiver 1
amongst 1
the 1
leaves 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
awful 1
trouble 1
and 1
most 1
dangersome 1
i 1
ever 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
kinder 1
stunned 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
so 1
different 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
allowed 1
for 1
stead 1
of 1
being 1
fixed 1
so 1
i 1
could 1
take 1
my 1
own 1
time 1
if 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
and 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
have 1
mary 1
jane 1
at 1
my 1
back 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
closefit 1
come 1
here 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
betwixt 1
me 1
and 1
sudden 1
death 1
but 1
just 1
them 1
tattoomarks 1
if 1
they 1
didnt 1
find 1
them 1
i 1
couldnt 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
somehow 1
i 1
couldnt 1
think 1
about 1
nothing 1
else 1
it 1
got 1
darker 1
and 1
darker 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
time 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
crowd 1
the 1
slip 1
but 1
that 1
big 1
husky 1
had 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
wristhinesand 1
a 1
body 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
try 1
to 1
give 1
goliar 1
the 1
slip 1
he 1
dragged 1
me 1
right 1
along 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
there 1
they 1
swarmed 1
into 1
the 1
graveyard 1
and 1
washed 1
over 1
it 1
like 1
an 1
overflow 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
grave 1
they 1
found 1
they 1
had 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
as 1
many 1
shovels 1
as 1
they 1
wanted 1
but 1
nobody 1
hadnt 1
thought 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
lantern 1
but 1
they 1
sailed 1
into 1
digging 1
anyway 1
by 1
the 1
flicker 1
of 1
the 1
lightning 1
and 1
sent 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
nearest 1
house 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
off 1
to 1
borrow 1
one 1
so 1
they 1
dug 1
and 1
dug 1
like 1
everything 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
awful 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
started 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
swished 1
and 1
swushed 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
come 1
brisker 1
and 1
brisker 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
boomed 1
but 1
them 1
people 1
never 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
was 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
one 1
minute 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
everything 1
and 1
every 1
face 1
in 1
that 1
big 1
crowd 1
and 1
the 1
shovelfuls 1
of 1
dirt 1
sailing 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
second 1
the 1
dark 1
wiped 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
and 1
you 1
couldnt 1
see 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
unscrew 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
then 1
such 1
another 1
crowding 1
and 1
shouldering 1
and 1
shoving 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
scrouge 1
in 1
and 1
get 1
a 1
sight 1
you 1
never 1
see 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
hines 1
he 1
hurt 1
my 1
wrist 1
dreadful 1
pulling 1
and 1
tugging 1
so 1
and 1
i 1
reckon 1
he 1
clean 1
forgot 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
and 1
panting 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
the 1
lightning 1
let 1
go 1
a 1
perfect 1
sluice 1
of 1
white 1
glare 1
and 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
living 1
jingo 1
heres 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
gold 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
hines 1
let 1
out 1
a 1
whoop 1
like 1
everybody 1
else 1
and 1
dropped 1
my 1
wrist 1
and 1
give 1
a 1
big 1
surge 1
to 1
bust 1
his 1
way 1
in 1
and 1
get 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
lit 1
out 1
and 1
shinned 1
for 1
the 1
road 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
there 1
aint 1
nobody 1
can 1
tell 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
road 1

to 1
myself 1
and 1
i 1
fairly 1
flewleastways 1
i 1
had 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
myself 1
except 1
the 1
solid 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
nowandthen 1
glares 1
and 1
the 1
buzzing 1
of 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
the 1
thrashing 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
splitting 1
of 1
the 1
thunder 1
and 1
sure 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
born 1
i 1
did 1
clip 1
it 1
along 1
when 1
i 1
struck 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
see 1
there 1
warnt 1
nobody 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
so 1
i 1
never 1
hunted 1
for 1
no 1
back 1
streets 1
but 1
humped 1
it 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
main 1
one 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
towards 1
our 1
house 1
i 1
aimed 1
my 1
eye 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
no 1
light 1
there 1
the 1
house 1
all 1
darkwhich 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
sorry 1
and 1
disappointed 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
why 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
sailing 1
by 1
_flash_ 1
comes 1
the 1
light 1
in 1
mary 1
janes 1
window 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
swelled 1
up 1
sudden 1
like 1
to 1
bust 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
second 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
wasnt 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
before 1
me 1
no 1
more 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
she 1
_was_ 1
the 1
best 1
girl 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
sand 1
the 1
minute 1
i 1
was 1
far 1
enough 1
above 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
towhead 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
look 1
sharp 1
for 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
borrow 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
lightning 1
showed 1
me 1
one 1
that 1
wasnt 1
chained 1
i 1
snatched 1
it 1
and 1
shoved 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
canoe 1
and 1
warnt 1
fastened 1
with 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
rope 1
the 1
towhead 1
was 1
a 1
rattling 1
big 1
distance 1
off 1
away 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
lose 1
no 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
struck 1
the 1
raft 1
at 1
last 1

when 1

glimpsed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
lightning 1
my 1
heart 1
shot 1
up 1
in 1
my 1

wigwam 1
and 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
bottle 1
for 1

and 1
so 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
they 1

as 1
thick 1
as 1
thieves 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
tighter 1
they 1
got 1
the 1
lovinger 1
they 1

and 1
went 1
off 1
asnoring 1
in 1
each 1
others 1
arms 1
they 1
both 1
got 1
powerful 1
mellow 1
but 1
i 1
noticed 1
the 1
king 1
didnt 1
get 1
mellow 1
enough 1
to 1
forget 1
to 1
remember 1
to 1
not 1
deny 1
about 1
hiding 1
the 1
moneybag 1
again 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
easy 1
and 1
satisfied 1
of 1
course 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
snoring 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
gabble 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
jim 1
everything 1
chapter 1
xxxi 1
we 1
dasnt 1
stop 1
again 1
at 1
any 1
town 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
days 1
kept 1
right 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
we 1
was 1
down 1
south 1
in 1
the 1
warm 1
weather 1
now 1
and 1
a 1
mighty 1
long 1
ways 1
from 1
home 1
we 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
trees 1
with 1
spanish 1
moss 1
on 1
them 1
hanging 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
limbs 1
like 1
long 1
gray 1
beards 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
it 1
growing 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
woods 1
look 1
solemn 1
and 1
dismal 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
frauds 1
reckoned 1
they 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
and 1
they 1
begun 1
to 1
work 1
the 1
villages 1
again 1
first 1
they 1
done 1
a 1
lecture 1
on 1
temperance 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
make 1
enough 1
for 1
them 1
both 1
to 1
get 1
drunk 1
on 1
then 1
in 1
another 1
village 1
they 1
started 1
a 1
dancingschool 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
know 1
no 1
more 1
how 1
to 1
dance 1
than 1
a 1
kangaroo 1
does 1
so 1
the 1
first 1
prance 1
they 1
made 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
jumped 1
in 1
and 1
pranced 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
another 1
time 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
go 1
at 1
yellocution 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
yellocute 1
long 1
till 1
the 1
audience 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
solid 1
good 1
cussing 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
skip 1
out 1
they 1
tackled 1
missionarying 1
and 1
mesmerizing 1
and 1
doctoring 1
and 1
telling 1
fortunes 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
everything 1
but 1
they 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
luck 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
got 1
just 1
about 1
dead 1
broke 1
and 1
laid 1
around 1
the 1
raft 1
as 1
she 1
floated 1
along 1
thinking 1
and 1
thinking 1
and 1
never 1
saying 1
nothing 1
by 1
the 1
half 1
a 1
day 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
dreadful 1
blue 1
and 1
desperate 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
change 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
lay 1
their 1
heads 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
talk 1
low 1
and 1
confidential 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
jim 1
and 1
me 1
got 1
uneasy 1
we 1
didnt 1
like 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
we 1
judged 1
they 1
was 1
studying 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
worse 1
deviltry 1
than 1
ever 1
we 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
made 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
break 1
into 1
somebodys 1
house 1
or 1
store 1
or 1
was 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
counterfeitmoney 1
business 1
or 1
something 1
so 1
then 1
we 1
was 1
pretty 1
scared 1
and 1
made 1
up 1
an 1
agreement 1
that 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
such 1
actions 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
ever 1
got 1
the 1
least 1
show 1
we 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
the 1
cold 1
shake 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
them 1
behind 1
well 1
early 1
one 1
morning 1
we 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
safe 1
place 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
shabby 1
village 1
named 1
pikesville 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
went 1
ashore 1
and 1
told 1
us 1
all 1
to 1
stay 1
hid 1
whilst 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
smelt 1
around 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anybody 1
had 1
got 1
any 1
wind 1
of 1
the 1
royal 1
nonesuch 1
there 1
yet 1
house 1
to 1
rob 1
you 1
_mean_ 1
says 1
i 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
through 1
robbing 1
it 1
youll 1
come 1
back 1
here 1
and 1
wonder 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
jim 1
and 1
the 1
raftand 1
youll 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
in 1
wondering 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
warnt 1
back 1
by 1
midday 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
me 1
would 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
along 1
so 1
we 1
stayed 1
where 1
we 1
was 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
fretted 1
and 1
sweated 1
around 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
mighty 1
sour 1
way 1
he 1
scolded 1
us 1
for 1
everything 1
and 1
we 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
do 1
nothing 1
right 1
he 1
found 1
fault 1
with 1
every 1
little 1
thing 1
something 1
was 1
abrewing 1
sure 1
i 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
glad 1
when 1
midday 1
come 1
and 1
no 1
king 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
a 1
change 1
anywayand 1
maybe 1
a 1
chance 1
for 1
_the_ 1
change 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
so 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
hunted 1
around 1
there 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
we 1
found 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
room 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
low 1
doggery 1
very 1
tight 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
loafers 1
bullyragging 1
him 1
for 1
sport 1
and 1
he 1
acussing 1
and 1
athreatening 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
so 1
tight 1
he 1
couldnt 1
walk 1
and 1
couldnt 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
abuse 1
him 1
for 1
an 1
old 1
fool 1
and 1
the 1
king 1

to 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
to 1
think 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
come 1
to 1
nothing 1
i 1
thought 1
till 1
i 1
wore 1
my 1
head 1
sore 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
trouble 1
after 1
all 1
this 1
long 1
journey 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
wed 1
done 1
for 1
them 1
scoundrels 1
here 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
come 1
to 1
nothing 1
everything 1
all 1
busted 1
up 1
and 1
ruined 1
because 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
serve 1
jim 1
such 1
a 1
trick 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
slave 1
again 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
amongst 1
strangers 1
too 1
for 1
forty 1
dirty 1
dollars 1
once 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
myself 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
better 1
for 1
jim 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
at 1
home 1
where 1
his 1
family 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
hed 1
_got_ 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
so 1
id 1
better 1
write 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
miss 1
watson 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
i 1
soon 1
give 1
up 1
that 1
notion 1
for 1
two 1
things 1
shed 1
be 1
mad 1
and 1
disgusted 1
at 1
his 1
rascality 1
and 1
ungratefulness 1
for 1
leaving 1
her 1
and 1
so 1
shed 1
sell 1
him 1
straight 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
again 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
didnt 1
everybody 1
naturally 1
despises 1
an 1
ungrateful 1
nigger 1
and 1
theyd 1
make 1
jim 1
feel 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
hed 1
feel 1
ornery 1
and 1
disgraced 1
and 1
then 1
think 1
of 1
_me_ 1
it 1
would 1
get 1
all 1
around 1
that 1
huck 1
finn 1
helped 1
a 1
nigger 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
freedom 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
ever 1
to 1
see 1
anybody 1
from 1
that 1
town 1
again 1
id 1
be 1
ready 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
lick 1
his 1
boots 1
for 1
shame 1
thats 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
person 1
does 1
a 1
lowdown 1
thing 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
consequences 1
of 1
it 1
thinks 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
hide 1
it 1
it 1
aint 1
no 1
disgrace 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
fix 1
exactly 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
studied 1
about 1
this 1
the 1
more 1
my 1
conscience 1
went 1
to 1
grinding 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
wicked 1
and 1
lowdown 1
and 1
ornery 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
feeling 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
it 1
hit 1
me 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
that 1
here 1
was 1
the 1
plain 1

it 1
was 1
because 1
i 1
warnt 1
square 1
it 1
was 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
playing 1
double 1
i 1
was 1
letting 1
_on_ 1
to 1
give 1
up 1

but 1
away 1
inside 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
holding 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
biggest 1
one 1
of 1
all 1
i 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
my 1

to 1
that 1
niggers 1

deep 1
down 1
in 1
me 1
i 1
knowed 1

a 1
lie 1

was 1
astonishing 1
the 1

light 1
as 1
a 1
feather 1
right 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
my 1
troubles 1

piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1

and 1
excited 1

and 1
all 1
washed 1
clean 1
of 1
sin 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
felt 1
so 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
i 1
knowed 1
i 1
could 1
pray 1
now 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
do 1
it 1
straight 1
off 1
but 1
laid 1
the 1
paper 1
down 1
and 1
set 1
there 1
thinkingthinking 1
how 1
good 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
this 1
happened 1
so 1
and 1
how 1
near 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
being 1
lost 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
hell 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
thinking 1
and 1
got 1
to 1
thinking 1
over 1
our 1
trip 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
jim 1
before 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
nighttime 1
sometimes 1
moonlight 1
sometimes 1
storms 1
and 1
we 1
afloating 1
along 1
talking 1
and 1
singing 1
and 1
laughing 1
but 1
somehow 1
i 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
strike 1
no 1
places 1
to 1
harden 1
me 1
against 1
him 1
but 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
kind 1
id 1
see 1
him 1
standing 1
my 1
watch 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
hisn 1
stead 1
of 1
calling 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
on 1
sleeping 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
how 1
glad 1
he 1
was 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
back 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
swamp 1
up 1
there 1
where 1
the 1
feud 1
was 1
and 1
suchlike 1
times 1
and 1
would 1
always 1
call 1
me 1
honey 1
and 1
pet 1
me 1
and 1
do 1
everything 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
how 1
good 1
he 1
always 1
was 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
struck 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
saved 1
him 1
by 1
telling 1
the 1
men 1
we 1
had 1
smallpox 1
aboard 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
grateful 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
friend 1
old 1
jim 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
_only_ 1
one 1
hes 1
got 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
see 1
that 1
paper 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
close 1
place 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
i 1
was 1
atrembling 1
because 1
id 1
got 1
to 1
decide 1
forever 1
betwixt 1
two 1
things 1
and 1
i 1
knowed 1
it 1
i 1
studied 1
a 1
minute 1
sort 1
of 1
holding 1
my 1
breath 1
and 1
then 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
ill 1
_go_ 1
to 1
helland 1
tore 1
it 1
up 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
thoughts 1
and 1
awful 1
words 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
said 1
and 1
i 1
let 1
them 1
stay 1
said 1
and 1
never 1
thought 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
reforming 1
i 1
shoved 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
would 1
take 1
up 1
wickedness 1
again 1
which 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
line 1
being 1
brung 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
warnt 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
starter 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
steal 1
jim 1
out 1
of 1
slavery 1
again 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
up 1
anything 1
worse 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
that 1
too 1
because 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
in 1
for 1
good 1
i 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
go 1
the 1
whole 1
hog 1
then 1
i 1
set 1
to 1
thinking 1
over 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
over 1
some 1
considerable 1
many 1
ways 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
fixed 1
up 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
suited 1
me 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
bearings 1
of 1
a 1
woody 1
island 1
that 1
was 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
fairly 1
dark 1
i 1
crept 1
out 1
with 1
my 1
raft 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
in 1
i 1
slept 1
the 1
night 1
through 1
and 1
got 1
up 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
had 1
my 1
breakfast 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
store 1
clothes 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
some 1
others 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
in 1
a 1
bundle 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
cleared 1
for 1
shore 1
i 1
landed 1
below 1
where 1
i 1
judged 1
was 1
phelpss 1
place 1
and 1
hid 1
my 1
bundle 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
then 1
filled 1
up 1
the 1
canoe 1
with 1
water 1
and 1
loaded 1
rocks 1
into 1
her 1
and 1
sunk 1
her 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
find 1
her 1
again 1
when 1
i 1
wanted 1
her 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
a 1
little 1
steam 1
sawmill 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
then 1
i 1
struck 1
up 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
mill 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
sign 1
on 1
it 1
phelpss 1
sawmill 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
farmhouses 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hundred 1
yards 1
further 1
along 1
i 1
kept 1
my 1
eyes 1
peeled 1
but 1
didnt 1
see 1
nobody 1
around 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
daylight 1
now 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
mind 1
because 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
nobody 1
just 1
yeti 1
only 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
lay 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
plan 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
turn 1
up 1
there 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
not 1
from 1
below 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
shoved 1
along 1
straight 1
for 1
town 1
well 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
man 1
i 1
see 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
was 1
sticking 1
up 1
a 1
bill 1
for 1
the 1
royal 1
nonesuchthreenight 1
performancelike 1
that 1
other 1
time 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
cheek 1
them 1
frauds 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
on 1
him 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
shirk 1
he 1
looked 1
astonished 1
and 1
says 1
hel_lo_ 1
whered 1
_you_ 1
come 1
from 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
glad 1
and 1
eager 1
wheres 1
the 1
raftgot 1
her 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
i 1
says 1
why 1
thats 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
ask 1
your 1
grace 1
then 1
he 1
didnt 1
look 1
so 1
joyful 1
and 1
says 1
what 1
was 1
your 1
idea 1
for 1
asking 1
_me_ 1
he 1
says 1
well 1
i 1
says 1
when 1
i 1

that 1
doggery 1
yesterday 1

says 1
to 1
myself 1
we 1
cant 1
get 1
him 1
home 1
for 1
hours 1
till 1

soberer 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
aloafing 1
around 1
town 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
wait 1
a 1
man 1

and 1
back 1
to 1

sheep 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
along 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
dragging 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
the 1
man 1

behind 1
him 1
to 1
shove 1

along 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
for 1
me 1
and 1

and 1

and 1
we 1
after 1
him 1
we 1
