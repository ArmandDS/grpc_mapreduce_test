has 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
im 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
cecily 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
everything 1
enter 1
cecily 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
she 1
picks 1
up 1
the 1
can 1
and 1
begins 1
to 1
water 1
the 1
flowers 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
her 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
arrangements 1
for 1
another 1
bunbury 1
ah 1
there 1
she 1
is 1
cecily 1
oh 1
i 1
merely 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
water 1
the 1
roses 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1

dogcart 1

we 1
got 1
to 1
part 1
algernon 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
its 1
a 1
very 1
painful 1
parting 1
cecily 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
painful 1
to 1
part 1
from 1
people 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
known 1
for 1
a 1
very 1
brief 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
old 1
friends 1
one 1
can 1
endure 1
with 1
equanimity 1
but 1
even 1
a 1
momentary 1
separation 1
from 1
anyone 1
to 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
introduced 1
is 1
almost 1
unbearable 1
algernon 1

dogcart 1

wildly 1
passionately 1
devotedly 1

you 1
cecily 1
you 1
silly 1
boy 1
of 1
course 1
why 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
engaged 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
months 1
algernon 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
months 1
cecily 1
yes 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
exactly 1
three 1
months 1
on 1
thursday 1
algernon 1
but 1
how 1
did 1
we 1
become 1
engaged 1
cecily 1
well 1
ever 1
since 1
dear 1
uncle 1
jack 1
first 1
confessed 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
wicked 1
and 1
bad 1
you 1
of 1
course 1
have 1
formed 1
the 1
chief 1
topic 1
of 1
conversation 1
between 1
myself 1
and 1
miss 1
prism 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
much 1
talked 1
about 1
is 1
always 1
very 1
attractive 1
one 1
feels 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
something 1
in 1
him 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
daresay 1
it 1
was 1
foolish 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
fell 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
you 1
ernest 1
algernon 1
darling 1
and 1
when 1
was 1
the 1
engagement 1
actually 1
settled 1
cecily 1
on 1
the 1
14th 1
of 1
february 1
last 1
worn 1
out 1
by 1
your 1
entire 1
ignorance 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
end 1
the 1
matter 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
struggle 1
with 1
myself 1
i 1
accepted 1
you 1
under 1
this 1
dear 1
old 1
tree 1
here 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
i 1
bought 1
this 1
little 1
ring 1
in 1
your 1
name 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
little 1
bangle 1
with 1
the 1
true 1
lovers 1
knot 1
i 1
promised 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
wear 1
algernon 1
did 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
this 1
its 1
very 1
pretty 1
isnt 1
it 1
cecily 1
yes 1
youve 1
wonderfully 1
good 1
taste 1
ernest 1
its 1
the 1
excuse 1
ive 1
always 1
given 1
for 1
your 1
leading 1
such 1
a 1
bad 1
life 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
box 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
keep 1
all 1
your 1
dear 1
letters 1
kneels 1
at 1
table 1

box 1
and 1
produces 1
letters 1
tied 1
up 1
with 1
blue 1
ribbon 1
algernon 1
my 1
letters 1
but 1
my 1
own 1
sweet 1
cecily 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
written 1
you 1
any 1
letters 1
cecily 1
you 1
need 1
hardly 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
that 1
ernest 1
i 1
remember 1
only 1
too 1
well 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
write 1
your 1
letters 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
wrote 1
always 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
sometimes 1
oftener 1
algernon 1
oh 1
do 1
let 1
me 1
read 1
them 1
cecily 1
cecily 1
oh 1
i 1
couldnt 1
possibly 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
you 1
far 1
too 1
conceited 1
replaces 1
box 1
the 1
three 1
you 1
wrote 1
me 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
engagement 1
are 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
so 1
badly 1
spelled 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
read 1
them 1
without 1
crying 1
a 1
little 1
algernon 1
but 1
was 1
our 1
engagement 1
ever 1
broken 1
off 1
cecily 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
22nd 1
of 1
last 1
march 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
entry 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
shows 1
diary 1
today 1
i 1
broke 1
off 1
my 1
engagement 1
with 1
ernest 1
i 1
feel 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
the 1
weather 1
still 1
continues 1
charming 1
algernon 1
but 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
did 1
you 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
what 1
had 1
i 1
done 1
i 1
had 1
done 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
hurt 1
indeed 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
broke 1
it 1
off 1
particularly 1
when 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
so 1
charming 1
cecily 1
it 1
would 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
really 1
serious 1
engagement 1
if 1
it 1
hadnt 1
been 1
broken 1
off 1
at 1
least 1
once 1
but 1
i 1
forgave 1
you 1
before 1
the 1
week 1
was 1
out 1
algernon 1
crossing 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
kneeling 1
what 1
a 1
perfect 1
angel 1
you 1
are 1
cecily 1
cecily 1
you 1
dear 1
romantic 1
boy 1
he 1
kisses 1
her 1
she 1
puts 1
her 1
fingers 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
i 1
hope 1
your 1
hair 1
curls 1
naturally 1
does 1
it 1
algernon 1
yes 1
darling 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
help 1
from 1
others 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
algernon 1
youll 1
never 1
break 1
off 1
our 1
engagement 1
again 1
cecily 1
cecily 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
could 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
actually 1
met 1
you 1
besides 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
your 1
name 1
algernon 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
nervously 1
cecily 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
darling 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
a 1
girlish 1
dream 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
love 1
some 1
one 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
ernest 1
algernon 1
rises 1
cecily 1
also 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
name 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
inspire 1
absolute 1
confidence 1
i 1
pity 1
any 1
poor 1
married 1
woman 1
whose 1
husband 1
is 1
not 1
called 1
ernest 1
algernon 1
but 1
my 1
dear 1
child 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
love 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
some 1
other 1
name 1
cecily 1
but 1
what 1
name 1
algernon 1
oh 1
any 1
name 1
you 1
likealgernonfor 1
instance 1
cecily 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
algernon 1
algernon 1
well 1
my 1
own 1
dear 1
sweet 1
loving 1
little 1
darling 1
i 1
really 1
cant 1
see 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
object 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
algernon 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
name 1
in 1
fact 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
name 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
chaps 1
who 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
bankruptcy 1
court 1
are 1
called 1
algernon 1
but 1
seriously 1
cecily 1
moving 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
algy 1
couldnt 1
you 1
love 1
me 1
cecily 1
rising 1
i 1
might 1
respect 1
you 1
ernest 1
i 1
might 1
admire 1
your 1
character 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
undivided 1
attention 1
algernon 1
ahem 1
cecily 1
picking 1
up 1
hat 1
your 1
rector 1
here 1
is 1
i 1
suppose 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
in 1
the 1
practice 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
rites 1
and 1
ceremonials 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
cecily 1
oh 1
yes 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
learned 1
man 1
he 1
has 1
never 1
written 1
a 1
single 1
book 1
so 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
much 1
he 1
knows 1
algernon 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
on 1
a 1
most 1
important 1
christeningi 1
mean 1
on 1
most 1
important 1
business 1
cecily 1
oh 1
algernon 1
i 1
shant 1
be 1
away 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
cecily 1
considering 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
engaged 1
since 1
february 1
the 1
14th 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
only 1
met 1
you 1
today 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
hard 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
leave 1
me 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
period 1
as 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
couldnt 1
you 1
make 1
it 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
algernon 1
ill 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
kisses 1
her 1
and 1
rushes 1
down 1
the 1
garden 1
cecily 1
what 1
an 1
impetuous 1
boy 1
he 1
is 1
i 1
like 1
his 1
hair 1
so 1
much 1
i 1
must 1
enter 1

proposal 1

already 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
my 1
first 1
impressions 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
never 1
wrong 1
cecily 1
how 1
nice 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
like 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
after 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
such 1
a 1
comparatively 1
short 1
time 1
pray 1
sit 1
down 1
gwendolen 1
still 1
standing 1
up 1
i 1
may 1
call 1
you 1
cecily 1
may 1
i 1
not 1
cecily 1
with 1
pleasure 1
gwendolen 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
call 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
wont 1
you 1
cecily 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
gwendolen 1
then 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
quite 1
settled 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
cecily 1
i 1
hope 1
so 1
a 1
pause 1
they 1
both 1
sit 1
down 1
together 1
gwendolen 1
perhaps 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
for 1
my 1
mentioning 1
who 1
i 1
am 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
lord 1
bracknell 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
papa 1
i 1
suppose 1
cecily 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
so 1
gwendolen 1
outside 1
the 1
family 1
circle 1
papa 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
entirely 1
unknown 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
home 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
proper 1
sphere 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
certainly 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
begins 1
to 1
neglect 1
his 1
domestic 1
duties 1
he 1
becomes 1
painfully 1
effeminate 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
that 1
it 1
makes 1
men 1
so 1
very 1
attractive 1
cecily 1
mamma 1
whose 1
views 1
on 1
education 1
are 1
remarkably 1
strict 1
has 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
extremely 1
shortsighted 1
it 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
her 1
system 1
so 1
do 1
you 1
mind 1
my 1
looking 1
at 1
you 1
through 1
my 1
glasses 1
cecily 1
oh 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
being 1
looked 1
at 1
gwendolen 1
after 1
examining 1
cecily 1
carefully 1
through 1
a 1
lorgnette 1
you 1
are 1
here 1
on 1
a 1
short 1
visit 1
i 1
suppose 1
cecily 1
oh 1
no 1
i 1
live 1
here 1
gwendolen 1
severely 1
really 1
your 1
mother 1
no 1
doubt 1
or 1
some 1
female 1
relative 1
of 1
advanced 1
years 1
resides 1
here 1
also 1
cecily 1
oh 1
no 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
mother 1
nor 1
in 1
fact 1
any 1
relations 1
gwendolen 1
indeed 1
cecily 1
my 1
dear 1
guardian 1
with 1
the 1
assistance 1
of 1
miss 1
prism 1
has 1
the 1
arduous 1
task 1
of 1
looking 1
after 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
your 1
guardian 1
cecily 1
yes 1
i 1
am 1
mr 1
worthings 1
ward 1
gwendolen 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
strange 1
he 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
ward 1
how 1
secretive 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
grows 1
more 1
interesting 1
hourly 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
news 1
inspires 1
me 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
unmixed 1
delight 1
rising 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
you 1
cecily 1
i 1
have 1
liked 1
you 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
mr 1
worthings 1
ward 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
expressing 1
a 1
wish 1
you 1
werewell 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
older 1
than 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
beand 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
very 1
alluring 1
in 1
appearance 1
in 1
fact 1
if 1
i 1
may 1
speak 1
candidly 1
cecily 1
pray 1
do 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
whenever 1
one 1
has 1
anything 1
unpleasant 1
to 1
say 1
one 1
should 1
always 1
be 1
quite 1
candid 1
gwendolen 1
well 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
perfect 1
candour 1
cecily 1
i 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
fully 1
fortytwo 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
plain 1
for 1
your 1
age 1
ernest 1
has 1
a 1
strong 1
upright 1
nature 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
soul 1
of 1
truth 1
and 1
honour 1
disloyalty 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
impossible 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
deception 1
but 1
even 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
noblest 1
possible 1
moral 1
character 1
are 1
extremely 1
susceptible 1
to 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
the 1
physical 1
charms 1
of 1
others 1
modern 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
ancient 1
history 1
supplies 1
us 1
with 1
many 1
most 1
painful 1
examples 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
refer 1
to 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
indeed 1
history 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
unreadable 1
cecily 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
gwendolen 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
ernest 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
cecily 1
oh 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
mr 1
ernest 1
worthing 1
who 1
is 1
my 1
guardian 1
it 1
is 1
his 1
brotherhis 1
elder 1
brother 1
gwendolen 1
sitting 1
down 1
again 1
ernest 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
say 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
good 1
terms 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
gwendolen 1
ah 1
that 1
accounts 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
heard 1
any 1
man 1
mention 1
his 1
brother 1
the 1
subject 1
seems 1
distasteful 1
to 1
most 1
men 1
cecily 1
you 1
have 1
lifted 1
a 1
load 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
growing 1
almost 1
anxious 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
terrible 1
if 1
any 1
cloud 1
had 1
come 1
across 1
a 1
friendship 1
like 1
ours 1
would 1
it 1
not 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
mr 1
ernest 1
worthing 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
guardian 1
cecily 1
quite 1
sure 1
a 1
pause 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
gwendolen 1
inquiringly 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
cecily 1
rather 1
shy 1
and 1
confidingly 1
dearest 1
gwendolen 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
make 1
a 1
secret 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
our 1
little 1
county 1
newspaper 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
chronicle 1
the 1
fact 1
next 1
week 1
mr 1
ernest 1
worthing 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
gwendolen 1
quite 1
politely 1
rising 1
my 1
darling 1
cecily 1
i 1
think 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
slight 1
error 1
mr 1
ernest 1
worthing 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
announcement 1
will 1
appear 1
in 1
the 1
_morning 1
post_ 1
on 1
saturday 1
at 1
the 1
latest 1
cecily 1
very 1
politely 1
rising 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
under 1
some 1
misconception 1
ernest 1
proposed 1
to 1
me 1
exactly 1
ten 1
minutes 1
ago 1
shows 1
diary 1
gwendolen 1
examines 1
diary 1
through 1
her 1
lorgnettte 1
carefully 1
it 1
is 1
certainly 1
very 1
curious 1
for 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
yesterday 1
afternoon 1
at 1
530 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
care 1
to 1
verify 1
the 1
incident 1
pray 1
do 1
so 1
produces 1
diary 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
i 1
never 1
travel 1
without 1
my 1
diary 1
one 1
should 1
always 1
have 1
something 1
sensational 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
the 1
train 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
dear 1
cecily 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
any 1
disappointment 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
prior 1
claim 1
cecily 1
it 1
would 1
distress 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
dear 1
gwendolen 1
if 1
it 1
caused 1
you 1
any 1
mental 1
or 1
physical 1
anguish 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
bound 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
that 1
since 1
ernest 1
proposed 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
clearly 1
has 1
changed 1
his 1
mind 1
gwendolen 1
meditatively 1
if 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
has 1
been 1
entrapped 1
into 1
any 1
foolish 1
promise 1
i 1
shall 1
consider 1
it 1
my 1
duty 1
to 1
rescue 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
firm 1
hand 1
cecily 1
thoughtfully 1
and 1
sadly 1
whatever 1
unfortunate 1
entanglement 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
may 1
have 1
got 1
into 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
reproach 1
him 1
with 1
it 1
after 1
we 1
are 1
married 1
gwendolen 1
do 1
you 1
allude 1
to 1
me 1
miss 1
cardew 1
as 1
an 1
entanglement 1
you 1
are 1
presumptuous 1
on 1
an 1
occasion 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
it 1
becomes 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
moral 1
duty 1
to 1
speak 1
ones 1
mind 1
it 1
becomes 1
a 1
pleasure 1
cecily 1
do 1
you 1
suggest 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
that 1
i 1
entrapped 1
ernest 1
into 1
an 1
engagement 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
wearing 1
the 1
shallow 1
mask 1
of 1
manners 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
spade 1
i 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
spade 1
gwendolen 1
satirically 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
spade 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
our 1
social 1
spheres 1
have 1
been 1
widely 1
different 1
enter 1
merriman 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
footman 1
he 1
carries 1
a 1
salver 1
table 1
cloth 1
and 1
plate 1
stand 1
cecily 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
retort 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
exercises 1
a 1
restraining 1
influence 1
under 1
which 1
both 1
girls 1
chafe 1
merriman 1
shall 1
i 1
lay 1
tea 1
here 1
as 1
usual 1
miss 1
cecily 1
sternly 1
in 1
a 1
calm 1
voice 1
yes 1
as 1
usual 1
merriman 1
begins 1
to 1
clear 1
table 1
and 1
lay 1
cloth 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
cecily 1
and 1
gwendolen 1
glare 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
gwendolen 1
are 1
there 1
many 1
interesting 1
walks 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
miss 1
cardew 1
cecily 1
oh 1
yes 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
quite 1
close 1
one 1
can 1
see 1
five 1
counties 1
gwendolen 1
five 1
counties 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
hate 1
crowds 1
cecily 1
sweetly 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
you 1
live 1
in 1
town 1
gwendolen 1
bites 1
her 1
lip 1
and 1
beats 1
her 1
foot 1
nervously 1
with 1
her 1
parasol 1
gwendolen 1
looking 1
round 1
quite 1
a 1
wellkept 1
garden 1
this 1
is 1
miss 1
cardew 1
cecily 1
so 1
glad 1
you 1
like 1
it 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
flowers 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
cecily 1
oh 1
flowers 1
are 1
as 1
common 1
here 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
as 1
people 1
are 1
in 1
london 1
gwendolen 1
personally 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
how 1
anybody 1
manages 1
to 1
exist 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
if 1
anybody 1
who 1
is 1
anybody 1
does 1
the 1
country 1
always 1
bores 1
me 1
to 1
death 1
cecily 1
ah 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
newspapers 1
call 1
agricultural 1
depression 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
i 1
believe 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
are 1
suffering 1
very 1
much 1
from 1
it 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
an 1
epidemic 1
amongst 1
them 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
told 1
may 1
i 1
offer 1
you 1
some 1
tea 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
gwendolen 1
with 1
elaborate 1
politeness 1
thank 1
you 1
aside 1
detestable 1
girl 1
but 1
i 1
require 1
tea 1
cecily 1
sweetly 1
sugar 1
gwendolen 1
superciliously 1
no 1
thank 1
you 1
sugar 1
is 1
not 1
fashionable 1
any 1
more 1
cecily 1
looks 1
angrily 1
at 1
her 1
takes 1
up 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
puts 1
four 1
lumps 1
of 1
sugar 1
into 1
the 1
cup 1
cecily 1
severely 1
cake 1
or 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
gwendolen 1
in 1
a 1
bored 1
manner 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
please 1
cake 1
is 1
rarely 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
best 1
houses 1
nowadays 1
cecily 1
cuts 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
slice 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
puts 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
tray 1
hand 1
that 1
to 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
merriman 1
does 1
so 1
and 1
goes 1
out 1
with 1
footman 1
gwendolen 1
drinks 1
the 1
tea 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
grimace 1
puts 1
down 1
cup 1
at 1
once 1
reaches 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
looks 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
finds 1
it 1
is 1
cake 1
rises 1
in 1
indignation 1
gwendolen 1
you 1
have 1
filled 1
my 1
tea 1
with 1
lumps 1
of 1
sugar 1
and 1
though 1
i 1
asked 1
most 1
distinctly 1
for 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
cake 1
i 1
am 1
known 1
for 1
the 1
gentleness 1
of 1
my 1
disposition 1
and 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
sweetness 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
but 1
i 1
warn 1
you 1
miss 1
cardew 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
too 1
far 1
cecily 1
rising 1
to 1
save 1
my 1
poor 1
innocent 1
trusting 1
boy 1
from 1
the 1
machinations 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
girl 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
lengths 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
gwendolen 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
i 1
distrusted 1
you 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
false 1
and 1
deceitful 1
i 1
am 1
never 1
deceived 1
in 1
such 1
matters 1
my 1
first 1
impressions 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
invariably 1
right 1
cecily 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
trespassing 1
on 1
your 1
valuable 1
time 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
many 1
other 1
calls 1
of 1
a 1
similar 1
character 1
to 1
make 1
in 1

my 1

moncrieff 1
cecily 1
breaking 1
away 1
from 1

algernon 1
moncrieff 1
oh 1
the 1
two 1
girls 1
move 1
towards 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
put 1
their 1
arms 1
round 1
each 1
others 1
waists 1
as 1
if 1
for 1
protection 1
cecily 1
are 1
you 1
called 1
algernon 1
algernon 1
i 1
cannot 1
deny 1
it 1
cecily 1
oh 1
gwendolen 1
is 1
your 1
name 1
really 1
john 1
jack 1
standing 1
rather 1
proudly 1
i 1
could 1
deny 1
it 1
if 1
i 1
liked 1
i 1
could 1
deny 1
anything 1
if 1
i 1
liked 1
but 1
my 1
name 1
certainly 1
is 1
john 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
john 1
for 1
years 1
cecily 1
to 1
gwendolen 1
a 1
gross 1
deception 1
has 1
been 1
practised 1
on 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
gwendolen 1
my 1
poor 1
wounded 1
cecily 1
cecily 1
my 1
sweet 1
wronged 1
gwendolen 1
gwendolen 1
slowly 1
and 1
seriously 1
you 1
will 1
call 1
me 1
sister 1
will 1
you 1
not 1
they 1
embrace 1
jack 1
and 1
algernon 1
groan 1
and 1
walk 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
cecily 1
rather 1
brightly 1
there 1
is 1
just 1
one 1
question 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
ask 1
my 1
guardian 1
gwendolen 1
an 1
admirable 1
idea 1
mr 1
worthing 1
there 1
is 1
just 1
one 1
question 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
permitted 1
to 1
put 1
to 1
you 1
where 1
is 1
your 1
brother 1
ernest 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
your 1
brother 1
ernest 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
some 1
importance 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
your 1
brother 1
ernest 1
is 1
at 1
present 1
jack 1
slowly 1
and 1
hesitatingly 1
gwendolencecilyit 1
is 1
very 1
painful 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
painful 1
position 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
really 1
quite 1
inexperienced 1
in 1
doing 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
however 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
quite 1
frankly 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
ernest 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
i 1
certainly 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
smallest 1
intention 1
of 1
ever 1
having 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
cecily 1
surprised 1
no 1
brother 1
at 1
all 1
jack 1
cheerily 1
none 1
gwendolen 1
severely 1
had 1
you 1
never 1
a 1
brother 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
jack 1
pleasantly 1
never 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
cecily 1
that 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
cecily 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
pleasant 1
position 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
suddenly 1
to 1
find 1
herself 1
in 1
is 1
it 1
gwendolen 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
they 1
will 1
hardly 1
venture 1
to 1
come 1
after 1
us 1
there 1
cecily 1
no 1
men 1
are 1
so 1
cowardly 1
arent 1
they 1
they 1
retire 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
scornful 1
looks 1
jack 1
this 1
ghastly 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
call 1
bunburying 1
i 1
suppose 1
algernon 1
yes 1
and 1
a 1
perfectly 1
wonderful 1
bunbury 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
bunbury 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
jack 1
well 1
youve 1
no 1
right 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
bunbury 1
here 1
algernon 1
that 1
is 1
absurd 1
one 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
bunbury 1
anywhere 1
one 1
chooses 1
every 1
serious 1
bunburyist 1
knows 1
that 1
jack 1
serious 1
bunburyist 1
good 1
heavens 1
algernon 1
well 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
something 1
if 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
amusement 1
in 1
life 1
i 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
bunburying 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
you 1
are 1
serious 1
about 1
i 1
havent 1
got 1
the 1
remotest 1
idea 1
about 1
everything 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
you 1
have 1
such 1
an 1
absolutely 1
trivial 1
nature 1
jack 1
well 1
the 1
only 1
small 1
satisfaction 1
i 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
this 1
wretched 1
business 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
friend 1
bunbury 1
is 1
quite 1
exploded 1
you 1
wont 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
run 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
quite 1
so 1
often 1
as 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
dear 1
algy 1
and 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
thing 1
too 1
algernon 1
your 1
brother 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
off 1
colour 1
isnt 1
he 1
dear 1
jack 1
you 1
wont 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
disappear 1
to 1
london 1
quite 1
so 1
frequently 1
as 1
your 1
wicked 1
custom 1
was 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
thing 1
either 1
jack 1
as 1
for 1
your 1
conduct 1
towards 1
miss 1
cardew 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
your 1
taking 1
in 1
a 1
sweet 1
simple 1
innocent 1
girl 1
like 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
inexcusable 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
ward 1
algernon 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
no 1
possible 1
defence 1
at 1
all 1
for 1
your 1
deceiving 1
a 1
brilliant 1
clever 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
young 1
lady 1
like 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
cousin 1
jack 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
engaged 1
to 1
gwendolen 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
love 1
her 1
algernon 1
well 1
i 1
simply 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
engaged 1
to 1
cecily 1
i 1
adore 1
her 1
jack 1
there 1
is 1
certainly 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
your 1
marrying 1
miss 1
cardew 1
algernon 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
there 1
is 1
much 1
likelihood 1
jack 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
being 1
united 1
jack 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
yours 1
algernon 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
business 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
begins 1
to 1
eat 1
muffins 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
vulgar 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
ones 1
business 1
only 1
people 1
like 1
stockbrokers 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
then 1
merely 1
at 1
dinner 1
parties 1
jack 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
sit 1
there 1
calmly 1
eating 1
muffins 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
this 1
horrible 1
trouble 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
out 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
algernon 1
well 1
i 1
cant 1
eat 1
muffins 1
in 1
an 1
agitated 1
manner 1
the 1
butter 1
would 1
probably 1
get 1
on 1
my 1
cuffs 1
one 1
should 1
always 1
eat 1
muffins 1
quite 1
calmly 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
eat 1
them 1
jack 1
i 1
say 1
its 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
your 1
eating 1
muffins 1
at 1
all 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
algernon 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
trouble 1
eating 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
consoles 1
me 1
indeed 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
really 1
great 1
trouble 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
who 1
knows 1
me 1
intimately 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
i 1
refuse 1
everything 1
except 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
i 1
am 1
eating 1
muffins 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
unhappy 1
besides 1
i 1
am 1
particularly 1
fond 1
of 1
muffins 1
rising 1
jack 1
rising 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
eat 1
them 1
all 1
in 1
that 1
greedy 1
way 1
takes 1
muffins 1
from 1
algernon 1
algernon 1
offering 1
teacake 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
teacake 1
instead 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
teacake 1
jack 1
good 1
heavens 1
i 1
suppose 1
a 1
man 1
may 1
eat 1
his 1
own 1
muffins 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
garden 1
algernon 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
to 1
eat 1
muffins 1
jack 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
of 1
you 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
thing 1
algernon 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
but 1
the 1
muffins 1
are 1
the 1
same 1
he 1
seizes 1
the 1
muffindish 1
from 1
jack 1
jack 1
algy 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
you 1
would 1
go 1
algernon 1
you 1
cant 1
possibly 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
without 1
having 1
some 1
dinner 1
its 1
absurd 1
i 1
never 1
go 1
without 1
my 1
dinner 1
no 1
one 1
ever 1
does 1
except 1
vegetarians 1
and 1
people 1
like 1
that 1
besides 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
made 1
arrangements 1
with 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
at 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
six 1
under 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
ernest 1
jack 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
the 1
sooner 1
you 1
give 1
up 1
that 1
nonsense 1
the 1
better 1
i 1
made 1
arrangements 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
myself 1
at 1
530 1
and 1
i 1
naturally 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
ernest 1
gwendolen 1
would 1
wish 1
it 1
we 1
cant 1
both 1
be 1
christened 1
ernest 1
its 1
absurd 1
besides 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
perfect 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
if 1
i 1
like 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
evidence 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
christened 1
by 1
anybody 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
extremely 1
probable 1
i 1
never 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
does 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
different 1
in 1
your 1
case 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
algernon 1
yes 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
christened 1
for 1
years 1
jack 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
important 1
thing 1
algernon 1
quite 1
so 1
so 1
i 1
know 1
my 1
constitution 1
can 1
stand 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
sure 1
about 1
your 1
ever 1
having 1
been 1
christened 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
rather 1
dangerous 1
your 1
venturing 1
on 1
it 1
now 1
it 1
might 1
make 1
you 1
very 1
unwell 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
have 1
forgotten 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
very 1
closely 1
connected 1
with 1
you 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
carried 1
off 1
this 1
week 1
in 1
paris 1
by 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
jack 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
said 1
yourself 1
that 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
was 1
not 1
hereditary 1
algernon 1
it 1
usent 1
to 1
be 1
i 1
knowbut 1
i 1
daresay 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
science 1
is 1
always 1
making 1
wonderful 1
improvements 1
in 1
things 1
jack 1
picking 1
up 1
the 1
muffindish 1
oh 1

is 1
nonsense 1

to 1
be 1
served 1
up 1
for 1
your 1
guests 1

are 1
at 1

the 1
fact 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
follow 1
us 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
some 1
sense 1
of 1
shame 1
left 1
cecily 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
eating 1
muffins 1
that 1
looks 1

repentance 1
gwendolen 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
they 1
dont 1

to 1
notice 1
us 1
at 1

very 1
forward 1
of 1
them 1
gwendolen 1
let 1
us 1
preserve 1
a 1
dignified 1
silence 1
cecily 1
certainly 1
its 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
enter 1
jack 1
followed 1
by 1
algernon 1
they 1
whistle 1
some 1
dreadful 1
popular 1
air 1
from 1
a 1
british 1
opera 1
gwendolen 1
this 1
dignified 1
silence 1
seems 1
to 1
produce 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
effect 1
cecily 1
a 1
most 1
distasteful 1
one 1
gwendolen 1
but 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
speak 1
cecily 1
certainly 1
not 1
gwendolen 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
have 1
something 1
very 1
particular 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
much 1
depends 1
on 1
your 1
reply 1
cecily 1
gwendolen 1
your 1
common 1
sense 1
is 1
invaluable 1
mr 1
moncrieff 1
kindly 1
answer 1
me 1
the 1
following 1
question 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
guardians 1
brother 1
algernon 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
meeting 1
you 1
cecily 1
to 1
gwendolen 1
that 1
certainly 1
seems 1
a 1
satisfactory 1
explanation 1
does 1
it 1
not 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
dear 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
believe 1
him 1
cecily 1
i 1
dont 1
but 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
affect 1
the 1
wonderful 1
beauty 1
of 1
his 1
answer 1
gwendolen 1
true 1
in 1
matters 1
of 1
grave 1
importance 1
style 1
not 1
sincerity 1
is 1
the 1
vital 1
thing 1
mr 1
worthing 1
what 1
explanation 1
can 1
you 1
offer 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
pretending 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
was 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
coming 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
possible 1
jack 1
can 1
you 1
doubt 1
it 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
gravest 1
doubts 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
i 1
intend 1
to 1
crush 1
them 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
moment 1
for 1
german 1
scepticism 1
moving 1
to 1
cecily 1
their 1
explanations 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
satisfactory 1
especially 1
mr 1
worthings 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
stamp 1
of 1
truth 1
upon 1
it 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
more 1
than 1
content 1
with 1
what 1
mr 1
moncrieff 1
said 1
his 1
voice 1
alone 1
inspires 1
one 1
with 1
absolute 1
credulity 1
gwendolen 1
then 1
you 1
think 1
we 1
should 1
forgive 1
them 1
cecily 1
yes 1
i 1
mean 1
no 1
gwendolen 1
true 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
there 1
are 1
principles 1
at 1
stake 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
surrender 1
which 1
of 1
us 1
should 1
tell 1
them 1
the 1
task 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
pleasant 1
one 1
cecily 1
could 1
we 1
not 1
both 1
speak 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
gwendolen 1
an 1
excellent 1
idea 1
i 1
nearly 1
always 1
speak 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
other 1
people 1
will 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
time 1
from 1
me 1
cecily 1
certainly 1
gwendolen 1
beats 1
time 1
with 1
uplifted 1
finger 1
gwendolen 1
and 1
cecily 1
speaking 1
together 1
your 1
christian 1
names 1
are 1
still 1
an 1
insuperable 1
barrier 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
jack 1
and 1
algernon 1
speaking 1
together 1
our 1
christian 1
names 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
this 1
afternoon 1
gwendolen 1
to 1
jack 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
you 1
are 1
prepared 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
terrible 1
thing 1

please 1

are 1
ready 1
to 1
face 1
this 1
fearful 1
ordeal 1
algernon 1
i 1
am 1
gwendolen 1
how 1
absurd 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
equality 1
of 1
the 1
sexes 1
where 1
questions 1
of 1
selfsacrifice 1
are 1
concerned 1
men 1
are 1
infinitely 1
beyond 1
us 1
jack 1
we 1
are 1
clasps 1
hands 1
with 1
algernon 1
cecily 1
they 1
have 1
moments 1
of 1
physical 1
courage 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
women 1
know 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
gwendolen 1
to 1

into 1

at 1

gave 1
his 1
evidence 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shown 1
horner 1
up 1
to 1
the 1

of 1
the 1

of 1
morcar 1
upon 1
the 1

that 1

might 1
solder 1
the 1
second 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
grate 1
which 1
was 1
loose 1
he 1
had 1
remained 1
with 1
horner 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
but 1
had 1
finally 1
been 1
called 1
away 1
on 1
returning 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
horner 1
had 1
disappeared 1
that 1
the 1
bureau 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
open 1
and 1
that 1
the 1

as 1
it 1
afterwards 1

the 1

jewel 1
was 1
lying 1
empty 1
upon 1
the 1

ryder 1
instantly 1
gave 1
the 1
alarm 1
and 1
horner 1
was 1
arrested 1
the 1
same 1
evening 1
but 1
the 1
stone 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
found 1
either 1
upon 1
his 1
person 1
or 1
in 1
his 1
rooms 1
catherine 1
cusack 1
maid 1
to 1
the 1

deposed 1
to 1
having 1
heard 1
ryders 1
cry 1
of 1
dismay 1
on 1
discovering 1
the 1
robbery 1
and 1
to 1
having 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
she 1
found 1
matters 1
as 1
described 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
witness 1
inspector 1
bradstreet 1
b 1
division 1
gave 1
evidence 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
arrest 1
of 1
horner 1
who 1
struggled 1
frantically 1
and 1
protested 1
his 1
innocence 1
in 1
the 1
strongest 1
terms 1
evidence 1
of 1
a 1
previous 1
conviction 1
for 1
robbery 1
having 1
been 1
given 1
against 1
the 1
prisoner 1
the 1
magistrate 1
refused 1
to 1
deal 1
summarily 1
with 1
the 1
offence 1
but 1
referred 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
assizes 1
horner 1
who 1
had 1
shown 1
signs 1
of 1
intense 1
emotion 1
during 1
the 1
proceedings 1
fainted 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
conclusion 1
and 1
was 1
carried 1
out 1
of 1
court 1
hum 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
policecourt 1
said 1
holmes 1
thoughtfully 1
tossing 1
aside 1
the 1
paper 1
the 1
question 1
for 1
us 1
now 1
to 1
solve 1
is 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
leading 1
from 1
a 1
rifled 1
jewelcase 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
crop 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
in 1
tottenham 1
court 1
road 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
you 1
see 1
watson 1
our 1
little 1
deductions 1
have 1
suddenly 1
assumed 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
important 1
and 1
less 1
innocent 1
aspect 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
stone 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
the 1
goose 1
came 1
from 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
the 1
gentleman 1
with 1
the 1
bad 1
hat 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
characteristics 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
bored 1
you 1
so 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
set 1
ourselves 1
very 1
seriously 1
to 1
finding 1
this 1
gentleman 1
and 1
ascertaining 1
what 1
part 1
he 1
has 1
played 1
in 1
this 1
little 1
mystery 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
we 1
must 1
try 1
the 1
simplest 1
means 1
first 1
and 1
these 1
lie 1
undoubtedly 1
in 1
an 1
advertisement 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
evening 1
papers 1
if 1
this 1
fail 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
recourse 1
to 1
other 1
methods 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
say 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
pencil 1
and 1
that 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
now 1
then 1
found 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
goodge 1
street 1
a 1
goose 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
felt 1
hat 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
can 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
by 1
applying 1
at 1
630 1
this 1
evening 1
at 1
221b 1
baker 1
street 1
that 1
is 1
clear 1
and 1
concise 1
very 1
but 1
will 1
he 1
see 1
it 1
well 1
he 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
papers 1
since 1
to 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
the 1
loss 1
was 1
a 1
heavy 1
one 1
he 1
was 1
clearly 1
so 1
scared 1
by 1
his 1
mischance 1
in 1
breaking 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
peterson 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
flight 1
but 1
since 1
then 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
bitterly 1
regretted 1
the 1
impulse 1
which 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
drop 1
his 1
bird 1
then 1
again 1
the 1
introduction 1
of 1
his 1
name 1
will 1
cause 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
for 1
everyone 1
who 1
knows 1
him 1
will 1
direct 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
here 1
you 1
are 1
peterson 1
run 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
advertising 1
agency 1
and 1
have 1
this 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
papers 1
in 1
which 1
sir 1
oh 1
in 1
the 1
globe 1

evening 1
news 1
standard 1
echo 1
and 1
any 1
others 1
that 1
occur 1
to 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
sir 1
and 1
this 1
stone 1
ah 1
yes 1
i 1
shall 1
keep 1
the 1
stone 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
say 1
peterson 1
just 1
buy 1
a 1
goose 1
on 1
your 1
way 1
back 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
here 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
one 1
to 1
give 1
to 1
this 1
gentleman 1
in 1
place 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
your 1
family 1
is 1
now 1
devouring 1
when 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
had 1
gone 1
holmes 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
light 1
its 1
a 1
bonny 1
thing 1
said 1
he 1
just 1
see 1
how 1
it 1
glints 1
and 1
sparkles 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
nucleus 1
and 1
focus 1
of 1
crime 1
every 1
good 1
stone 1
is 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
devils 1
pet 1
baits 1
in 1
the 1
larger 1
and 1
older 1
jewels 1
every 1
facet 1
may 1
stand 1
for 1
a 1
bloody 1
deed 1
this 1
stone 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
twenty 1
years 1
old 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
amoy 1
river 1
in 1
southern 1
china 1
and 1
is 1
remarkable 1
in 1
having 1
every 1
characteristic 1
of 1
the 1
carbuncle 1
save 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
blue 1
in 1
shade 1
instead 1
of 1
ruby 1
red 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
its 1
youth 1
it 1
has 1
already 1
a 1
sinister 1
history 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
two 1
murders 1
a 1
vitriolthrowing 1
a 1
suicide 1
and 1
several 1
robberies 1
brought 1
about 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
this 1
fortygrain 1
weight 1
of 1
crystallised 1
charcoal 1
who 1
would 1
think 1
that 1
so 1
pretty 1
a 1
toy 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
purveyor 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
and 1
the 1
prison 1
ill 1
lock 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
strong 1
box 1
now 1
and 1
drop 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
the 1
countess 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
it 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
horner 1
is 1
innocent 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
well 1
then 1
do 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
this 1
other 1
one 1
henry 1
baker 1
had 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
think 1
much 1
more 1
likely 1
that 1
henry 1
baker 1
is 1
an 1
absolutely 1
innocent 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
carrying 1
was 1
of 1
considerably 1
more 1
value 1
than 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
solid 1
gold 1
that 1
however 1
i 1
shall 1
determine 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
simple 1
test 1
if 1
we 1
have 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
our 1
advertisement 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
then 1
nothing 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
i 1
shall 1
continue 1
my 1
professional 1
round 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
you 1
have 1
mentioned 1
for 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
solution 1
of 1
so 1
tangled 1
a 1
business 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
i 1
dine 1
at 1
seven 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
woodcock 1
i 1
believe 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
view 1
of 1
recent 1
occurrences 1
perhaps 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
ask 1
mrs 1
hudson 1
to 1
examine 1
its 1
crop 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
delayed 1
at 1
a 1
case 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
halfpast 1
six 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
once 1
more 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
scotch 1
bonnet 1
with 1
a 1
coat 1
which 1
was 1
buttoned 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
chin 1
waiting 1
outside 1
in 1
the 1
bright 1
semicircle 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
from 1
the 1
fanlight 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
arrived 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
shown 1
up 1
together 1
to 1
holmes 1
room 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
i 1
believe 1
said 1
he 1
rising 1
from 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
greeting 1
his 1
visitor 1
with 1
the 1
easy 1
air 1
of 1
geniality 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
so 1
readily 1
assume 1
pray 1
take 1
this 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
mr 1
baker 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
and 1
i 1
observe 1
that 1
your 1
circulation 1
is 1
more 1
adapted 1
for 1
summer 1
than 1
for 1
winter 1
ah 1
watson 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
come 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
hat 1
mr 1
baker 1
yes 1
sir 1
that 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
my 1
hat 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
man 1
with 1
rounded 1
shoulders 1
a 1
massive 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
broad 1
intelligent 1
face 1
sloping 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
pointed 1
beard 1
of 1
grizzled 1
brown 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
nose 1
and 1
cheeks 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
tremor 1
of 1
his 1
extended 1
hand 1
recalled 1
holmes 1
surmise 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
habits 1
his 1
rusty 1
black 1
frockcoat 1
was 1
buttoned 1
right 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
with 1
the 1
collar 1
turned 1
up 1
and 1
his 1
lank 1
wrists 1
protruded 1
from 1
his 1
sleeves 1
without 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
cuff 1
or 1
shirt 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
slow 1
staccato 1
fashion 1
choosing 1
his 1
words 1
with 1
care 1
and 1
gave 1
the 1
impression 1
generally 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
letters 1
who 1
had 1
had 1
illusage 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
fortune 1
we 1
have 1
retained 1
these 1
things 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
said 1
holmes 1
because 1
we 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
advertisement 1
from 1
you 1
giving 1
your 1
address 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
to 1
know 1
now 1
why 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
advertise 1
our 1
visitor 1
gave 1
a 1
rather 1
shamefaced 1
laugh 1
shillings 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
so 1
plentiful 1
with 1
me 1
as 1
they 1
once 1
were 1
he 1
remarked 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
gang 1
of 1
roughs 1
who 1
assaulted 1
me 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
both 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
spend 1
more 1
money 1
in 1
a 1
hopeless 1
attempt 1
at 1
recovering 1
them 1
very 1
naturally 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
about 1
the 1
bird 1
we 1
were 1
compelled 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
our 1
visitor 1
half 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
in 1
his 1
excitement 1
yes 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
anyone 1
had 1
we 1
not 1
done 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
presume 1
that 1
this 1
other 1
goose 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
which 1
is 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
weight 1
and 1
perfectly 1
fresh 1
will 1
answer 1
your 1
purpose 1
equally 1
well 1
oh 1
certainly 1
certainly 1
answered 1
mr 1
baker 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
still 1
have 1
the 1
feathers 1
legs 1
crop 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
bird 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
the 1
man 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
hearty 1
laugh 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
relics 1
of 1
my 1
adventure 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
beyond 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
see 1
what 1
use 1
the 1
disjecta 1
membra 1
of 1
my 1
late 1
acquaintance 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
sir 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
i 1
will 1
confine 1
my 1
attentions 1
to 1
the 1
excellent 1
bird 1
which 1
i 1
perceive 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
glanced 1
sharply 1
across 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
shrug 1
of 1
his 1
shoulders 1
there 1
is 1
your 1
hat 1
then 1
and 1
there 1
your 1
bird 1
said 1
he 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
would 1
it 1
bore 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
you 1
got 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
from 1
i 1
am 1
somewhat 1
of 1
a 1
fowl 1
fancier 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
seldom 1
seen 1
a 1
better 1
grown 1
goose 1
certainly 1
sir 1
said 1
baker 1
who 1
had 1
risen 1
and 1
tucked 1
his 1
newly 1
gained 1
property 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
there 1
are 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
frequent 1
the 1
alpha 1
inn 1
near 1
the 1
museumwe 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
museum 1
itself 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
you 1
understand 1
this 1
year 1
our 1
good 1
host 1
windigate 1
by 1
name 1
instituted 1
a 1
goose 1
club 1
by 1
which 1
on 1
consideration 1
of 1
some 1
few 1
pence 1
every 1
week 1
we 1
were 1
each 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
bird 1
at 1
christmas 1
my 1
pence 1
were 1
duly 1
paid 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
sir 1
for 1
a 1
scotch 1
bonnet 1
is 1
fitted 1
neither 1
to 1
my 1
years 1
nor 1
my 1
gravity 1
with 1
a 1
comical 1
pomposity 1
of 1
manner 1
he 1
bowed 1
solemnly 1
to 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
strode 1
off 1
upon 1
his 1
way 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
said 1
holmes 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
certain 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
nothing 1
whatever 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
are 1
you 1
hungry 1
watson 1
not 1
particularly 1
then 1
i 1
suggest 1
that 1
we 1
turn 1
our 1
dinner 1
into 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
follow 1
up 1
this 1
clue 1
while 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
hot 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bitter 1
night 1
so 1
we 1
drew 1
on 1
our 1
ulsters 1
and 1
wrapped 1
cravats 1
about 1
our 1
throats 1
outside 1
the 1
stars 1
were 1
shining 1
coldly 1
in 1
a 1
cloudless 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
of 1
the 1
passersby 1
blew 1
out 1
into 1
smoke 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
pistol 1
shots 1
our 1
footfalls 1
rang 1
out 1
crisply 1
and 1
loudly 1
as 1
we 1
swung 1
through 1
the 1
doctors 1
quarter 1
wimpole 1
street 1
harley 1
street 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
wigmore 1
street 1
into 1
oxford 1
street 1
in 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
bloomsbury 1
at 1
the 1
alpha 1
inn 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
publichouse 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
streets 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
into 1
holborn 1
holmes 1
pushed 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
private 1
bar 1
and 1
ordered 1
two 1
glasses 1
of 1
beer 1
from 1
the 1
ruddyfaced 1
whiteaproned 1
landlord 1
your 1
beer 1
should 1
be 1
excellent 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
your 1
geese 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
geese 1
the 1
man 1
seemed 1
surprised 1
yes 1
i 1
was 1
speaking 1
only 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
ago 1
to 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
your 1
goose 1
club 1
ah 1
yes 1
i 1
see 1
but 1
you 1
see 1
sir 1
thems 1
not 1
our 1
geese 1
indeed 1
whose 1
then 1
well 1
i 1
got 1
the 1
two 1
dozen 1
from 1
a 1
salesman 1
in 1
covent 1
garden 1
indeed 1
i 1
know 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
which 1
was 1
it 1
breckinridge 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
ah 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
him 1
well 1
heres 1
your 1
good 1
health 1
landlord 1
and 1
prosperity 1
to 1
your 1
house 1
goodnight 1
now 1
for 1
mr 1
breckinridge 1
he 1
continued 1
buttoning 1
up 1
his 1
coat 1
as 1
we 1
came 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
frosty 1
air 1
remember 1
watson 1
that 1
though 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
homely 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
goose 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
chain 1
we 1
have 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
will 1
certainly 1
get 1
seven 1
years 1
penal 1
servitude 1
unless 1
we 1
can 1
establish 1
his 1
innocence 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
our 1
inquiry 1
may 1
but 1
confirm 1
his 1
guilt 1
but 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
investigation 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
missed 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
which 1
a 1
singular 1
chance 1
has 1
placed 1
in 1
our 1
hands 1
let 1
us 1
follow 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
bitter 1
end 1
faces 1
to 1
the 1
south 1
then 1
and 1
quick 1
march 1
we 1
passed 1
across 1
holborn 1
down 1
endell 1
street 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
a 1
zigzag 1
of 1
slums 1
to 1
covent 1
garden 1
market 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
largest 1
stalls 1
bore 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
breckinridge 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
proprietor 1
a 1
horseylooking 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
face 1
and 1
trim 1
sidewhiskers 1
was 1
helping 1
a 1
boy 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
the 1
shutters 1
goodevening 1
its 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
said 1
holmes 1
the 1
salesman 1
nodded 1
and 1
shot 1
a 1
questioning 1
glance 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
sold 1
out 1
of 1
geese 1
i 1
see 1
continued 1
holmes 1
pointing 1
at 1
the 1
bare 1
slabs 1
of 1
marble 1
let 1
you 1
have 1
five 1
hundred 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
thats 1
no 1
good 1
well 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
on 1
the 1
stall 1
with 1
the 1
gasflare 1
ah 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
recommended 1
to 1
you 1
who 1
by 1
the 1
landlord 1
of 1
the 1
alpha 1
oh 1
yes 1
i 1
sent 1
him 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
dozen 1
fine 1
birds 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
now 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
them 1
from 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
the 1
question 1
provoked 1
a 1
burst 1
of 1
anger 1
from 1
the 1
salesman 1
now 1
then 1
mister 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
cocked 1
and 1
his 1
arms 1
akimbo 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
driving 1
at 1
lets 1
have 1
it 1
straight 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
straight 1
enough 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
who 1
sold 1
you 1
the 1
geese 1
which 1
you 1
supplied 1
to 1
the 1
alpha 1
well 1
then 1
i 1
shant 1
tell 1
you 1
so 1
now 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
warm 1
over 1
such 1
a 1
trifle 1
warm 1
youd 1
be 1
as 1
warm 1
maybe 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
as 1
pestered 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
when 1
i 1
pay 1
good 1
money 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
article 1
there 1
should 1
be 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
but 1
its 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
geese 1
and 1
who 1
did 1
you 1
sell 1
the 1
geese 1
to 1
and 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
take 1
for 1
the 1
geese 1
one 1
would 1
think 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
geese 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
fuss 1
that 1
is 1
made 1
over 1
them 1
well 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
connection 1
with 1
any 1
other 1
people 1
who 1

back 1
my 1

the 1

its 1
nothing 1
of 1

kind 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
it 1
dyou 1

about 1

ever 1
since 1

never 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1

you 1

then 1
its 1
merely 1
taking 1
your 1

12s 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
to 1

now 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
looked 1
deeply 1
chagrined 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
sovereign 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
slab 1
turning 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
disgust 1
is 1
too 1
deep 1
for 1
words 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
off 1
he 1
stopped 1
under 1
a 1
lamppost 1
and 1
laughed 1
in 1
the 1
hearty 1
noiseless 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
peculiar 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
you 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
whiskers 1
of 1
that 1
cut 1
and 1
the 1
pink 1
un 1
protruding 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
you 1
can 1
always 1
draw 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
bet 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
daresay 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
put 1
100 1
pounds 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
man 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
such 1
complete 1
information 1
as 1
was 1
drawn 1
from 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
me 1
on 1
a 1
wager 1
well 1
watson 1
we 1
are 1
i 1
fancy 1
nearing 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
quest 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
point 1
which 1
remains 1
to 1
be 1
determined 1
is 1
whether 1
we 1
should 1
go 1
on 1
to 1
this 1
mrs 1
oakshott 1
tonight 1
or 1
whether 1
we 1
should 1
reserve 1
it 1
for 1
tomorrow 1
it 1
is 1
clear 1
from 1
what 1
that 1
surly 1
fellow 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
others 1
besides 1
ourselves 1
who 1
are 1
anxious 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
his 1
remarks 1
were 1
suddenly 1
cut 1
short 1
by 1
a 1
loud 1
hubbub 1
which 1
broke 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
stall 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
left 1
turning 1
round 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
ratfaced 1
fellow 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
by 1
the 1
swinging 1
lamp 1
while 1
breckinridge 1
the 1
salesman 1
framed 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
stall 1
was 1
shaking 1
his 1
fists 1
fiercely 1
at 1
the 1
cringing 1
figure 1
ive 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
geese 1
he 1
shouted 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
were 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
devil 1
together 1
if 1
you 1
come 1
pestering 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
with 1
your 1
silly 1
talk 1
ill 1
set 1
the 1
dog 1
at 1
you 1
you 1
bring 1
mrs 1
oakshott 1
here 1
and 1
ill 1
answer 1
her 1
but 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
did 1
i 1
buy 1
the 1
geese 1
off 1
you 1
no 1
but 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
mine 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
whined 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
well 1
then 1
ask 1
mrs 1
oakshott 1
for 1
it 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
well 1
you 1
can 1
ask 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
proosia 1
for 1
all 1
i 1
care 1
ive 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
he 1
rushed 1
fiercely 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
inquirer 1
flitted 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
ha 1
this 1
may 1
save 1
us 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
brixton 1
road 1
whispered 1
holmes 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
see 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
of 1
this 1
fellow 1
striding 1
through 1
the 1
scattered 1
knots 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
lounged 1
round 1
the 1
flaring 1
stalls 1
my 1
companion 1
speedily 1
overtook 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
touched 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
shoulder 1
he 1
sprang 1
round 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
in 1
the 1
gaslight 1
that 1
every 1
vestige 1
of 1
colour 1
had 1
been 1
driven 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
he 1
asked 1
in 1
a 1
quavering 1
voice 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
said 1
holmes 1
blandly 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
overhearing 1
the 1
questions 1
which 1
you 1
put 1
to 1
the 1
salesman 1
just 1
now 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
know 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
business 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
other 1
people 1
dont 1
know 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
this 1
excuse 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
everything 1
of 1
it 1
you 1
are 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
trace 1
some 1
geese 1
which 1
were 1
sold 1
by 1
mrs 1
oakshott 1
of 1
brixton 1
road 1
to 1
a 1
salesman 1
named 1
breckinridge 1
by 1
him 1
in 1
turn 1
to 1
mr 1
windigate 1
of 1
the 1
alpha 1
and 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
club 1
of 1
which 1
mr 1
henry 1
baker 1
is 1
a 1
member 1
oh 1
sir 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
man 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
longed 1
to 1
meet 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
fellow 1
with 1
outstretched 1
hands 1
and 1
quivering 1
fingers 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
explain 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
interested 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
hailed 1
a 1
fourwheeler 1
which 1
was 1
passing 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
discuss 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
cosy 1
room 1
rather 1
than 1
in 1
this 1
windswept 1
marketplace 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
farther 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
assisting 1
the 1
man 1
hesitated 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
john 1
robinson 1
he 1
answered 1
with 1
a 1
sidelong 1
glance 1
no 1
no 1
the 1
real 1
name 1
said 1
holmes 1
sweetly 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
awkward 1
doing 1
business 1
with 1
an 1
alias 1
a 1
flush 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
white 1
cheeks 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
well 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
real 1
name 1
is 1
james 1
ryder 1
precisely 1
so 1
head 1
attendant 1
at 1
the 1
hotel 1
cosmopolitan 1
pray 1
step 1
into 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
everything 1
which 1
you 1
would 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
stood 1
glancing 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
halffrightened 1
halfhopeful 1
eyes 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
not 1
sure 1
whether 1
he 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
a 1
windfall 1
or 1
of 1
a 1
catastrophe 1
then 1
he 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
were 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
nothing 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
during 1
our 1
drive 1
but 1
the 1
high 1
thin 1
breathing 1
of 1
our 1
new 1
companion 1
and 1
the 1
claspings 1
and 1
unclaspings 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
spoke 1
of 1
the 1
nervous 1
tension 1
within 1
him 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
said 1
holmes 1
cheerily 1
as 1
we 1
filed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
fire 1
looks 1
very 1
seasonable 1
in 1
this 1
weather 1
you 1
look 1
cold 1
mr 1
ryder 1
pray 1
take 1
the 1
basketchair 1
i 1
will 1
just 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
slippers 1
before 1
we 1
settle 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
of 1
yours 1
now 1
then 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
those 1
geese 1
yes 1
sir 1
or 1
rather 1
i 1
fancy 1
of 1
that 1
goose 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
bird 1
i 1
imagine 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
were 1
interestedwhite 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
bar 1
across 1
the 1
tail 1
ryder 1
quivered 1
with 1
emotion 1
oh 1
sir 1
he 1
cried 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
it 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
came 1
here 1
here 1
yes 1
and 1
a 1
most 1
remarkable 1
bird 1
it 1
proved 1
i 1
dont 1
wonder 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
take 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
it 1
it 1
laid 1
an 1
egg 1
after 1
it 1
was 1
deadthe 1
bonniest 1
brightest 1
little 1
blue 1
egg 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
seen 1
i 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
in 1
my 1
museum 1
our 1
visitor 1
staggered 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
clutched 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
holmes 1
unlocked 1
his 1
strongbox 1
and 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
which 1
shone 1
out 1
like 1
a 1
star 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
brilliant 1
manypointed 1
radiance 1
ryder 1
stood 1
glaring 1
with 1
a 1
drawn 1
face 1
uncertain 1
whether 1
to 1
claim 1
or 1
to 1
disown 1
it 1
the 1
games 1
up 1
ryder 1
said 1
holmes 1
quietly 1
hold 1
up 1
man 1
or 1
youll 1
be 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
give 1
him 1
an 1
arm 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
watson 1
hes 1
not 1
got 1
blood 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
felony 1
with 1
impunity 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
dash 1
of 1
brandy 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
looks 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
human 1
what 1
a 1
shrimp 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
staggered 1
and 1
nearly 1
fallen 1
but 1
the 1
brandy 1
brought 1
a 1
tinge 1
of 1
colour 1
into 1
his 1
cheeks 1
and 1
he 1
sat 1
staring 1
with 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
at 1
his 1
accuser 1
i 1
have 1
almost 1
every 1
link 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
proofs 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
possibly 1
need 1
so 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
which 1
you 1
need 1
tell 1
me 1
still 1
that 1
little 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
case 1
complete 1
you 1
had 1
heard 1
ryder 1
of 1
this 1
blue 1
stone 1
of 1
the 1
countess 1
of 1
morcars 1
it 1
was 1
catherine 1
cusack 1
who 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
in 1
a 1
crackling 1
voice 1
i 1
seeher 1
ladyships 1
waitingmaid 1
well 1
the 1
temptation 1
of 1
sudden 1
wealth 1
so 1
easily 1
acquired 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
you 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
for 1
better 1
men 1
before 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
very 1
scrupulous 1
in 1
the 1
means 1
you 1
used 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
ryder 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
making 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
villain 1
in 1
you 1
you 1
knew 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
horner 1
the 1
plumber 1
had 1
been 1
concerned 1
in 1
some 1
such 1
matter 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
suspicion 1
would 1
rest 1
the 1
more 1
readily 1
upon 1
him 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
you 1
made 1
some 1
small 1
job 1
in 1
my 1
ladys 1
roomyou 1
and 1
your 1
confederate 1
cusackand 1
you 1
managed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
man 1
sent 1
for 1
then 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
you 1
rifled 1
the 1
jewelcase 1
raised 1
the 1
alarm 1
and 1
had 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
man 1
arrested 1
you 1
then 1
ryder 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
the 1
rug 1
and 1
clutched 1
at 1
my 1
companions 1
knees 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
have 1
mercy 1
he 1
shrieked 1
think 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
it 1
would 1
break 1
their 1
hearts 1
i 1
never 1
went 1
wrong 1
before 1
i 1
never 1
will 1
again 1
i 1
swear 1
it 1
ill 1
swear 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
bible 1
oh 1
dont 1
bring 1
it 1
into 1
court 1
for 1
christs 1
sake 1
dont 1
get 1
back 1
into 1
your 1
chair 1
said 1
holmes 1
sternly 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
cringe 1
and 1
crawl 1
now 1
but 1
you 1
thought 1
little 1
enough 1
of 1
this 1
poor 1
horner 1
in 1
the 1
dock 1
for 1
a 1
crime 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
i 1
will 1
fly 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
will 1
leave 1
the 1
country 1
sir 1
then 1
the 1
charge 1
against 1
him 1
will 1
break 1
down 1
hum 1
we 1
will 1
talk 1
about 1
that 1
and 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
a 1
true 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
act 1
how 1
came 1
the 1
stone 1
into 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
how 1
came 1
the 1
goose 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
market 1
tell 1
us 1
the 1
truth 1
for 1
there 1
lies 1
your 1
only 1
hope 1
of 1
safety 1
ryder 1
passed 1
his 1
tongue 1
over 1
his 1
parched 1
lips 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
sir 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
horner 1
had 1
been 1
arrested 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
stone 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
what 1
moment 1
the 1
police 1
might 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
into 1
their 1
heads 1
to 1
search 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
room 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
place 1
about 1
the 1
hotel 1
where 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safe 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
on 1
some 1
commission 1
and 1
i 1
made 1
for 1
my 1
sisters 1
house 1
she 1
had 1
married 1
a 1
man 1
named 1
oakshott 1
and 1
lived 1
in 1
brixton 1
road 1
where 1
she 1
fattened 1
fowls 1
for 1
the 1
market 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
there 1
every 1
man 1
i 1
met 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
policeman 1
or 1
a 1
detective 1
and 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
the 1
sweat 1
was 1
pouring 1
down 1
my 1
face 1
before 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
brixton 1
road 1
my 1
sister 1
asked 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
why 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
pale 1
but 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
upset 1
by 1
the 1
jewel 1
robbery 1
at 1
the 1
hotel 1
then 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
back 1
yard 1
and 1
smoked 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
wondered 1
what 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
once 1
called 1
maudsley 1
who 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bad 1
and 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
serving 1
his 1
time 1
in 1
pentonville 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
me 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
ways 1
of 1
thieves 1
and 1
how 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
stole 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
i 1
knew 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
things 1
about 1
him 1
so 1
i 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
kilburn 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
into 1
my 1
confidence 1
he 1
would 1
show 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
stone 1
into 1
money 1
but 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
safety 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
agonies 1
i 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
in 1
coming 1
from 1
the 1
hotel 1
i 1
might 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
be 1
seized 1
and 1
searched 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
stone 1
in 1
my 1
waistcoat 1
pocket 1
i 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
geese 1
which 1
were 1
waddling 1
about 1
round 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
suddenly 1
an 1
idea 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
head 1
which 1
showed 1
me 1
how 1
i 1
could 1
beat 1
the 1
best 1
detective 1
that 1
ever 1
lived 1
my 1
sister 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
some 1
weeks 1
before 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
the 1
pick 1
of 1
her 1
geese 1
for 1
a 1
christmas 1
present 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
her 1
word 1
i 1
would 1
take 1
my 1
goose 1
now 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
would 1
carry 1
my 1
stone 1
to 1
kilburn 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
shed 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
behind 1
this 1
i 1
drove 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
birdsa 1
fine 1
big 1
one 1
white 1
with 1
a 1
barred 1
tail 1
i 1
caught 1
it 1
and 1
prying 1
its 1
bill 1
open 1
i 1
thrust 1
the 1
stone 1
down 1
its 1
throat 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
my 1
finger 1
could 1
reach 1
the 1
bird 1
gave 1
a 1
gulp 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
stone 1
pass 1
along 1
its 1
gullet 1
and 1
down 1
into 1
its 1
crop 1
but 1
the 1
creature 1
flapped 1
and 1
struggled 1
and 1
out 1
came 1
my 1
sister 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
as 1
i 1
turned 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
brute 1
broke 1
loose 1
and 1
fluttered 1
off 1
among 1
the 1
others 1
whatever 1
were 1
you 1
doing 1
with 1
that 1
bird 1
jem 1
says 1
she 1
well 1
said 1
i 1
you 1
said 1
youd 1
give 1
me 1
one 1
for 1
christmas 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
feeling 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
fattest 1

same 1
to 1
you 1
id 1

that 1
one 1

other 1

a 1
good 1
three 1
pound 1
heavier 1

she 1
and 1
we 1
fattened 1

expressly 1
for 1
you 1
never 1
mind 1

the 1
other 1

she 1
a 1
little 1
huffed 1
which 1

that 1
white 1
one 1

the 1
barred 1

in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1

well 1

take 1
it 1
with 1

well 1
i 1

what 1
she 1
said 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
carried 1
the 1
bird 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
kilburn 1
i 1
told 1
my 1
pal 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
done 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
to 1
he 1
laughed 1
until 1
he 1
choked 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
goose 1
my 1
heart 1
turned 1
to 1
water 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
some 1
terrible 1
mistake 1
had 1
occurred 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
bird 1
rushed 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
sisters 1
and 1
hurried 1
into 1
the 1
back 1
yard 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
bird 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
there 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
all 1
maggie 1
i 1
cried 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
dealers 1
jem 1
which 1
dealers 1
breckinridge 1
of 1
covent 1
garden 1
but 1
was 1
there 1
another 1
with 1
a 1
barred 1
tail 1
i 1
asked 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
i 1
chose 1
yes 1
jem 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
barredtailed 1
ones 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
tell 1
them 1
apart 1
well 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
i 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
my 1
feet 1
would 1
carry 1
me 1
to 1
this 1
man 1
breckinridge 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
sold 1
the 1
lot 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
not 1
one 1
word 1
would 1
he 1
tell 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
you 1
heard 1
him 1
yourselves 1
tonight 1
well 1
he 1
has 1
always 1
answered 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
my 1
sister 1
thinks 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
mad 1
sometimes 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
myself 1
and 1
nowand 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
myself 1
a 1
branded 1
thief 1
without 1
ever 1
having 1
touched 1
the 1
wealth 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
sold 1
my 1
character 1
god 1
help 1
me 1
god 1
help 1
me 1
he 1
burst 1
into 1
convulsive 1
sobbing 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
buried 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
his 1
heavy 1
breathing 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
measured 1
tapping 1
of 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
fingertips 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
then 1
my 1
friend 1
rose 1
and 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
get 1
out 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
sir 1
oh 1
heaven 1
bless 1
you 1
no 1
more 1
words 1
get 1
out 1
and 1
no 1
more 1
words 1
were 1
needed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
a 1
clatter 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
bang 1
of 1
a 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
crisp 1
rattle 1
of 1
running 1
footfalls 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
after 1
all 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
reaching 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
for 1
his 1
clay 1
pipe 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
retained 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
to 1
supply 1
their 1
deficiencies 1
if 1
horner 1
were 1
in 1
danger 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
another 1
thing 1
but 1
this 1
fellow 1
will 1
not 1
appear 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
case 1
must 1
collapse 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
commuting 1
a 1
felony 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
saving 1
a 1
soul 1
this 1
fellow 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
wrong 1
again 1
he 1
is 1
too 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
send 1
him 1
to 1
gaol 1
now 1
and 1
you 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
gaolbird 1
for 1
life 1
besides 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
season 1
of 1
forgiveness 1
chance 1
has 1
put 1
in 1
our 1
way 1
a 1
most 1
singular 1
and 1
whimsical 1
problem 1
and 1
its 1
solution 1
is 1
its 1
own 1
reward 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
touch 1
the 1
bell 1
doctor 1
we 1
will 1
begin 1
another 1
investigation 1
in 1
which 1
also 1
a 1
bird 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
chief 1
feature 1
viii 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
speckled 1
band 1
on 1
glancing 1
over 1
my 1
notes 1
of 1
the 1
seventy 1
odd 1
cases 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
eight 1
years 1
studied 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
i 1
find 1
many 1
tragic 1
some 1
comic 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
merely 1
strange 1
but 1
none 1
commonplace 1
for 1
working 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
rather 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
his 1
art 1
than 1
for 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
wealth 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
associate 1
himself 1
with 1
any 1
investigation 1
which 1
did 1
not 1
tend 1
towards 1
the 1
unusual 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
fantastic 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
varied 1
cases 1
however 1
i 1
cannot 1
recall 1
any 1
which 1
presented 1
more 1
singular 1
features 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
wellknown 1
surrey 1
family 1
of 1
the 1
roylotts 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
the 1
events 1
in 1
question 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
association 1
with 1
holmes 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
sharing 1
rooms 1
as 1
bachelors 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
placed 1
them 1
upon 1
record 1
before 1
but 1
a 1
promise 1
of 1
secrecy 1
was 1
made 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
freed 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
month 1
by 1
the 1
untimely 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
pledge 1
was 1
given 1
it 1
is 1
perhaps 1
as 1
well 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
should 1
now 1
come 1
to 1
light 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
reasons 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
widespread 1
rumours 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
dr 1
grimesby 1

which 1
tend 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
matter 1
even 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
the 1
truth 1
it 1
was 1
early 1
in 1
april 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
83 1
that 1
i 1
woke 1
one 1
morning 1
to 1
find 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
standing 1
fully 1
dressed 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
my 1
bed 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
late 1
riser 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
on 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
quarterpast 1
seven 1
i 1
blinked 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
surprise 1
and 1
perhaps 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
resentment 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
myself 1
regular 1
in 1
my 1
habits 1
very 1
sorry 1
to 1
knock 1
you 1
up 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
its 1
the 1
common 1
lot 1
this 1
morning 1
mrs 1
hudson 1
has 1
been 1
knocked 1
up 1
she 1
retorted 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
on 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
thena 1
fire 1
no 1
a 1
client 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
has 1
arrived 1
in 1
a 1
considerable 1
state 1
of 1
excitement 1
who 1
insists 1
upon 1
seeing 1
me 1
she 1
is 1
waiting 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
now 1
when 1
young 1
ladies 1
wander 1
about 1
the 1
metropolis 1
at 1
this 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
knock 1
sleepy 1
people 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
i 1
presume 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
something 1
very 1
pressing 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
communicate 1
should 1
it 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
interesting 1
case 1
you 1
would 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
wish 1
to 1
follow 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
outset 1
i 1
thought 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
call 1
you 1
and 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
chance 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
miss 1
it 1
for 1
anything 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
keener 1
pleasure 1
than 1
in 1
following 1
holmes 1
in 1
his 1
professional 1
investigations 1
and 1
in 1
admiring 1
the 1
rapid 1
deductions 1
as 1
swift 1
as 1
intuitions 1
and 1
yet 1
always 1
founded 1
on 1
a 1
logical 1
basis 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
unravelled 1
the 1
problems 1
which 1
were 1
submitted 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
rapidly 1
threw 1
on 1
my 1
clothes 1
and 1
was 1
ready 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
to 1
accompany 1
my 1
friend 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
a 1
lady 1
dressed 1
in 1
black 1
and 1
heavily 1
veiled 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
rose 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
goodmorning 1
madam 1
said 1
holmes 1
cheerily 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
intimate 1
friend 1
and 1
associate 1
dr 1
watson 1
before 1
whom 1
you 1
can 1
speak 1
as 1
freely 1
as 1
before 1
myself 1
ha 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
mrs 1
hudson 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
good 1
sense 1
to 1
light 1
the 1
fire 1
pray 1
draw 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
order 1
you 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
hot 1
coffee 1
for 1
i 1
observe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
shivering 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
cold 1
which 1
makes 1
me 1
shiver 1
said 1
the 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
changing 1
her 1
seat 1
as 1
requested 1
what 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
fear 1
mr 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
terror 1
she 1
raised 1
her 1
veil 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
indeed 1
in 1
a 1
pitiable 1
state 1
of 1
agitation 1
her 1
face 1
all 1
drawn 1
and 1
grey 1
with 1
restless 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
some 1
hunted 1
animal 1
her 1
features 1
and 1
figure 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
thirty 1
but 1
her 1
hair 1
was 1
shot 1
with 1
premature 1
grey 1
and 1
her 1
expression 1
was 1
weary 1
and 1
haggard 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
ran 1
her 1
over 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
quick 1
allcomprehensive 1
glances 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
fear 1
said 1
he 1
soothingly 1
bending 1
forward 1
and 1
patting 1
her 1
forearm 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
set 1
matters 1
right 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
in 1
by 1
train 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
then 1
no 1
but 1
i 1
observe 1
the 1
second 1
half 1
of 1
a 1
return 1
ticket 1
in 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
your 1
left 1
glove 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
started 1
early 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
drive 1
in 1
a 1
dogcart 1
along 1
heavy 1
roads 1
before 1
you 1
reached 1
the 1
station 1
the 1
lady 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
stared 1
in 1
bewilderment 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
mystery 1
my 1
dear 1
madam 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
the 1
left 1
arm 1
of 1
your 1
jacket 1
is 1
spattered 1
with 1
mud 1
in 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
seven 1
places 1
the 1
marks 1
are 1
perfectly 1
fresh 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
vehicle 1
save 1
a 1
dogcart 1
which 1
throws 1
up 1
mud 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
only 1
when 1
you 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
lefthand 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
driver 1
whatever 1
your 1
reasons 1
may 1
be 1
you 1
are 1
perfectly 1
correct 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
home 1
before 1
six 1
reached 1
leatherhead 1
at 1
twenty 1
past 1
and 1
came 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
train 1
to 1
waterloo 1
sir 1
i 1
can 1
stand 1
this 1
strain 1
no 1
longer 1
i 1
shall 1
go 1
mad 1
if 1
it 1
continues 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
turn 1
tonone 1
save 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
cares 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
poor 1
fellow 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
little 1
aid 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
from 1
mrs 1
farintosh 1
whom 1
you 1
helped 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
her 1
sore 1
need 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
her 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
your 1
address 1
oh 1
sir 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
help 1
me 1
too 1
and 1
at 1
least 1
throw 1
a 1
little 1
light 1
through 1
the 1
dense 1
darkness 1
which 1
surrounds 1
me 1
at 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
services 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
month 1
or 1
six 1
weeks 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
married 1
with 1
the 1
control 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
income 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
me 1
ungrateful 1
holmes 1
turned 1
to 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
unlocking 1
it 1
drew 1
out 1
a 1
small 1
casebook 1
which 1
he 1
consulted 1
farintosh 1
said 1
he 1
ah 1
yes 1
i 1
recall 1
the 1
case 1
it 1
was 1
concerned 1
with 1
an 1
opal 1
tiara 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
before 1
your 1
time 1
watson 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
say 1
madam 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
devote 1
the 1
same 1
care 1
to 1
your 1
case 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
your 1
friend 1
as 1
to 1
reward 1
my 1
profession 1
is 1
its 1
own 1
reward 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
liberty 1
to 1
defray 1
whatever 1
expenses 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
which 1
suits 1
you 1
best 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
lay 1
before 1
us 1
everything 1
that 1
may 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
forming 1
an 1
opinion 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
alas 1
replied 1
our 1
visitor 1
the 1
very 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
situation 1
lies 1
in 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
my 1
fears 1
are 1
so 1
vague 1
and 1
my 1
suspicions 1
depend 1
so 1
entirely 1
upon 1
small 1
points 1
which 1
might 1
seem 1
trivial 1
to 1
another 1
that 1
even 1
he 1
to 1
whom 1
of 1
all 1
others 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
advice 1
looks 1
upon 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
fancies 1
of 1
a 1
nervous 1
woman 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
read 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
soothing 1
answers 1
and 1
averted 1
eyes 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
mr 1
holmes 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
deeply 1
into 1
the 1
manifold 1
wickedness 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
heart 1
you 1
may 1
advise 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
walk 1
amid 1
the 1
dangers 1
which 1
encompass 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
all 1
attention 1
madam 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
helen 1
stoner 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
living 1
with 1
my 1
stepfather 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
survivor 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
oldest 1
saxon 1
families 1
in 1
england 1
the 1
roylotts 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
on 1
the 1
western 1
border 1
of 1
surrey 1
holmes 1
nodded 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
family 1
was 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
among 1
the 1
richest 1
in 1
england 1
and 1
the 1
estates 1
extended 1
over 1
the 1
borders 1
into 1
berkshire 1
in 1
the 1
north 1
and 1
hampshire 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
century 1
however 1
four 1
successive 1
heirs 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
dissolute 1
and 1
wasteful 1
disposition 1
and 1
the 1
family 1
ruin 1
was 1
eventually 1
completed 1
by 1
a 1
gambler 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
regency 1
nothing 1
was 1
left 1
save 1
a 1
few 1
acres 1
of 1
ground 1
and 1
the 1
twohundredyearold 1
house 1
which 1
is 1
itself 1
crushed 1
under 1
a 1
heavy 1
mortgage 1
the 1
last 1
squire 1
dragged 1
out 1
his 1
existence 1
there 1
living 1
the 1
horrible 1
life 1
of 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
pauper 1
but 1
his 1
only 1
son 1
my 1
stepfather 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
adapt 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
new 1
conditions 1
obtained 1
an 1
advance 1
from 1
a 1
relative 1
which 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
medical 1
degree 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
calcutta 1
where 1
by 1
his 1
professional 1
skill 1
and 1
his 1
force 1
of 1
character 1
he 1
established 1
a 1
large 1
practice 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
anger 1
however 1
caused 1
by 1
some 1
robberies 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
perpetrated 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
beat 1
his 1
native 1
butler 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
narrowly 1
escaped 1
a 1
capital 1
sentence 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
suffered 1
a 1
long 1
term 1
of 1
imprisonment 1
and 1
afterwards 1
returned 1
to 1
england 1
a 1
morose 1
and 1
disappointed 1
man 1
when 1
dr 1
roylott 1
was 1
in 1
india 1
he 1
married 1
my 1
mother 1
mrs 1
stoner 1
the 1
young 1
widow 1
of 1
majorgeneral 1
stoner 1
of 1
the 1
bengal 1
artillery 1
my 1
sister 1
julia 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
twins 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
only 1
two 1
years 1
old 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
mothers 1
remarriage 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
of 1
moneynot 1
less 1
than 1
1000 1
pounds 1
a 1
yearand 1
this 1
she 1
bequeathed 1
to 1
dr 1
roylott 1
entirely 1
while 1
we 1
resided 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
provision 1
that 1
a 1
certain 1
annual 1
sum 1
should 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
event 1
of 1
our 1
marriage 1
shortly 1
after 1
our 1
return 1
to 1
england 1
my 1
mother 1
diedshe 1
was 1
killed 1
eight 1
years 1
ago 1
in 1
a 1
railway 1
accident 1
near 1
crewe 1
dr 1
roylott 1
then 1
abandoned 1
his 1
attempts 1
to 1
establish 1
himself 1
in 1
practice 1
in 1
london 1
and 1
took 1
us 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
ancestral 1
house 1
at 1
stoke 1
moran 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
left 1
was 1
enough 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
wants 1
and 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
obstacle 1
to 1
our 1
happiness 1
but 1
a 1
terrible 1
change 1
came 1
over 1
our 1
stepfather 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
instead 1
of 1
making 1
friends 1
and 1
exchanging 1
visits 1
with 1
our 1
neighbours 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
been 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
roylott 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
family 1
seat 1
he 1
shut 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
seldom 1
came 1
out 1
save 1
to 1
indulge 1
in 1
ferocious 1
quarrels 1
with 1
whoever 1
might 1
cross 1
his 1
path 1
violence 1
of 1
temper 1
approaching 1
to 1
mania 1
has 1
been 1
hereditary 1
in 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
stepfathers 1
case 1
it 1
had 1
i 1
believe 1
been 1
intensified 1
by 1
his 1
long 1
residence 1
in 1
the 1
tropics 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
disgraceful 1
brawls 1
took 1
place 1
two 1
of 1
which 1
ended 1
in 1
the 1
policecourt 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
became 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
folks 1
would 1
fly 1
at 1
his 1
approach 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
immense 1
strength 1
and 1
absolutely 1
uncontrollable 1
in 1
his 1
anger 1
last 1
week 1
he 1
hurled 1
the 1
local 1
blacksmith 1
over 1
a 1
parapet 1
into 1
a 1
stream 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
by 1
paying 1
over 1
all 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
gather 1
together 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
avert 1
another 1
public 1
exposure 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
friends 1
at 1
all 1
save 1
the 1
wandering 1
gipsies 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
these 1
vagabonds 1
leave 1
to 1
encamp 1
upon 1
the 1
few 1
acres 1
of 1
bramblecovered 1
land 1
which 1
represent 1
the 1
family 1
estate 1
and 1
would 1
accept 1
in 1
return 1
the 1
hospitality 1
of 1
their 1
tents 1
wandering 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
sometimes 1
for 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
passion 1
also 1
for 1
indian 1
animals 1
which 1
are 1
sent 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
correspondent 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
which 1
wander 1
freely 1
over 1
his 1
grounds 1
and 1
are 1
feared 1
by 1
the 1
villagers 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
their 1
master 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
sister 1
julia 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
great 1
pleasure 1
in 1
our 1
lives 1
no 1
servant 1
would 1
stay 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
we 1
did 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
she 1
was 1
but 1
thirty 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
her 1
death 1
and 1
yet 1
her 1
hair 1
had 1
already 1
begun 1
to 1
whiten 1
even 1
as 1
mine 1
has 1
your 1
sister 1
is 1
dead 1
then 1
she 1
died 1
just 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
her 1
death 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
living 1
the 1
life 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
described 1
we 1
were 1
little 1
likely 1
to 1
see 1
anyone 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
age 1
and 1
position 1
we 1
had 1
however 1
an 1
aunt 1
my 1
mothers 1
maiden 1
sister 1
miss 1
honoria 1
westphail 1
who 1
lives 1
near 1
harrow 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
occasionally 1
allowed 1
to 1
pay 1
short 1
visits 1
at 1
this 1
ladys 1
house 1
julia 1
went 1
there 1
at 1
christmas 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
met 1
there 1
a 1
halfpay 1
major 1
of 1
marines 1
to 1
whom 1
she 1
became 1
engaged 1
my 1
stepfather 1
learned 1
of 1
the 1
engagement 1
when 1
my 1
sister 1
returned 1
and 1
offered 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
the 1
marriage 1
but 1
within 1
a 1
fortnight 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
wedding 1
the 1
terrible 1
event 1
occurred 1
which 1
has 1
deprived 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
only 1
companion 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
been 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
in 1
a 1
cushion 1
but 1
he 1
half 1
opened 1
his 1
lids 1
now 1
and 1
glanced 1
across 1
at 1
his 1
visitor 1
pray 1
be 1
precise 1
as 1
to 1
details 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
for 1
every 1
event 1
of 1
that 1
dreadful 1
time 1
is 1
seared 1
into 1
my 1
memory 1
the 1
manorhouse 1
is 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
said 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
only 1
one 1
wing 1
is 1
now 1
inhabited 1
the 1
bedrooms 1
in 1
this 1
wing 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
the 1
sittingrooms 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
central 1
block 1
of 1
the 1
buildings 1
of 1
these 1
bedrooms 1
the 1
first 1
is 1
dr 1
roylotts 1
the 1
second 1
my 1
sisters 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
my 1
own 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
communication 1
between 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
all 1
open 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
corridor 1
do 1
i 1
make 1
myself 1
plain 1
perfectly 1
so 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
rooms 1
open 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
lawn 1
that 1
fatal 1
night 1
dr 1
roylott 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
early 1
though 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
my 1
sister 1
was 1
troubled 1
by 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
strong 1
indian 1
cigars 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
to 1
smoke 1
she 1
left 1
her 1
room 1
therefore 1
and 1
came 1
into 1
mine 1
where 1
she 1
sat 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
chatting 1
about 1
her 1
approaching 1
wedding 1
at 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
she 1
rose 1
to 1
leave 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
paused 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
tell 1
me 1
helen 1
said 1
she 1
have 1
you 1
ever 1
heard 1
anyone 1
whistle 1
in 1
the 1
dead 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
never 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
whistle 1
yourself 1
in 1
your 1
sleep 1
certainly 1
not 1
but 1
why 1
because 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
nights 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
about 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
heard 1
a 1
low 1
clear 1
whistle 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
light 1
sleeper 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
awakened 1
me 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
where 1
it 1
came 1
fromperhaps 1
from 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
perhaps 1
from 1
the 1
lawn 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
just 1
ask 1
you 1
whether 1
you 1
had 1
heard 1
it 1
no 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
those 1
wretched 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
very 1
likely 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
lawn 1
i 1
wonder 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
it 1
also 1
ah 1
but 1
i 1
sleep 1
more 1
heavily 1
than 1
you 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
great 1
consequence 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
she 1
smiled 1
back 1
at 1
me 1
closed 1
my 1
door 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
i 1
heard 1
her 1
key 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
indeed 1
said 1
holmes 1
was 1
it 1
your 1
custom 1
always 1
to 1
lock 1
yourselves 1
in 1
at 1
night 1
always 1
and 1
why 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
mentioned 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
kept 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
feeling 1
of 1
security 1
unless 1
our 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
quite 1
so 1
pray 1
proceed 1
with 1
your 1
statement 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
that 1
night 1
a 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
impending 1
misfortune 1
impressed 1
me 1
my 1
sister 1
and 1
i 1
you 1
will 1
recollect 1
were 1
twins 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
subtle 1
are 1
the 1
links 1
which 1
bind 1
two 1
souls 1
which 1
are 1
so 1
closely 1
allied 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
night 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
howling 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
beating 1
and 1
splashing 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
suddenly 1
amid 1
all 1
the 1
hubbub 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
there 1
burst 1
forth 1
the 1
wild 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
terrified 1
woman 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
sisters 1
voice 1
i 1
sprang 1
from 1
my 1
bed 1
wrapped 1
a 1
shawl 1
round 1
me 1
and 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
corridor 1
as 1
i 1
opened 1
my 1
door 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
hear 1
a 1
low 1
whistle 1
such 1
as 1
my 1
sister 1
described 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
a 1
clanging 1
sound 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
metal 1
had 1
fallen 1
as 1
i 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
my 1
sisters 1
door 1
was 1
unlocked 1
and 1
revolved 1
slowly 1
upon 1
its 1
hinges 1
i 1
stared 1
at 1
it 1
horrorstricken 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
issue 1
from 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
corridorlamp 1
i 1
saw 1
my 1
sister 1
appear 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
her 1
face 1
blanched 1
with 1
terror 1
her 1
hands 1
groping 1
for 1
help 1
her 1
whole 1
figure 1
swaying 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
drunkard 1
i 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
threw 1
my 1
arms 1
round 1
her 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
her 1
knees 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
she 1
writhed 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
terrible 1
pain 1
and 1
her 1
limbs 1
were 1
dreadfully 1
convulsed 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
recognised 1
me 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
she 1
suddenly 1
shrieked 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
oh 1
my 1
god 1
helen 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
band 1
the 1
speckled 1
band 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
else 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
fain 1
have 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
stabbed 1
with 1
her 1
finger 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
doctors 1
room 1
but 1
a 1
fresh 1
convulsion 1
seized 1
her 1
and 1
choked 1
her 1
words 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
calling 1
loudly 1
for 1
my 1
stepfather 1
and 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
hastening 1
from 1
his 1
room 1
in 1
his 1
dressinggown 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
my 1
sisters 1
side 1
she 1
was 1
unconscious 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
poured 1
brandy 1
down 1
her 1
throat 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
medical 1
aid 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
all 1
efforts 1
were 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
she 1
slowly 1
sank 1
and 1
died 1
without 1
having 1
recovered 1
her 1
consciousness 1
such 1
was 1
the 1
dreadful 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
one 1
moment 1
said 1
holmes 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
about 1
this 1
whistle 1
and 1
metallic 1
sound 1
could 1
you 1
swear 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
the 1
county 1
coroner 1
asked 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
inquiry 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
strong 1
impression 1
that 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
among 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
and 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
house 1
i 1
may 1
possibly 1
have 1
been 1
deceived 1
was 1
your 1
sister 1
dressed 1
no 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
nightdress 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
was 1
found 1
the 1
charred 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
match 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
left 1
a 1
matchbox 1
showing 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
struck 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
her 1
when 1
the 1
alarm 1
took 1
place 1
that 1
is 1
important 1
and 1
what 1
conclusions 1
did 1
the 1
coroner 1
come 1
to 1
he 1
investigated 1
the 1
case 1
with 1
great 1
care 1
for 1
dr 1
roylotts 1
conduct 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
notorious 1
in 1
the 1
county 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
find 1
any 1
satisfactory 1
cause 1
of 1
death 1
my 1
evidence 1
showed 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
fastened 1
upon 1
the 1
inner 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
blocked 1
by 1
oldfashioned 1
shutters 1
with 1
broad 1
iron 1
bars 1
which 1
were 1
secured 1
every 1
night 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
carefully 1
sounded 1
and 1
were 1
shown 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
solid 1
all 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
flooring 1
was 1
also 1
thoroughly 1
examined 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
result 1
the 1
chimney 1
is 1
wide 1
but 1
is 1
barred 1
up 1
by 1
four 1
large 1
staples 1
it 1
is 1
certain 1
therefore 1
that 1
my 1
sister 1
was 1
quite 1
alone 1
when 1
she 1
met 1
her 1
end 1
besides 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
marks 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
upon 1
her 1
how 1
about 1
poison 1
the 1
doctors 1
examined 1
her 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
lady 1
died 1
of 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
of 1
pure 1
fear 1
and 1
nervous 1
shock 1
though 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
frightened 1
her 1
i 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
were 1
there 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
yes 1
there 1
are 1
nearly 1
always 1
some 1
there 1
ah 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
this 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
banda 1
speckled 1
band 1
sometimes 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
wild 1
talk 1
of 1
delirium 1
sometimes 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
referred 1
to 1
some 1
band 1
of 1
people 1
perhaps 1
to 1
these 1
very 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
the 1
spotted 1
handkerchiefs 1
which 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
wear 1
over 1
their 1
heads 1
might 1
have 1
suggested 1
the 1
strange 1
adjective 1
which 1
she 1
used 1
holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
satisfied 1
these 1
are 1
very 1
deep 1
waters 1
said 1
he 1
pray 1
go 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
narrative 1
two 1
years 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
and 1
my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
until 1
lately 1
lonelier 1
than 1
ever 1
a 1
month 1
ago 1
however 1
a 1
dear 1
friend 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
has 1
done 1
me 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
ask 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
marriage 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
armitagepercy 1
armitagethe 1
second 1
son 1
of 1
mr 1
armitage 1
of 1
crane 1
water 1
near 1
reading 1
my 1
stepfather 1
has 1
offered 1
no 1
opposition 1
to 1
the 1
match 1
and 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
two 1
days 1
ago 1
some 1
repairs 1
were 1
started 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
wing 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
and 1
my 1
bedroom 1
wall 1
has 1
been 1
pierced 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
move 1
into 1
the 1
chamber 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
sister 1
died 1
and 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
bed 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
slept 1
imagine 1
then 1
my 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
when 1
last 1
night 1
as 1
i 1
lay 1
awake 1
thinking 1
over 1
her 1
terrible 1
fate 1
i 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
low 1
whistle 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
herald 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
death 1
i 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
lit 1
the 1
lamp 1
but 1
nothing 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
i 1
was 1
too 1
shaken 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
again 1
however 1
so 1
i 1
dressed 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
daylight 1
i 1
slipped 1
down 1
got 1
a 1
dogcart 1
at 1
the 1
crown 1
inn 1
which 1
is 1
opposite 1
and 1
drove 1
to 1
leatherhead 1
from 1
whence 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
on 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
the 1
one 1
object 1
of 1
seeing 1
you 1
and 1
asking 1
your 1
advice 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
wisely 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
yes 1
all 1
miss 1
roylott 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
you 1
are 1
screening 1
your 1
stepfather 1
why 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
for 1
answer 1
holmes 1
pushed 1
back 1
the 1
frill 1
of 1
black 1
lace 1
which 1
fringed 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
our 1
visitors 1
knee 1
five 1
little 1
livid 1
spots 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
four 1
fingers 1
and 1
a 1
thumb 1
were 1
printed 1
upon 1
the 1
white 1
wrist 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
cruelly 1
used 1
said 1
holmes 1
the 1
lady 1
coloured 1
deeply 1
and 1
covered 1
over 1
her 1
injured 1
wrist 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
hard 1
man 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
perhaps 1
he 1
hardly 1
knows 1
his 1
own 1
strength 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
during 1
which 1
holmes 1
leaned 1
his 1
chin 1
upon 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stared 1
into 1
the 1
crackling 1
fire 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
deep 1
business 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
there 1
are 1
a 1
thousand 1
details 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
desire 1
to 1
know 1
before 1
i 1
decide 1
upon 1
our 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
yet 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
stoke 1
moran 1
today 1
would 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
see 1
over 1
these 1
rooms 1
without 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
your 1
stepfather 1
as 1
it 1
happens 1
he 1
spoke 1
of 1
coming 1
into 1
town 1
today 1
upon 1
some 1
most 1
important 1
business 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
away 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
disturb 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
housekeeper 1
now 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
old 1
and 1
foolish 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
easily 1
get 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
excellent 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
averse 1
to 1
this 1
trip 1
watson 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
then 1
we 1
shall 1
both 1
come 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
yourself 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
things 1
which 1
i 1
would 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
town 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
train 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
your 1
coming 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
expect 1
us 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
i 1
have 1
myself 1
some 1
small 1
business 1
matters 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
will 1
you 1
not 1
wait 1
and 1
breakfast 1
no 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
lightened 1
already 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
confided 1
my 1
trouble 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
shall 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
seeing 1
you 1
again 1
this 1
afternoon 1
she 1
dropped 1
her 1
thick 1
black 1
veil 1
over 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
glided 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
watson 1
asked 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
dark 1
and 1
sinister 1
business 1
dark 1
enough 1
and 1
sinister 1
enough 1
yet 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
correct 1
in 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
flooring 1
and 1
walls 1
are 1
sound 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
window 1
and 1
chimney 1
are 1
impassable 1
then 1
her 1
sister 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
undoubtedly 1
alone 1
when 1
she 1
met 1
her 1
mysterious 1
end 1
what 1
becomes 1
then 1
of 1
these 1
nocturnal 1
whistles 1
and 1
what 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
peculiar 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
woman 1
i 1
cannot 1
think 1
when 1
you 1
combine 1
the 1
ideas 1
of 1
whistles 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
gipsies 1
who 1
are 1
on 1
intimate 1
terms 1
with 1
this 1
old 1
doctor 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
has 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
preventing 1
his 1
stepdaughters 1
marriage 1
the 1
dying 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
band 1
and 1
finally 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
miss 1
helen 1
stoner 1
heard 1
a 1
metallic 1
clang 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
caused 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
metal 1
bars 1
that 1
secured 1
the 1
shutters 1
falling 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
good 1
ground 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
mystery 1
may 1
be 1
cleared 1
along 1
those 1
lines 1
but 1
what 1
then 1
did 1
the 1
gipsies 1
do 1
i 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
i 1
see 1
many 1
objections 1
to 1
any 1
such 1
theory 1
and 1
so 1
do 1
i 1
it 1
is 1
precisely 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
stoke 1
moran 1
this 1
day 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
the 1
objections 1
are 1
fatal 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
explained 1
away 1
but 1
what 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
devil 1
the 1
ejaculation 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
from 1
my 1
companion 1
by 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
our 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
suddenly 1
dashed 1
open 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
huge 1
man 1
had 1
framed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
aperture 1
his 1
costume 1
was 1
a 1
peculiar 1
mixture 1
of 1
the 1
professional 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
agricultural 1
having 1
a 1
black 1
tophat 1
a 1
long 1
frockcoat 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
high 1
gaiters 1
with 1
a 1
huntingcrop 1
swinging 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
so 1
tall 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
his 1
hat 1
actually 1
brushed 1
the 1
cross 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
doorway 1
and 1
his 1
breadth 1
seemed 1
to 1
span 1
it 1
across 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
a 1
large 1
face 1
seared 1
with 1
a 1
thousand 1
wrinkles 1
burned 1
yellow 1
with 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
marked 1
with 1
every 1
evil 1
passion 1
was 1
turned 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
while 1
his 1
deepset 1
bileshot 1
eyes 1
and 1
his 1
high 1
thin 1
fleshless 1
nose 1
gave 1
him 1
somewhat 1
the 1
resemblance 1
to 1
a 1
fierce 1
old 1
bird 1
of 1
prey 1
which 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
holmes 1
asked 1
this 1
apparition 1
my 1
name 1
sir 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
me 1
said 1
my 1
companion 1
quietly 1
i 1
am 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylott 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
indeed 1
doctor 1
said 1
holmes 1
blandly 1
pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
my 1
stepdaughter 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
i 1
have 1
traced 1
her 1
what 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
cold 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
said 1
holmes 1
what 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
screamed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
furiously 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
crocuses 1
promise 1
well 1
continued 1
my 1
companion 1
imperturbably 1
ha 1
you 1
put 1
me 1
off 1
do 1
you 1
said 1
our 1
new 1
visitor 1
taking 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
huntingcrop 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
you 1
scoundrel 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
before 1
you 1
are 1
holmes 1
the 1
meddler 1
my 1
friend 1
smiled 1
holmes 1
the 1
busybody 1
his 1
smile 1
broadened 1
holmes 1
the 1
scotland 1
yard 1
jackinoffice 1
holmes 1
chuckled 1
heartily 1
your 1
conversation 1
is 1
most 1
entertaining 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
you 1
go 1
out 1
close 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
decided 1
draught 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
my 1
say 1
dont 1
you 1
dare 1
to 1
meddle 1
with 1
my 1
affairs 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
miss 1
stoner 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
i 1
traced 1
her 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
dangerous 1
man 1
to 1
fall 1
foul 1
of 1
see 1
here 1
he 1
stepped 1
swiftly 1
forward 1
seized 1
the 1
poker 1
and 1
bent 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
curve 1
with 1
his 1
huge 1
brown 1
hands 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
keep 1
yourself 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
grip 1
he 1
snarled 1
and 1
hurling 1
the 1
twisted 1
poker 1
into 1
the 1
fireplace 1
he 1
strode 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
seems 1
a 1
very 1
amiable 1
person 1
said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
bulky 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
remained 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
shown 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
grip 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
more 1
feeble 1
than 1
his 1
own 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
steel 1
poker 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
effort 1
straightened 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
fancy 1
his 1
having 1
the 1
insolence 1
to 1
confound 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
official 1
detective 1
force 1
this 1
incident 1
gives 1
zest 1
to 1
our 1
investigation 1
however 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
trust 1
that 1
our 1
little 1
friend 1
will 1
not 1
suffer 1
from 1
her 1
imprudence 1
in 1
allowing 1
this 1
brute 1
to 1
trace 1
her 1
and 1
now 1
watson 1
we 1
shall 1
order 1
breakfast 1
and 1
afterwards 1
i 1
shall 1
walk 1
down 1
to 1
doctors 1
commons 1
where 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
data 1
which 1
may 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
one 1
oclock 1
when 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
returned 1
from 1
his 1
excursion 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
blue 1
paper 1
scrawled 1
over 1
with 1
notes 1
and 1
figures 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
determine 1
its 1
exact 1
meaning 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
obliged 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
the 1
present 1
prices 1
of 1
the 1
investments 1
with 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
concerned 1
the 1
total 1
income 1
which 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
wifes 1
death 1
was 1
little 1
short 1
of 1
1100 1
pounds 1
is 1
now 1
through 1
the 1
fall 1
in 1
agricultural 1
prices 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
750 1
pounds 1
each 1
daughter 1
can 1
claim 1
an 1
income 1
of 1
250 1
pounds 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
marriage 1
it 1
is 1
evident 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
both 1
girls 1
had 1
married 1
this 1
beauty 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
mere 1
pittance 1
while 1
even 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
cripple 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
extent 1
my 1
mornings 1
work 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
wasted 1
since 1
it 1
has 1
proved 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
very 1
strongest 1
motives 1
for 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
and 1
now 1
watson 1
this 1
is 1
too 1
serious 1
for 1
dawdling 1
especially 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
is 1
aware 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
interesting 1
ourselves 1
in 1
his 1
affairs 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
we 1
shall 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
drive 1
to 1
waterloo 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
obliged 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
slip 1
your 1
revolver 1
into 1
your 1
pocket 1
an 1
eleys 1
no 1
2 1
is 1
an 1
excellent 1
argument 1
with 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
can 1
twist 1
steel 1
pokers 1
into 1
knots 1
that 1
and 1
a 1
toothbrush 1
are 1
i 1
think 1
all 1
that 1
we 1
need 1
at 1
waterloo 1
we 1
were 1
fortunate 1
in 1
catching 1
a 1
train 1
for 1
leatherhead 1
where 1
we 1
hired 1
a 1
trap 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
inn 1
and 1
drove 1
for 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
miles 1
through 1
the 1
lovely 1
surrey 1
lanes 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
day 1
with 1
a 1
bright 1
sun 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
fleecy 1
clouds 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
wayside 1
hedges 1
were 1
just 1
throwing 1
out 1
their 1
first 1
green 1
shoots 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
pleasant 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
moist 1
earth 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
contrast 1
between 1
the 1
sweet 1
promise 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
this 1
sinister 1
quest 1
upon 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
my 1
companion 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
trap 1
his 1
arms 1
folded 1
his 1
hat 1
pulled 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
his 1
chin 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
thought 1
suddenly 1
however 1
he 1
started 1
tapped 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
pointed 1
over 1
the 1
meadows 1
look 1
there 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
heavily 1
timbered 1
park 1
stretched 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
gentle 1
slope 1
thickening 1
into 1
a 1
grove 1
at 1
the 1
highest 1
point 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
branches 1
there 1
jutted 1
out 1
the 1
grey 1
gables 1
and 1
high 1
rooftree 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
old 1
mansion 1
stoke 1
moran 1
said 1
he 1
yes 1
sir 1
that 1
be 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylott 1
remarked 1
the 1
driver 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
building 1
going 1
on 1
there 1
said 1
holmes 1
that 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
theres 1
the 1
village 1
said 1
the 1
driver 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
cluster 1
of 1
roofs 1
some 1
distance 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
youll 1
find 1
it 1
shorter 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
this 1
stile 1
and 1
so 1
by 1
the 1
footpath 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
there 1
it 1
is 1
where 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
walking 1
and 1
the 1
lady 1
i 1
fancy 1
is 1
miss 1
stoner 1
observed 1
holmes 1
shading 1
his 1
eyes 1
yes 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
suggest 1
we 1
got 1
off 1
paid 1
our 1
fare 1
and 1
the 1
trap 1
rattled 1
back 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
leatherhead 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
climbed 1
the 1
stile 1
that 1
this 1
fellow 1
should 1
think 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
here 1
as 1
architects 1
or 1
on 1
some 1
definite 1
business 1
it 1
may 1
stop 1
his 1
gossip 1
goodafternoon 1
miss 1
stoner 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
word 1
our 1
client 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
had 1
hurried 1
forward 1
to 1
meet 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
which 1
spoke 1
her 1
joy 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
so 1
eagerly 1
for 1
you 1
she 1
cried 1
shaking 1
hands 1
with 1
us 1
warmly 1
all 1
has 1
turned 1
out 1
splendidly 1
dr 1
roylott 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
unlikely 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
evening 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
making 1
the 1
doctors 1
acquaintance 1
said 1
holmes 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
he 1
sketched 1
out 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
miss 1
stoner 1
turned 1
white 1
to 1
the 1
lips 1
as 1
she 1
listened 1
good 1
heavens 1
she 1
cried 1
he 1
has 1
followed 1
me 1
then 1
so 1
it 1
appears 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
cunning 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
know 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
safe 1
from 1
him 1
what 1
will 1
he 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
returns 1
he 1
must 1
guard 1
himself 1
for 1
he 1
may 1
find 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
someone 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
himself 1
upon 1
his 1
track 1
you 1
must 1
lock 1
yourself 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
tonight 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
violent 1
we 1
shall 1
take 1
you 1
away 1
to 1
your 1
aunts 1
at 1
harrow 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
make 1
the 1
best 1
use 1
of 1
our 1
time 1
so 1
kindly 1
take 1
us 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
rooms 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
building 1
was 1
of 1
grey 1
lichenblotched 1
stone 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
central 1
portion 1
and 1
two 1
curving 1
wings 1
like 1
the 1
claws 1
of 1
a 1
crab 1
thrown 1
out 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
wings 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
broken 1
and 1
blocked 1
with 1
wooden 1
boards 1
while 1
the 1
roof 1
was 1
partly 1
caved 1
in 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
ruin 1
the 1
central 1
portion 1
was 1
in 1
little 1
better 1
repair 1
but 1
the 1
righthand 1
block 1
was 1
comparatively 1
modern 1
and 1
the 1
blinds 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
with 1
the 1
blue 1
smoke 1
curling 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
chimneys 1
showed 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
where 1
the 1
family 1
resided 1
some 1
scaffolding 1
had 1
been 1
erected 1
against 1
the 1
end 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
stonework 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
into 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
workmen 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
our 1
visit 1
holmes 1
walked 1
slowly 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
illtrimmed 1
lawn 1
and 1
examined 1
with 1
deep 1
attention 1
the 1
outsides 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
this 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
sleep 1
the 1
centre 1
one 1
to 1
your 1
sisters 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
building 1
to 1
dr 1
roylotts 1
chamber 1
exactly 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
one 1
pending 1
the 1
alterations 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
there 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
very 1
pressing 1
need 1
for 1
repairs 1
at 1
that 1
end 1
wall 1
there 1
were 1
none 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excuse 1
to 1
move 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
room 1
ah 1
that 1
is 1
suggestive 1
now 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
narrow 1
wing 1
runs 1
the 1
corridor 1
from 1
which 1
these 1
three 1
rooms 1
open 1
there 1
are 1
windows 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
yes 1
but 1
very 1
small 1
ones 1
too 1
narrow 1
for 1
anyone 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
as 1
you 1
both 1
locked 1
your 1
doors 1
at 1
night 1
your 1
rooms 1
were 1
unapproachable 1
from 1
that 1
side 1
now 1
would 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
bar 1
your 1
shutters 1
miss 1
stoner 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
holmes 1
after 1
a 1
careful 1
examination 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
endeavoured 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
to 1
force 1
the 1
shutter 1
open 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
slit 1
through 1
which 1
a 1
knife 1
could 1
be 1
passed 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
bar 1
then 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
he 1
tested 1
the 1
hinges 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
of 1
solid 1
iron 1
built 1
firmly 1
into 1
the 1
massive 1
masonry 1
hum 1
said 1
he 1
scratching 1
his 1
chin 1
in 1
some 1
perplexity 1
my 1
theory 1
certainly 1
presents 1
some 1
difficulties 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
pass 1
these 1
shutters 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
bolted 1
well 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
inside 1
throws 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
a 1
small 1
side 1
door 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
whitewashed 1
corridor 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
three 1
bedrooms 1
opened 1
holmes 1
refused 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
third 1
chamber 1
so 1
we 1
passed 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
second 1
that 1
in 1
which 1
miss 1
stoner 1
was 1
now 1
sleeping 1
and 1
in 1
which 1
her 1
sister 1
had 1
met 1
with 1
her 1
fate 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
homely 1
little 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
low 1
ceiling 1
and 1
a 1
gaping 1
fireplace 1
after 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
old 1
countryhouses 1
a 1
brown 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
stood 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
a 1
narrow 1
whitecounterpaned 1
bed 1
in 1
another 1
and 1
a 1
dressingtable 1
on 1
the 1
lefthand 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
these 1
articles 1
with 1
two 1
small 1
wickerwork 1
chairs 1
made 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
save 1
for 1
a 1
square 1
of 1
wilton 1
carpet 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
the 1
boards 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
panelling 1
of 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
brown 1
wormeaten 1
oak 1
so 1
old 1
and 1
discoloured 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
dated 1
from 1
the 1
original 1
building 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
holmes 1
drew 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chairs 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
sat 1
silent 1
while 1
his 1
eyes 1
travelled 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
and 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
taking 1
in 1
every 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
apartment 1
where 1
does 1
that 1
bell 1
communicate 1
with 1
he 1
asked 1
at 1
last 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
thick 1
bellrope 1
which 1
hung 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
tassel 1
actually 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
pillow 1
it 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
housekeepers 1
room 1
it 1
looks 1
newer 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
put 1
there 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
ago 1
your 1
sister 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
suppose 1
no 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
using 1
it 1
we 1
used 1
always 1
to 1
get 1
what 1
we 1
wanted 1
for 1
ourselves 1
indeed 1
it 1
seemed 1
unnecessary 1
to 1
put 1
so 1
nice 1
a 1
bellpull 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
while 1
i 1
satisfy 1
myself 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
floor 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
crawled 1
swiftly 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
examining 1
minutely 1
the 1
cracks 1
between 1
the 1
boards 1
then 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
the 1
woodwork 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
chamber 1
was 1
panelled 1
finally 1
he 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
spent 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
staring 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
running 1
his 1
eye 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
wall 1
finally 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
bellrope 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
brisk 1
tug 1
why 1
its 1
a 1
dummy 1
said 1
he 1
wont 1
it 1
ring 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
attached 1
to 1
a 1
wire 1
this 1
is 1
very 1
interesting 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
fastened 1
to 1
a 1
hook 1
just 1
above 1
where 1
the 1
little 1
opening 1
for 1
the 1
ventilator 1
is 1
how 1
very 1
absurd 1
i 1
never 1
noticed 1
that 1
before 1
very 1
strange 1
muttered 1
holmes 1
pulling 1
at 1
the 1
rope 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
very 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
this 1
room 1
for 1
example 1
what 1
a 1
fool 1
a 1
builder 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
open 1
a 1
ventilator 1
into 1
another 1
room 1
when 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
trouble 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
communicated 1
with 1
the 1
outside 1
air 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
quite 1
modern 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
done 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
the 1
bellrope 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
yes 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
little 1
changes 1
carried 1
out 1
about 1
that 1
time 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
characterdummy 1
bellropes 1
and 1
ventilators 1
which 1
do 1
not 1
ventilate 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
miss 1
stoner 1
we 1
shall 1
now 1
carry 1
our 1
researches 1
into 1
the 1
inner 1
apartment 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylotts 1
chamber 1
was 1
larger 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
stepdaughter 1
but 1
was 1
as 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
a 1
campbed 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
shelf 1
full 1
of 1
books 1
mostly 1
of 1
a 1
technical 1
character 1
an 1
armchair 1
beside 1
the 1
bed 1
a 1
plain 1
wooden 1
chair 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
a 1
round 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
safe 1
were 1
the 1
principal 1
things 1
which 1
met 1
the 1
eye 1
holmes 1
walked 1
slowly 1
round 1
and 1
examined 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
keenest 1
interest 1
whats 1
in 1
here 1
he 1
asked 1
tapping 1
the 1
safe 1
my 1
stepfathers 1
business 1
papers 1
oh 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
inside 1
then 1
only 1
once 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
i 1
remember 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
papers 1
there 1
isnt 1
a 1
cat 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
example 1
no 1
what 1
a 1
strange 1
idea 1
well 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
a 1
small 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
which 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
no 1
we 1
dont 1
keep 1
a 1
cat 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
ah 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
well 1
a 1
cheetah 1
is 1
just 1
a 1
big 1
cat 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
does 1
not 1
go 1
very 1
far 1
in 1
satisfying 1
its 1
wants 1
i 1
daresay 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
point 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
determine 1
he 1
squatted 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
wooden 1
chair 1
and 1
examined 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
thank 1
you 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
settled 1
said 1
he 1
rising 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
lens 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
hullo 1
here 1
is 1
something 1
interesting 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
had 1
caught 1
his 1
eye 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
dog 1
lash 1
hung 1
on 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
lash 1
however 1
was 1
curled 1
upon 1
itself 1
and 1
tied 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
loop 1
of 1
whipcord 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
watson 1
its 1
a 1
common 1
enough 1
lash 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
why 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
tied 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
common 1
is 1
it 1
ah 1
me 1
its 1
a 1
wicked 1
world 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
clever 1
man 1
turns 1
his 1
brains 1
to 1
crime 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
all 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
enough 1
now 1
miss 1
stoner 1
and 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
we 1
shall 1
walk 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
lawn 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
my 1
friends 1
face 1
so 1
grim 1
or 1
his 1
brow 1
so 1
dark 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
when 1
we 1
turned 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
this 1
investigation 1
we 1
had 1
walked 1
several 1
times 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
lawn 1
neither 1
miss 1
stoner 1
nor 1
myself 1
liking 1
to 1
break 1
in 1
upon 1
his 1
thoughts 1
before 1
he 1
roused 1
himself 1
from 1
his 1
reverie 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
essential 1
miss 1
stoner 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
absolutely 1
follow 1
my 1
advice 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
i 1
shall 1
most 1
certainly 1
do 1
so 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
too 1
serious 1
for 1
any 1
hesitation 1
your 1
life 1
may 1
depend 1
upon 1
your 1
compliance 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
your 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
both 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
both 1
miss 1
stoner 1
and 1
i 1
gazed 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
astonishment 1
yes 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
so 1
let 1
me 1
explain 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
village 1
inn 1
over 1
there 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
crown 1
very 1
good 1
your 1
windows 1
would 1
be 1
visible 1
from 1
there 1
certainly 1
you 1
must 1
confine 1
yourself 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
on 1
pretence 1
of 1
a 1
headache 1
when 1
your 1
stepfather 1
comes 1
back 1
then 1
when 1
you 1
hear 1
him 1
retire 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
must 1
open 1
the 1
shutters 1
of 1
your 1
window 1
undo 1
the 1
hasp 1
put 1
your 1
lamp 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
signal 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
then 1
withdraw 1
quietly 1
with 1
everything 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
likely 1
to 1
want 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
occupy 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
repairs 1
you 1
could 1
manage 1
there 1
for 1
one 1
night 1
oh 1
yes 1
easily 1
the 1
rest 1
you 1
will 1
leave 1
in 1
our 1
hands 1
but 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
do 1
we 1
shall 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
investigate 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
noise 1
which 1
has 1
disturbed 1
you 1
i 1
believe 1
mr 1
holmes 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
made 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
said 1
miss 1
stoner 1
laying 1
her 1
hand 1
upon 1
my 1
companions 1
sleeve 1
perhaps 1
i 1
have 1
then 1
for 1
pitys 1
sake 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
sisters 1
death 1
i 1
should 1
prefer 1
to 1
have 1
clearer 1
proofs 1
before 1
i 1
speak 1
you 1
can 1
at 1
least 1
tell 1
me 1
whether 1
my 1
own 1
thought 1
is 1
correct 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
died 1
from 1
some 1
sudden 1
fright 1
no 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
probably 1
some 1
more 1
tangible 1
cause 1
and 1
now 1
miss 1
stoner 1
we 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
for 1
if 1
dr 1
roylott 1
returned 1
and 1
saw 1
us 1
our 1
journey 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
vain 1
goodbye 1
and 1
be 1
brave 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
you 1
may 1
rest 1
assured 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
drive 1
away 1
the 1
dangers 1
that 1
threaten 1
you 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
engaging 1
a 1
bedroom 1
and 1
sittingroom 1
at 1
the 1
crown 1
inn 1
they 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
upper 1
floor 1
and 1
from 1
our 1
window 1
we 1
could 1
command 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
gate 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
inhabited 1
wing 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
manor 1
house 1
at 1
dusk 1
we 1
saw 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylott 1
drive 1
past 1
his 1
huge 1
form 1
looming 1
up 1
beside 1
the 1
little 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
lad 1
who 1
drove 1
him 1
the 1
boy 1
had 1
some 1
slight 1
difficulty 1
in 1
undoing 1
the 1
heavy 1
iron 1
gates 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
hoarse 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
doctors 1
voice 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
fury 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
clinched 1
fists 1
at 1
him 1
the 1
trap 1
drove 1
on 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
sudden 1
light 1
spring 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
the 1
lamp 1
was 1
lit 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sittingrooms 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
gathering 1
darkness 1
i 1
have 1
really 1
some 1
scruples 1
as 1
to 1
taking 1
you 1
tonight 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
element 1
of 1
danger 1
can 1
i 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
your 1
presence 1
might 1
be 1
invaluable 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
come 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
danger 1
you 1
have 1
evidently 1
seen 1
more 1
in 1
these 1
rooms 1
than 1
was 1
visible 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
but 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
deduced 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
i 1
imagine 1
that 1
you 1
saw 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
i 1
saw 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
save 1
the 1
bellrope 1
and 1
what 1
purpose 1
that 1
could 1
answer 1
i 1
confess 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
imagine 1
you 1
saw 1
the 1
ventilator 1
too 1
yes 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
unusual 1
thing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
small 1
opening 1
between 1
two 1
rooms 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
small 1
that 1
a 1
rat 1
could 1
hardly 1
pass 1
through 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
find 1
a 1
ventilator 1
before 1
ever 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
stoke 1
moran 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes 1
oh 1
yes 1
i 1
did 1
you 1
remember 1
in 1
her 1
statement 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
her 1
sister 1
could 1
smell 1
dr 1
roylotts 1
cigar 1
now 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
suggested 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
communication 1
between 1
the 1
two 1
rooms 1
it 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
or 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
remarked 1
upon 1
at 1
the 1
coroners 1
inquiry 1
i 1
deduced 1
a 1
ventilator 1
but 1
what 1
harm 1
can 1
there 1
be 1
in 1
that 1
well 1
there 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
curious 1
coincidence 1
of 1
dates 1
a 1
ventilator 1
is 1
made 1
a 1
cord 1
is 1
hung 1
and 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
sleeps 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
dies 1
does 1
not 1
that 1
strike 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
as 1
yet 1
see 1
any 1
connection 1
did 1
you 1
observe 1
anything 1
very 1
peculiar 1
about 1
that 1
bed 1
no 1
it 1
was 1
clamped 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
did 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
a 1
bed 1
fastened 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
i 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
lady 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
her 1
bed 1
it 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
relative 1
position 1
to 1
the 1
ventilator 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
ropeor 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
since 1
it 1
was 1
clearly 1
never 1
meant 1
for 1
a 1
bellpull 1
holmes 1
i 1
cried 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
see 1
dimly 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
hinting 1
at 1
we 1
are 1
only 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
prevent 1
some 1
subtle 1
and 1
horrible 1
crime 1
subtle 1
enough 1
and 1
horrible 1
enough 1
when 1
a 1
doctor 1
does 1
go 1
wrong 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
criminals 1
he 1
has 1
nerve 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
knowledge 1
palmer 1
and 1
pritchard 1
were 1
among 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
their 1
profession 1
this 1
man 1
strikes 1
even 1
deeper 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
strike 1
deeper 1
still 1
but 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
horrors 1
enough 1
before 1
the 1
night 1
is 1
over 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
a 1
quiet 1
pipe 1
and 1
turn 1
our 1
minds 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
to 1
something 1
more 1
cheerful 1
about 1
nine 1
oclock 1
the 1
light 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
was 1
extinguished 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
dark 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
manor 1
house 1
two 1
hours 1
passed 1
slowly 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
stroke 1
of 1
eleven 1
a 1
single 1
bright 1
light 1
shone 1
out 1
right 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
is 1
our 1
signal 1
said 1
holmes 1
springing 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
middle 1
window 1
as 1
we 1
passed 1
out 1
he 1
exchanged 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
with 1
the 1
landlord 1
explaining 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
going 1
on 1
a 1
late 1
visit 1
to 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
there 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
we 1
were 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
dark 1
road 1
a 1
chill 1
wind 1
blowing 1
in 1
our 1
faces 1
and 1
one 1
yellow 1
light 1
twinkling 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
to 1
guide 1
us 1
on 1
our 1
sombre 1
errand 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
difficulty 1
in 1
entering 1
the 1
grounds 1
for 1
unrepaired 1
breaches 1
gaped 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
park 1
wall 1
making 1
our 1
way 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
lawn 1
crossed 1
it 1
and 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
enter 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
when 1
out 1
from 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
laurel 1
bushes 1
there 1
darted 1
what 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
hideous 1
and 1
distorted 1
child 1
who 1
threw 1
itself 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
with 1
writhing 1
limbs 1
and 1
then 1
ran 1
swiftly 1
across 1
the 1
lawn 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
my 1
god 1
i 1
whispered 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
holmes 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
as 1
startled 1
as 1
i 1
his 1
hand 1
closed 1
like 1
a 1
vice 1
upon 1
my 1
wrist 1
in 1
his 1
agitation 1
then 1
he 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
low 1
laugh 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
my 1
ear 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
nice 1
household 1
he 1
murmured 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
baboon 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
strange 1
pets 1
which 1
the 1
doctor 1
affected 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
cheetah 1
too 1
perhaps 1
we 1
might 1
find 1
it 1
upon 1
our 1
shoulders 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
easier 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
after 1
following 1
holmes 1
example 1
and 1
slipping 1
off 1
my 1
shoes 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
inside 1
the 1
bedroom 1
my 1
companion 1
noiselessly 1
closed 1
the 1
shutters 1
moved 1
the 1
lamp 1
onto 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
cast 1
his 1
eyes 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
all 1
was 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
then 1
creeping 1
up 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
trumpet 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
he 1
whispered 1
into 1
my 1
ear 1
again 1
so 1
gently 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
distinguish 1
the 1
words 1
the 1
least 1
sound 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
to 1
our 1
plans 1
i 1
nodded 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
we 1
must 1
sit 1
without 1
light 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
ventilator 1
i 1
nodded 1
again 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
asleep 1
your 1
very 1
life 1
may 1
depend 1
upon 1
it 1
have 1
your 1
pistol 1
ready 1
in 1
case 1
we 1
should 1
need 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
you 1
in 1
that 1
chair 1
i 1
took 1
out 1
my 1
revolver 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
holmes 1
had 1
brought 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
cane 1
and 1
this 1
he 1
placed 1
upon 1
the 1
bed 1
beside 1
him 1
by 1
it 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
box 1
of 1
matches 1
and 1
the 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
candle 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
down 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
left 1
in 1
darkness 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
ever 1
forget 1
that 1
dreadful 1
vigil 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
hear 1
a 1
sound 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
drawing 1
of 1
a 1
breath 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
sat 1
openeyed 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
state 1
of 1
nervous 1
tension 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
myself 1
the 1
shutters 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
least 1
ray 1
of 1
light 1
and 1
we 1
waited 1
in 1
absolute 1
darkness 1
from 1
outside 1
came 1
the 1
occasional 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
nightbird 1
and 1
once 1
at 1
our 1
very 1
window 1
a 1
long 1
drawn 1
catlike 1
whine 1
which 1
told 1
us 1
that 1
the 1
cheetah 1
was 1
indeed 1
at 1
liberty 1
far 1
away 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
deep 1
tones 1
of 1
the 1
parish 1
clock 1
which 1
boomed 1
out 1
every 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
how 1
long 1
they 1
seemed 1
those 1
quarters 1
twelve 1
struck 1
and 1
one 1
and 1
two 1
and 1
three 1
and 1
still 1
we 1
sat 1
waiting 1
silently 1
for 1
whatever 1
might 1
befall 1
suddenly 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
momentary 1
gleam 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
ventilator 1
which 1
vanished 1
immediately 1
but 1
was 1
succeeded 1
by 1
a 1
strong 1
smell 1
of 1
burning 1
oil 1
and 1
heated 1
metal 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
had 1
lit 1
a 1
darklantern 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
gentle 1
sound 1
of 1
movement 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
was 1
silent 1
once 1
more 1
though 1
the 1
smell 1
grew 1
stronger 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
i 1
sat 1
with 1
straining 1
ears 1
then 1
suddenly 1
another 1
sound 1
became 1
audiblea 1
very 1
gentle 1
soothing 1
sound 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
jet 1
of 1
steam 1
escaping 1
continually 1
from 1
a 1
kettle 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
we 1
heard 1
it 1
holmes 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
struck 1
a 1
match 1
and 1
lashed 1
furiously 1
with 1
his 1
cane 1
at 1
the 1
bellpull 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
watson 1
he 1
yelled 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
nothing 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
holmes 1
struck 1
the 1
light 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
low 1
clear 1
whistle 1
but 1
the 1
sudden 1
glare 1
flashing 1
into 1
my 1
weary 1
eyes 1
made 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
lashed 1
so 1
savagely 1
i 1
could 1
however 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
deadly 1
pale 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
horror 1
and 1
loathing 1
he 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
strike 1
and 1
was 1
gazing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
ventilator 1
when 1
suddenly 1
there 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
cry 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
it 1
swelled 1
up 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
a 1
hoarse 1
yell 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
fear 1
and 1
anger 1
all 1
mingled 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
dreadful 1
shriek 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
distant 1
parsonage 1
that 1
cry 1
raised 1
the 1
sleepers 1
from 1
their 1
beds 1
it 1
struck 1
cold 1
to 1
our 1
hearts 1
and 1
i 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
holmes 1
and 1
he 1
at 1
me 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
echoes 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
silence 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
rose 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
mean 1
i 1
gasped 1
it 1
means 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
holmes 1
answered 1
and 1
perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
take 1
your 1
pistol 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
enter 1
dr 1
roylotts 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
grave 1
face 1
he 1
lit 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
twice 1
he 1
struck 1
at 1
the 1
chamber 1
door 1
without 1
any 1
reply 1
from 1
within 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
handle 1
and 1
entered 1
i 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
with 1
the 1
cocked 1
pistol 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
sight 1
which 1
met 1
our 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
stood 1
a 1
darklantern 1
with 1
the 1
shutter 1
half 1
open 1
throwing 1
a 1
brilliant 1
beam 1
of 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
iron 1
safe 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
ajar 1
beside 1
this 1
table 1
on 1
the 1
wooden 1
chair 1
sat 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylott 1
clad 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
grey 1
dressinggown 1
his 1
bare 1
ankles 1
protruding 1
beneath 1
and 1
his 1
feet 1
thrust 1
into 1
red 1
heelless 1
turkish 1
slippers 1
across 1
his 1
lap 1
lay 1
the 1
short 1
stock 1
with 1
the 1
long 1
lash 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
noticed 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
his 1
chin 1
was 1
cocked 1
upward 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
fixed 1
in 1
a 1
dreadful 1
rigid 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
round 1
his 1
brow 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
peculiar 1
yellow 1
band 1
with 1
brownish 1
speckles 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
bound 1
tightly 1
round 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
he 1
made 1
neither 1
sound 1
nor 1
motion 1
the 1
band 1
the 1
speckled 1
band 1
whispered 1
holmes 1
i 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
his 1
strange 1
headgear 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
there 1
reared 1
itself 1
from 1
among 1
his 1
hair 1
the 1
squat 1
diamondshaped 1
head 1
and 1
puffed 1
neck 1
of 1
a 1
loathsome 1
serpent 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
swamp 1
adder 1
cried 1
holmes 1
the 1
deadliest 1
snake 1
in 1
india 1
he 1
has 1
died 1
within 1
ten 1
seconds 1
of 1
being 1
bitten 1
violence 1
does 1
in 1
truth 1
recoil 1
upon 1
the 1
violent 1
and 1
the 1
schemer 1
falls 1
into 1
the 1
pit 1
which 1
he 1
digs 1
for 1
another 1
let 1
us 1
thrust 1
this 1
creature 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
den 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
then 1
remove 1
miss 1
stoner 1
to 1
some 1
place 1
of 1
shelter 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
county 1
police 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
dogwhip 1
swiftly 1
from 1
the 1
dead 1
mans 1
lap 1
and 1
throwing 1
the 1
noose 1
round 1
the 1
reptiles 1
neck 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
from 1
its 1
horrid 1
perch 1
and 1
carrying 1
it 1
at 1
arms 1
length 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
iron 1
safe 1
which 1
he 1
closed 1
upon 1
it 1
such 1
are 1
the 1
true 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylott 1
of 1
stoke 1
moran 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
necessary 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
prolong 1
a 1
narrative 1
which 1
has 1
already 1
run 1
to 1
too 1
great 1
a 1
length 1
by 1
telling 1
how 1
we 1
broke 1
the 1
sad 1
news 1
to 1
the 1
terrified 1
girl 1
how 1
we 1
conveyed 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
morning 1
train 1
to 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
good 1
aunt 1
at 1
harrow 1
of 1
how 1
the 1
slow 1
process 1
of 1
official 1
inquiry 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
conclusion 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
met 1
his 1
fate 1
while 1
indiscreetly 1
playing 1
with 1
a 1
dangerous 1
pet 1
the 1
little 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
yet 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
was 1
told 1
me 1
by 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
travelled 1
back 1
next 1
day 1
i 1
had 1
said 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
entirely 1
erroneous 1
conclusion 1
which 1
shows 1
my 1
dear 1
watson 1
how 1
dangerous 1
it 1
always 1
is 1
to 1
reason 1
from 1
insufficient 1
data 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
gipsies 1
and 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
band 1
which 1
was 1
used 1
by 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
appearance 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
hurried 1
glimpse 1
of 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
her 1
match 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
put 1
me 1
upon 1
an 1
entirely 1
wrong 1
scent 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
claim 1
the 1
merit 1
that 1
i 1
instantly 1
reconsidered 1
my 1
position 1
when 1
however 1
it 1
became 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
whatever 1
danger 1
threatened 1
an 1
occupant 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
either 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
or 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
speedily 1
drawn 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
remarked 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
this 1
ventilator 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
bellrope 1
which 1
hung 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
discovery 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
dummy 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
bed 1
was 1
clamped 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
instantly 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
the 1
suspicion 1
that 1
the 1
rope 1
was 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
bridge 1
for 1
something 1
passing 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
instantly 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
coupled 1
it 1
with 1
my 1
knowledge 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
furnished 1
with 1
a 1
supply 1
of 1
creatures 1
from 1
india 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
probably 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
track 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
using 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
poison 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
be 1
discovered 1
by 1
any 1
chemical 1
test 1
was 1
just 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
as 1
would 1
occur 1
to 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
ruthless 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
had 1
an 1
eastern 1
training 1
the 1
rapidity 1
with 1
which 1
such 1
a 1
poison 1
would 1
take 1
effect 1
would 1
also 1
from 1
his 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
be 1
an 1
advantage 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
sharpeyed 1
coroner 1
indeed 1
who 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
two 1
little 1
dark 1
punctures 1
which 1
would 1
show 1
where 1
the 1
poison 1
fangs 1
had 1
done 1
their 1
work 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
whistle 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
must 1
recall 1
the 1
snake 1
before 1
the 1
morning 1
light 1
revealed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
victim 1
he 1
had 1
trained 1
it 1
probably 1
by 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
milk 1
which 1
we 1
saw 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
summoned 1
he 1
would 1
put 1
it 1
through 1
this 1
ventilator 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
best 1
with 1
the 1
certainty 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
crawl 1
down 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
land 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
it 1
might 1
or 1
might 1
not 1
bite 1
the 1
occupant 1
perhaps 1
she 1
might 1
escape 1
every 1
night 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
but 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
she 1
must 1
fall 1
a 1
victim 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
these 1
conclusions 1
before 1
ever 1
i 1
had 1
entered 1
his 1
room 1
an 1
inspection 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
standing 1
on 1
it 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
would 1
be 1
necessary 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
reach 1
the 1
ventilator 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
safe 1
the 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
and 1
the 1
loop 1
of 1
whipcord 1
were 1
enough 1
to 1
finally 1
dispel 1
any 1
doubts 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
remained 1
the 1
metallic 1
clang 1
heard 1
by 1
miss 1
stoner 1
was 1
obviously 1
caused 1
by 1
her 1
stepfather 1
hastily 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
safe 1
upon 1
its 1
terrible 1
occupant 1
having 1
once 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
the 1
proof 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
creature 1
hiss 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
also 1
and 1
i 1
instantly 1
lit 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
attacked 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
driving 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
ventilator 1
and 1
also 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
causing 1
it 1
to 1
turn 1
upon 1
its 1
master 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
blows 1
of 1
my 1
cane 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
roused 1
its 1
snakish 1
temper 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
flew 1
upon 1
the 1
first 1
person 1
it 1
saw 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
doubt 1
indirectly 1
responsible 1
for 1
dr 1
grimesby 1
roylotts 1
death 1
and 1
i 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
weigh 1
very 1
heavily 1
upon 1
my 1
conscience 1
ix 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
engineers 1
thumb 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
problems 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
submitted 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
for 1
solution 1
during 1
the 1
years 1
of 1
our 1
intimacy 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
two 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
introducing 1
to 1
his 1
noticethat 1
of 1
mr 1
hatherleys 1
thumb 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
colonel 1
warburtons 1
madness 1
of 1
these 1
the 1
latter 1
may 1
have 1
afforded 1
a 1
finer 1
field 1
for 1
an 1
acute 1
and 1
original 1
observer 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
so 1
strange 1
in 1
its 1
inception 1
and 1
so 1
dramatic 1
in 1
its 1
details 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
more 1
worthy 1
of 1
being 1
placed 1
upon 1
record 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
gave 1
my 1
friend 1
fewer 1
openings 1
for 1
those 1
deductive 1
methods 1
of 1
reasoning 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
achieved 1
such 1
remarkable 1
results 1
the 1
story 1
has 1
i 1
believe 1
been 1
told 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
newspapers 1
but 1
like 1
all 1
such 1
narratives 1
its 1
effect 1
is 1
much 1
less 1
striking 1
when 1
set 1
forth 1
en 1
bloc 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
halfcolumn 1
of 1
print 1
than 1
when 1
the 1
facts 1
slowly 1
evolve 1
before 1
your 1
own 1
eyes 1
and 1
the 1
mystery 1
clears 1
gradually 1
away 1
as 1
each 1
new 1
discovery 1
furnishes 1
a 1
step 1
which 1
leads 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
complete 1
truth 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
circumstances 1
made 1
a 1
deep 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
lapse 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
has 1
hardly 1
served 1
to 1
weaken 1
the 1
effect 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
of 1
89 1
not 1
long 1
after 1
my 1
marriage 1
that 1
the 1
events 1
occurred 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
about 1
to 1
summarise 1
i 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
civil 1
practice 1
and 1
had 1
finally 1
abandoned 1
holmes 1
in 1
his 1
baker 1
street 1
rooms 1
although 1
i 1
continually 1
visited 1
him 1
and 1
occasionally 1
even 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
forgo 1
his 1
bohemian 1
habits 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
visit 1
us 1
my 1
practice 1
had 1
steadily 1
increased 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
no 1
very 1
great 1
distance 1
from 1
paddington 1
station 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
few 1
patients 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
officials 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
cured 1
of 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
lingering 1
disease 1
was 1
never 1
weary 1
of 1
advertising 1
my 1
virtues 1
and 1
of 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
send 1
me 1
on 1
every 1
sufferer 1
over 1
whom 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
any 1
influence 1
one 1
morning 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
before 1
seven 1
oclock 1
i 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
maid 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
announce 1
that 1
two 1
men 1
had 1
come 1
from 1
paddington 1
and 1
were 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
consultingroom 1
i 1
dressed 1
hurriedly 1
for 1
i 1
knew 1
by 1
experience 1
that 1
railway 1
cases 1
were 1
seldom 1
trivial 1
and 1
hastened 1
downstairs 1
as 1
i 1
descended 1
my 1
old 1
ally 1
the 1
guard 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
tightly 1
behind 1
him 1
ive 1
got 1
him 1
here 1
he 1
whispered 1
jerking 1
his 1
thumb 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
hes 1
all 1
right 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
manner 1
suggested 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
strange 1
creature 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
caged 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
its 1
a 1
new 1
patient 1
he 1
whispered 1
i 1
thought 1
id 1
bring 1
him 1
round 1
myself 1
then 1
he 1
couldnt 1
slip 1
away 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
all 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
now 1
doctor 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
dooties 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
you 1
and 1
off 1
he 1
went 1
this 1
trusty 1
tout 1
without 1
even 1
giving 1
me 1
time 1
to 1
thank 1
him 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
consultingroom 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
gentleman 1
seated 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
was 1
quietly 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
heather 1
tweed 1
with 1
a 1
soft 1
cloth 1
cap 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
down 1
upon 1
my 1
books 1
round 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
wrapped 1
which 1
was 1
mottled 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
bloodstains 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
fiveandtwenty 1
i 1
should 1
say 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
masculine 1
face 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
pale 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
suffering 1
from 1
some 1
strong 1
agitation 1
which 1
it 1
took 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
of 1
mind 1
to 1
control 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
knock 1
you 1
up 1
so 1
early 1
doctor 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
accident 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
came 1
in 1
by 1
train 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
on 1
inquiring 1
at 1
paddington 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
i 1
might 1
find 1
a 1
doctor 1
a 1
worthy 1
fellow 1
very 1
kindly 1
escorted 1
me 1
here 1
i 1
gave 1
the 1
maid 1
a 1
card 1
but 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
left 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
sidetable 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
mr 1
victor 1
hatherley 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
16a 1
victoria 1
street 1
3rd 1
floor 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
style 1
and 1
abode 1
of 1
my 1
morning 1
visitor 1
i 1
regret 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
kept 1
you 1
waiting 1
said 1
i 1
sitting 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
librarychair 1
you 1
are 1
fresh 1
from 1
a 1
night 1
journey 1
i 1
understand 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
itself 1
a 1
monotonous 1
occupation 1
oh 1
my 1
night 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
called 1
monotonous 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
laughed 1
he 1
laughed 1
very 1
heartily 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
ringing 1
note 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
sides 1
all 1
my 1
medical 1
instincts 1
rose 1
up 1
against 1
that 1
laugh 1
stop 1
it 1
i 1
cried 1
pull 1
yourself 1
together 1
and 1
i 1
poured 1
out 1
some 1
water 1
from 1
a 1
caraffe 1
it 1
was 1
useless 1
however 1
he 1
was 1
off 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
hysterical 1
outbursts 1
which 1
come 1
upon 1
a 1
strong 1
nature 1
when 1
some 1
great 1
crisis 1
is 1
over 1
and 1
gone 1
presently 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
once 1
more 1
very 1
weary 1
and 1
palelooking 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
making 1
a 1
fool 1
of 1
myself 1
he 1
gasped 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
drink 1
this 1
i 1
dashed 1
some 1
brandy 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
began 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
bloodless 1
cheeks 1
thats 1
better 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
now 1
doctor 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
kindly 1
attend 1
to 1
my 1
thumb 1
or 1
rather 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
my 1
thumb 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
he 1
unwound 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
it 1
gave 1
even 1
my 1
hardened 1
nerves 1
a 1
shudder 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
there 1
were 1
four 1
protruding 1
fingers 1
and 1
a 1
horrid 1
red 1
spongy 1
surface 1
where 1
the 1
thumb 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
hacked 1
or 1
torn 1
right 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
roots 1
good 1
heavens 1
i 1
cried 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
injury 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
bled 1
considerably 1
yes 1
it 1
did 1
i 1
fainted 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
senseless 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
bleeding 1
so 1
i 1
tied 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
very 1
tightly 1
round 1
the 1
wrist 1
and 1
braced 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
twig 1
excellent 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
surgeon 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
hydraulics 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
came 1
within 1
my 1
own 1
province 1
this 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
said 1
i 1
examining 1
the 1
wound 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
and 1
sharp 1
instrument 1
a 1
thing 1
like 1
a 1
cleaver 1
said 1
he 1
an 1
accident 1
i 1
presume 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
what 1
a 1
murderous 1
attack 1
very 1
murderous 1
indeed 1
you 1
horrify 1
me 1
i 1
sponged 1
the 1
wound 1
cleaned 1
it 1
dressed 1
it 1
and 1
finally 1
covered 1
it 1
over 1
with 1
cotton 1
wadding 1
and 1
carbolised 1
bandages 1
he 1
lay 1
back 1
without 1
wincing 1
though 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
how 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
asked 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
finished 1
capital 1
between 1
your 1
brandy 1
and 1
your 1
bandage 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
new 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
weak 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
perhaps 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
not 1
speak 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
is 1
evidently 1
trying 1
to 1
your 1
nerves 1
oh 1
no 1
not 1
now 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
my 1
tale 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
but 1
between 1
ourselves 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
convincing 1
evidence 1
of 1
this 1
wound 1
of 1
mine 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
they 1
believed 1
my 1
statement 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
extraordinary 1
one 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
much 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
proof 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
back 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
believe 1
me 1
the 1
clues 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
give 1
them 1
are 1
so 1
vague 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
justice 1
will 1
be 1
done 1
ha 1
cried 1
i 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
a 1
problem 1
which 1
you 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
solved 1
i 1
should 1
strongly 1
recommend 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
before 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
oh 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
that 1
fellow 1
answered 1
my 1
visitor 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
though 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
must 1
use 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
as 1
well 1
would 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
introduction 1
to 1
him 1
ill 1
do 1
better 1
ill 1
take 1
you 1
round 1
to 1
him 1
myself 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
immensely 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
well 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
go 1
together 1
we 1
shall 1
just 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
breakfast 1
with 1
him 1
do 1
you 1
feel 1
equal 1
to 1
it 1
yes 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
feel 1
easy 1
until 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
my 1
story 1
then 1
my 1
servant 1
will 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
i 1
rushed 1
upstairs 1
explained 1
the 1
matter 1
shortly 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
was 1
inside 1
a 1
hansom 1
driving 1
with 1
my 1
new 1
acquaintance 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
as 1
i 1
expected 1
lounging 1
about 1
his 1
sittingroom 1
in 1
his 1
dressinggown 1
reading 1
the 1
agony 1
column 1
of 1
the 1
times 1
and 1
smoking 1
his 1
beforebreakfast 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
composed 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
plugs 1
and 1
dottles 1
left 1
from 1
his 1
smokes 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
all 1
carefully 1
dried 1
and 1
collected 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
he 1
received 1
us 1
in 1
his 1
quietly 1
genial 1
fashion 1
ordered 1
fresh 1
rashers 1
and 1
eggs 1
and 1
joined 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hearty 1
meal 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
concluded 1
he 1
settled 1
our 1
new 1
acquaintance 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
placed 1
a 1
pillow 1
beneath 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
laid 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
water 1
within 1
his 1
reach 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
your 1
experience 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
common 1
one 1
mr 1
hatherley 1
said 1
he 1
pray 1
lie 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
make 1
yourself 1
absolutely 1
at 1
home 1
tell 1
us 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
but 1
stop 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
and 1
keep 1
up 1
your 1
strength 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
stimulant 1
thank 1
you 1
said 1
my 1
patient 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
felt 1
another 1
man 1
since 1
the 1
doctor 1
bandaged 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
your 1
breakfast 1
has 1
completed 1
the 1
cure 1
i 1
shall 1
take 1
up 1
as 1
little 1
of 1
your 1
valuable 1
time 1
as 1
possible 1
so 1
i 1
shall 1
start 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
my 1
peculiar 1
experiences 1
holmes 1
sat 1
in 1
his 1
big 1
armchair 1
with 1
the 1
weary 1
heavylidded 1
expression 1
which 1
veiled 1
his 1
keen 1
and 1
eager 1
nature 1
while 1
i 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
we 1
listened 1
in 1
silence 1
to 1
the 1
strange 1
story 1
which 1
our 1
visitor 1
detailed 1
to 1
us 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
bachelor 1
residing 1
alone 1
in 1
lodgings 1
in 1
london 1
by 1
profession 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
considerable 1
experience 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
during 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
apprenticed 1
to 1
venner 1
matheson 1
the 1
wellknown 1
firm 1
of 1
greenwich 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
having 1
served 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
having 1
also 1
come 1
into 1
a 1
fair 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
through 1
my 1
poor 1
fathers 1
death 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
start 1
in 1
business 1
for 1
myself 1
and 1
took 1
professional 1
chambers 1
in 1
victoria 1
street 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
everyone 1
finds 1
his 1
first 1
independent 1
start 1
in 1
business 1
a 1
dreary 1
experience 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
exceptionally 1
so 1
during 1
two 1
years 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
three 1
consultations 1
and 1
one 1
small 1
job 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
absolutely 1
all 1
that 1
my 1
profession 1
has 1
brought 1
me 1
my 1
gross 1
takings 1
amount 1
to 1
27 1
pounds 1
10s 1
every 1
day 1
from 1
nine 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
until 1
four 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
i 1
waited 1
in 1
my 1
little 1
den 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
heart 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
and 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
any 1
practice 1
at 1
all 1
yesterday 1
however 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
leaving 1
the 1
office 1
my 1
clerk 1
entered 1
to 1
say 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
waiting 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
upon 1
business 1
he 1
brought 1
up 1
a 1
card 1
too 1
with 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
engraved 1
upon 1
it 1
close 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
came 1
the 1
colonel 1
himself 1
a 1
man 1
rather 1
over 1
the 1
middle 1
size 1
but 1
of 1
an 1
exceeding 1
thinness 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
so 1
thin 1
a 1
man 1
his 1
whole 1
face 1
sharpened 1
away 1
into 1
nose 1
and 1
chin 1
and 1
the 1
skin 1
of 1
his 1
cheeks 1
was 1
drawn 1
quite 1
tense 1
over 1
his 1
outstanding 1
bones 1
yet 1
this 1
emaciation 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
natural 1
habit 1
and 1
due 1
to 1
no 1
disease 1
for 1
his 1
eye 1
was 1
bright 1
his 1
step 1
brisk 1
and 1
his 1
bearing 1
assured 1
he 1
was 1
plainly 1
but 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
and 1
his 1
age 1
i 1
should 1
judge 1
would 1
be 1
nearer 1
forty 1
than 1
thirty 1
mr 1
hatherley 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
german 1
accent 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
recommended 1
to 1
me 1
mr 1
hatherley 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
proficient 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
but 1
is 1
also 1
discreet 1
and 1
capable 1
of 1
preserving 1
a 1
secret 1
i 1
bowed 1
feeling 1
as 1
flattered 1
as 1
any 1
young 1
man 1
would 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
address 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
who 1
gave 1
me 1
so 1
good 1
a 1
character 1
well 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
just 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
i 1
have 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
source 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
both 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
bachelor 1
and 1
are 1
residing 1
alone 1
in 1
london 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
correct 1
i 1
answered 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
see 1
how 1
all 1
this 1
bears 1
upon 1
my 1
professional 1
qualifications 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
professional 1
matter 1
that 1
you 1
wished 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
undoubtedly 1
so 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
that 1
all 1
i 1
say 1
is 1
really 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
professional 1
commission 1
for 1
you 1
but 1
absolute 1
secrecy 1
is 1
quite 1
essentialabsolute 1
secrecy 1
you 1
understand 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
may 1
expect 1
that 1
more 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
alone 1
than 1
from 1
one 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
if 1
i 1
promise 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
secret 1
said 1
i 1
you 1
may 1
absolutely 1
depend 1
upon 1
my 1
doing 1
so 1
he 1
looked 1
very 1
hard 1
at 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
so 1
suspicious 1
and 1
questioning 1
an 1
eye 1
do 1
you 1
promise 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
yes 1
i 1
promise 1
absolute 1
and 1
complete 1
silence 1
before 1
during 1
and 1
after 1
no 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
matter 1
at 1
all 1
either 1
in 1
word 1
or 1
writing 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
given 1
you 1
my 1
word 1
very 1
good 1
he 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
darting 1
like 1
lightning 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
flung 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
passage 1
outside 1
was 1
empty 1
thats 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
coming 1
back 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
clerks 1
are 1
sometimes 1
curious 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
masters 1
affairs 1
now 1
we 1
can 1
talk 1
in 1
safety 1
he 1
drew 1
up 1
his 1
chair 1
very 1
close 1
to 1
mine 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stare 1
at 1
me 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
questioning 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
look 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
repulsion 1
and 1
of 1
something 1
akin 1
to 1
fear 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
rise 1
within 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
strange 1
antics 1
of 1
this 1
fleshless 1
man 1
even 1
my 1
dread 1
of 1
losing 1
a 1
client 1
could 1
not 1
restrain 1
me 1
from 1
showing 1
my 1
impatience 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
state 1
your 1
business 1
sir 1
said 1
i 1
my 1
time 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
heaven 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
that 1
last 1
sentence 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
lips 1
how 1
would 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
for 1
a 1
nights 1
work 1
suit 1
you 1
he 1
asked 1
most 1
admirably 1
i 1
say 1
a 1
nights 1
work 1
but 1
an 1
hours 1
would 1
be 1
nearer 1
the 1
mark 1
i 1
simply 1
want 1
your 1
opinion 1
about 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
stamping 1
machine 1
which 1
has 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
gear 1
if 1
you 1
show 1
us 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
ourselves 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
commission 1
as 1
that 1
the 1
work 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
pay 1
munificent 1
precisely 1
so 1
we 1
shall 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
tonight 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
where 1
to 1
to 1
eyford 1
in 1
berkshire 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
place 1
near 1
the 1
borders 1
of 1
oxfordshire 1
and 1
within 1
seven 1
miles 1
of 1
reading 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
train 1
from 1
paddington 1
which 1
would 1
bring 1
you 1
there 1
at 1
about 1
1115 1
very 1
good 1
i 1
shall 1
come 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
carriage 1
to 1
meet 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
drive 1
then 1
yes 1
our 1
little 1
place 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
seven 1
miles 1
from 1
eyford 1
station 1
then 1
we 1
can 1
hardly 1
get 1
there 1
before 1
midnight 1
i 1
suppose 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
a 1
train 1
back 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
compelled 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
night 1
yes 1
we 1
could 1
easily 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
shakedown 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
awkward 1
could 1
i 1
not 1
come 1
at 1
some 1
more 1
convenient 1
hour 1
we 1
have 1
judged 1
it 1
best 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
come 1
late 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
any 1
inconvenience 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
paying 1
to 1
you 1
a 1
young 1
and 1
unknown 1
man 1
a 1
fee 1
which 1
would 1
buy 1
an 1
opinion 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
heads 1
of 1
your 1
profession 1
still 1
of 1
course 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
draw 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
there 1
is 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
and 1
of 1
how 1
very 1
useful 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
to 1
accommodate 1
myself 1
to 1
your 1
wishes 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
however 1
to 1
understand 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
clearly 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
quite 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
natural 1
that 1
the 1
pledge 1
of 1
secrecy 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
exacted 1
from 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
aroused 1
your 1
curiosity 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
wish 1
to 1
commit 1
you 1
to 1
anything 1
without 1
your 1
having 1
it 1
all 1
laid 1
before 1
you 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
absolutely 1
safe 1
from 1
eavesdroppers 1
entirely 1
then 1
the 1
matter 1
stands 1
thus 1
you 1
are 1
probably 1
aware 1
that 1
fullersearth 1
is 1
a 1
valuable 1
product 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
found 1
in 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
places 1
in 1
england 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
so 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
ago 1
i 1
bought 1
a 1
small 1
placea 1
very 1
small 1
placewithin 1
ten 1
miles 1
of 1
reading 1
i 1
was 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
deposit 1
of 1
fullersearth 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
fields 1
on 1
examining 1
it 1
however 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
this 1
deposit 1
was 1
a 1
comparatively 1
small 1
one 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
formed 1
a 1
link 1
between 1
two 1
very 1
much 1
larger 1
ones 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
leftboth 1
of 1
them 1
however 1
in 1
the 1
grounds 1
of 1
my 1
neighbours 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
were 1
absolutely 1
ignorant 1
that 1
their 1
land 1
contained 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
quite 1
as 1
valuable 1
as 1
a 1
goldmine 1
naturally 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
my 1
interest 1
to 1
buy 1
their 1
land 1
before 1
they 1
discovered 1
its 1
true 1
value 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
capital 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
this 1
i 1
took 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
into 1
the 1
secret 1
however 1
and 1
they 1
suggested 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
quietly 1
and 1
secretly 1
work 1
our 1
own 1
little 1
deposit 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
we 1
should 1
earn 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
would 1
enable 1
us 1
to 1
buy 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
fields 1
this 1
we 1
have 1
now 1
been 1
doing 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
our 1
operations 1
we 1
erected 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
this 1
press 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
explained 1
has 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
order 1
and 1
we 1
wish 1
your 1
advice 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
we 1
guard 1
our 1
secret 1
very 1
jealously 1
however 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
once 1
became 1
known 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
hydraulic 1
engineers 1
coming 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
house 1
it 1
would 1
soon 1
rouse 1
inquiry 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
the 1
facts 1
came 1
out 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
goodbye 1
to 1
any 1
chance 1
of 1
getting 1
these 1
fields 1
and 1
carrying 1
out 1
our 1
plans 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
tell 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
eyford 1
tonight 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
make 1
it 1
all 1
plain 1
i 1
quite 1
follow 1
you 1
said 1
i 1
the 1
only 1
point 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
quite 1
understand 1
was 1
what 1
use 1
you 1
could 1
make 1
of 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
in 1
excavating 1
fullersearth 1
which 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
is 1
dug 1
out 1
like 1
gravel 1
from 1
a 1
pit 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
carelessly 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
own 1
process 1
we 1
compress 1
the 1
earth 1
into 1
bricks 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
remove 1
them 1
without 1
revealing 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
mere 1
detail 1
i 1
have 1
taken 1
you 1
fully 1
into 1
my 1
confidence 1
now 1
mr 1
hatherley 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
shown 1
you 1
how 1
i 1
trust 1
you 1
he 1
rose 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
i 1
shall 1
expect 1
you 1
then 1
at 1
eyford 1
at 1
1115 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
be 1
there 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
a 1
soul 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
last 1
long 1
questioning 1
gaze 1
and 1
then 1
pressing 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
dank 1
grasp 1
he 1
hurried 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
well 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
in 1
cool 1
blood 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
astonished 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
both 1
think 1
at 1
this 1
sudden 1
commission 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
intrusted 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
hand 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
for 1
the 1
fee 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
tenfold 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
asked 1
had 1
i 1
set 1
a 1
price 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
services 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
this 1
order 1
might 1
lead 1
to 1
other 1
ones 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
patron 1
had 1
made 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
his 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
fullersearth 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
my 1
coming 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
his 1
extreme 1
anxiety 1
lest 1
i 1
should 1
tell 1
anyone 1
of 1
my 1
errand 1
however 1
i 1
threw 1
all 1
fears 1
to 1
the 1
winds 1
ate 1
a 1
hearty 1
supper 1
drove 1
to 1
paddington 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
having 1
obeyed 1
to 1
the 1
letter 1
the 1
injunction 1
as 1
to 1
holding 1
my 1
tongue 1
at 1
reading 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
change 1
not 1
only 1
my 1
carriage 1
but 1
my 1
station 1
however 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
to 1
eyford 1
and 1
i 1
reached 1
the 1
little 1
dimlit 1
station 1
after 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
passenger 1
who 1
got 1
out 1
there 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
upon 1
the 1
platform 1
save 1
a 1
single 1
sleepy 1
porter 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
wicket 1
gate 1
however 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
he 1
grasped 1
my 1
arm 1
and 1
hurried 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
carriage 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
standing 1
open 1
he 1
drew 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
tapped 1
on 1
the 1
woodwork 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
the 1
horse 1
could 1
go 1
one 1
horse 1
interjected 1
holmes 1
yes 1
only 1
one 1
did 1
you 1
observe 1
the 1
colour 1
yes 1
i 1
saw 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
sidelights 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
stepping 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
chestnut 1
tiredlooking 1
or 1
fresh 1
oh 1
fresh 1
and 1
glossy 1
thank 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
have 1
interrupted 1
you 1
pray 1
continue 1
your 1
most 1
interesting 1
statement 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
then 1
and 1
we 1
drove 1
for 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
hour 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
seven 1
miles 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
from 1
the 1
rate 1
that 1
we 1
seemed 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
took 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
nearer 1
twelve 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
in 1
silence 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
when 1
i 1
glanced 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
great 1
intensity 1
the 1
country 1
roads 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
not 1
very 1
good 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
we 1
lurched 1
and 1
jolted 1
terribly 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
to 1
see 1
something 1
of 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
frosted 1
glass 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
nothing 1
save 1
the 1
occasional 1
bright 1
blur 1
of 1
a 1
passing 1
light 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
hazarded 1
some 1
remark 1
to 1
break 1
the 1
monotony 1
of 1
the 1
journey 1
but 1
the 1
colonel 1
answered 1
only 1
in 1
monosyllables 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
soon 1
flagged 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
the 1
bumping 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
exchanged 1
for 1
the 1
crisp 1
smoothness 1
of 1
a 1
graveldrive 1
and 1
the 1
carriage 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
stand 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
followed 1
after 1
him 1
pulled 1
me 1
swiftly 1
into 1
a 1
porch 1
which 1
gaped 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
we 1
stepped 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
failed 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
most 1
fleeting 1
glance 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
the 1
door 1
slammed 1
heavily 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
faintly 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
the 1
wheels 1
as 1
the 1
carriage 1
drove 1
away 1
it 1
was 1
pitch 1
dark 1
inside 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
colonel 1
fumbled 1
about 1
looking 1
for 1
matches 1
and 1
muttering 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
suddenly 1
a 1
door 1
opened 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
golden 1
bar 1
of 1
light 1
shot 1
out 1
in 1
our 1
direction 1
it 1
grew 1
broader 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
appeared 1
with 1
a 1
lamp 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
which 1
she 1
held 1
above 1
her 1
head 1
pushing 1
her 1
face 1
forward 1
and 1
peering 1
at 1
us 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
pretty 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
gloss 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
light 1
shone 1
upon 1
her 1
dark 1
dress 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
rich 1
material 1
she 1
spoke 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
in 1
a 1
foreign 1
tongue 1
in 1
a 1
tone 1
as 1
though 1
asking 1
a 1
question 1
and 1
when 1
my 1
companion 1
answered 1
in 1
a 1
gruff 1
monosyllable 1
she 1
gave 1
such 1
a 1
start 1
that 1
the 1
lamp 1
nearly 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
hand 1
colonel 1
stark 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
whispered 1
something 1
in 1
her 1
ear 1
and 1
then 1
pushing 1
her 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
from 1
whence 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
he 1
walked 1
towards 1
me 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
lamp 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
wait 1
in 1
this 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
said 1
he 1
throwing 1
open 1
another 1
door 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
little 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
round 1
table 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
on 1
which 1
several 1
german 1
books 1
were 1
scattered 1
colonel 1
stark 1
laid 1
down 1
the 1
lamp 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
harmonium 1
beside 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
keep 1
you 1
waiting 1
an 1
instant 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
i 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
books 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
my 1
ignorance 1
of 1
german 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
treatises 1
on 1
science 1
the 1
others 1
being 1
volumes 1
of 1
poetry 1
then 1
i 1
walked 1
across 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
hoping 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
catch 1
some 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
countryside 1
but 1
an 1
oak 1
shutter 1
heavily 1
barred 1
was 1
folded 1
across 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
wonderfully 1
silent 1
house 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
clock 1
ticking 1
loudly 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
but 1
otherwise 1
everything 1
was 1
deadly 1
still 1
a 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
uneasiness 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
over 1
me 1
who 1
were 1
these 1
german 1
people 1
and 1
what 1
were 1
they 1
doing 1
living 1
in 1
this 1
strange 1
outoftheway 1
place 1
and 1
where 1
was 1
the 1
place 1
i 1
was 1
ten 1
miles 1
or 1
so 1
from 1
eyford 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
i 1
knew 1
but 1
whether 1
north 1
south 1
east 1
or 1
west 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
reading 1
and 1
possibly 1
other 1
large 1
towns 1
were 1
within 1
that 1
radius 1
so 1
the 1
place 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
secluded 1
after 1
all 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
certain 1
from 1
the 1
absolute 1
stillness 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
i 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
humming 1
a 1
tune 1
under 1
my 1
breath 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
my 1
spirits 1
and 1
feeling 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
thoroughly 1
earning 1
my 1
fiftyguinea 1
fee 1
suddenly 1
without 1
any 1
preliminary 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
utter 1
stillness 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
room 1
swung 1
slowly 1
open 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
aperture 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
behind 1
her 1
the 1
yellow 1
light 1
from 1
my 1
lamp 1
beating 1
upon 1
her 1
eager 1
and 1
beautiful 1
face 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
sick 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
the 1
sight 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
she 1
held 1
up 1
one 1
shaking 1
finger 1
to 1
warn 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
silent 1
and 1
she 1
shot 1
a 1
few 1
whispered 1
words 1
of 1
broken 1
english 1
at 1
me 1
her 1
eyes 1
glancing 1
back 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
frightened 1
horse 1
into 1
the 1
gloom 1
behind 1
her 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
said 1
she 1
trying 1
hard 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
speak 1
calmly 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
stay 1
here 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
madam 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
done 1
what 1
i 1
came 1
for 1
i 1
cannot 1
possibly 1
leave 1
until 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
machine 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
worth 1
your 1
while 1
to 1
wait 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
you 1
can 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
no 1
one 1
hinders 1
and 1
then 1
seeing 1
that 1
i 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
she 1
suddenly 1
threw 1
aside 1
her 1
constraint 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
wrung 1
together 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
heaven 1
she 1
whispered 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
before 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
somewhat 1
headstrong 1
by 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
ready 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
an 1
affair 1
when 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
obstacle 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
fiftyguinea 1
fee 1
of 1
my 1
wearisome 1
journey 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
unpleasant 1
night 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
before 1
me 1
was 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
nothing 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
slink 1
away 1
without 1
having 1
carried 1
out 1
my 1
commission 1
and 1
without 1
the 1
payment 1
which 1
was 1
my 1
due 1
this 1
woman 1
might 1
for 1
all 1
i 1
knew 1
be 1
a 1
monomaniac 1
with 1
a 1
stout 1
bearing 1
therefore 1
though 1
her 1
manner 1
had 1
shaken 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
cared 1
to 1
confess 1
i 1
still 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
declared 1
my 1
intention 1
of 1
remaining 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
renew 1
her 1
entreaties 1
when 1
a 1
door 1
slammed 1
overhead 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
several 1
footsteps 1
was 1
heard 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
she 1
listened 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
threw 1
up 1
her 1
hands 1
with 1
a 1
despairing 1
gesture 1
and 1
vanished 1
as 1
suddenly 1
and 1
as 1
noiselessly 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
the 1
newcomers 1
were 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
and 1
a 1
short 1
thick 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
chinchilla 1
beard 1
growing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
double 1
chin 1
who 1
was 1
introduced 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
mr 1
ferguson 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
secretary 1
and 1
manager 1
said 1
the 1
colonel 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
i 1
left 1
this 1
door 1
shut 1
just 1
now 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
felt 1
the 1
draught 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
myself 1
because 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
close 1
he 1
shot 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
suspicious 1
looks 1
at 1
me 1
perhaps 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
proceed 1
to 1
business 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
mr 1
ferguson 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
machine 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
put 1
my 1
hat 1
on 1
i 1
suppose 1
oh 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
what 1
you 1
dig 1
fullersearth 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
no 1
no 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
where 1
we 1
compress 1
it 1
but 1
never 1
mind 1
that 1
all 1
we 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
to 1
let 1
us 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
with 1
it 1
we 1
went 1
upstairs 1
together 1
the 1
colonel 1
first 1
with 1
the 1
lamp 1
the 1
fat 1
manager 1
and 1
i 1
behind 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
house 1
with 1
corridors 1
passages 1
narrow 1
winding 1
staircases 1
and 1
little 1
low 1
doors 1
the 1
thresholds 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
hollowed 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
generations 1
who 1
had 1
crossed 1
them 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
carpets 1
and 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
furniture 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
while 1
the 1
plaster 1
was 1
peeling 1
off 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
the 1
damp 1
was 1
breaking 1
through 1
in 1
green 1
unhealthy 1
blotches 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
as 1
unconcerned 1
an 1
air 1
as 1
possible 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
forgotten 1
the 1
warnings 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
disregarded 1
them 1
and 1
i 1
kept 1
a 1
keen 1
eye 1
upon 1
my 1
two 1
companions 1
ferguson 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
morose 1
and 1
silent 1
man 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
fellowcountryman 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
stopped 1
at 1
last 1
before 1
a 1
low 1
door 1
which 1
he 1
unlocked 1
within 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
square 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
hardly 1
get 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
ferguson 1
remained 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
colonel 1
ushered 1
me 1
in 1
we 1
are 1
now 1
said 1
he 1
actually 1
within 1
the 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
particularly 1
unpleasant 1
thing 1
for 1
us 1
if 1
anyone 1
were 1
to 1
turn 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
ceiling 1
of 1
this 1
small 1
chamber 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
descending 1
piston 1
and 1
it 1
comes 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
many 1
tons 1
upon 1
this 1
metal 1
floor 1
there 1
are 1
small 1
lateral 1
columns 1
of 1
water 1
outside 1
which 1
receive 1
the 1
force 1
and 1
which 1
transmit 1
and 1
multiply 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
manner 1
which 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
machine 1
goes 1
readily 1
enough 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
stiffness 1
in 1
the 1
working 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
lost 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
its 1
force 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
look 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
us 1
how 1
we 1
can 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
machine 1
very 1
thoroughly 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
gigantic 1
one 1
and 1
capable 1
of 1
exercising 1
enormous 1
pressure 1
when 1
i 1
passed 1
outside 1
however 1
and 1
pressed 1
down 1
the 1
levers 1
which 1
controlled 1
it 1
i 1
knew 1
at 1
once 1
by 1
the 1
whishing 1
sound 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
leakage 1
which 1
allowed 1
a 1
regurgitation 1
of 1
water 1
through 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
side 1
cylinders 1
an 1
examination 1
showed 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
indiarubber 1
bands 1
which 1
was 1
round 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
drivingrod 1
had 1
shrunk 1
so 1
as 1
not 1
quite 1
to 1
fill 1
the 1
socket 1
along 1
which 1
it 1
worked 1
this 1
was 1
clearly 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
i 1
pointed 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
companions 1
who 1
followed 1
my 1
remarks 1
very 1
carefully 1
and 1
asked 1
several 1
practical 1
questions 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
they 1
should 1
proceed 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
them 1
i 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
chamber 1
of 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
to 1
satisfy 1
my 1
own 1
curiosity 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
fullersearth 1
was 1
the 1
merest 1
fabrication 1
for 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
absurd 1
to 1
suppose 1
that 1
so 1
powerful 1
an 1
engine 1
could 1
be 1
designed 1
for 1
so 1
inadequate 1
a 1
purpose 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
the 1
floor 1
consisted 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
trough 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
examine 1
it 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
crust 1
of 1
metallic 1
deposit 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
stooped 1
and 1
was 1
scraping 1
at 1
this 1
to 1
see 1
exactly 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
muttered 1
exclamation 1
in 1
german 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
cadaverous 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
colonel 1
looking 1
down 1
at 1
me 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
he 1
asked 1
i 1
felt 1
angry 1
at 1
having 1
been 1
tricked 1
by 1
so 1
elaborate 1
a 1
story 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
admiring 1
your 1
fullersearth 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
better 1
able 1
to 1
advise 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
machine 1
if 1
i 1
knew 1
what 1
the 1
exact 1
purpose 1
was 1
for 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
used 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
i 1
uttered 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
regretted 1
the 1
rashness 1
of 1
my 1
speech 1
his 1
face 1
set 1
hard 1
and 1
a 1
baleful 1
light 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
grey 1
eyes 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
machine 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
backward 1
slammed 1
the 1
little 1
door 1
and 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
i 1
rushed 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
the 1
handle 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
secure 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
to 1
my 1
kicks 1
and 1
shoves 1
hullo 1
i 1
yelled 1
hullo 1
colonel 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
which 1
sent 1
my 1
heart 1
into 1
my 1
mouth 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
clank 1
of 1
the 1
levers 1
and 1
the 1
swish 1
of 1
the 1
leaking 1
cylinder 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
the 1
engine 1
at 1
work 1
the 1
lamp 1
still 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
it 1
when 1
examining 1
the 1
trough 1
by 1
its 1
light 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
black 1
ceiling 1
was 1
coming 1
down 1
upon 1
me 1
slowly 1
jerkily 1
but 1
as 1
none 1
knew 1
better 1
than 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
force 1
which 1
must 1
within 1
a 1
minute 1
grind 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
shapeless 1
pulp 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
screaming 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
dragged 1
with 1
my 1
nails 1
at 1
the 1
lock 1
i 1
implored 1
the 1
colonel 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
but 1
the 1
remorseless 1
clanking 1
of 1
the 1
levers 1
drowned 1
my 1
cries 1
the 1
ceiling 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
above 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
with 1
my 1
hand 1
upraised 1
i 1
could 1
feel 1
its 1
hard 1
rough 1
surface 1
then 1
it 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
my 1
death 1
would 1
depend 1
very 1
much 1
upon 1
the 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
met 1
it 1
if 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
the 1
weight 1
would 1
come 1
upon 1
my 1
spine 1
and 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
dreadful 1
snap 1
easier 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
perhaps 1
and 1
yet 1
had 1
i 1
the 1
nerve 1
to 1
lie 1
and 1
look 1
up 1
at 1
that 1
deadly 1
black 1
shadow 1
wavering 1
down 1
upon 1
me 1
already 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
stand 1
erect 1
when 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
something 1
which 1
brought 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
hope 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
though 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
ceiling 1
were 1
of 1
iron 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
wood 1
as 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
last 1
hurried 1
glance 1
around 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
thin 1
line 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
between 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
boards 1
which 1
broadened 1
and 1
broadened 1
as 1
a 1
small 1
panel 1
was 1
pushed 1
backward 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
that 1
here 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
door 1
which 1
led 1
away 1
from 1
death 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
through 1
and 1
lay 1
halffainting 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
the 1
panel 1
had 1
closed 1
again 1
behind 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
afterwards 1
the 1
clang 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
slabs 1
of 1
metal 1
told 1
me 1
how 1
narrow 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
escape 1
i 1
was 1
recalled 1
to 1
myself 1
by 1
a 1
frantic 1
plucking 1
at 1
my 1
wrist 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
floor 1
of 1
a 1
narrow 1
corridor 1
while 1
a 1
woman 1
bent 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
tugged 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
her 1
left 1
hand 1
while 1
she 1
held 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
friend 1
whose 1
warning 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
foolishly 1
rejected 1
come 1
come 1
she 1
cried 1
breathlessly 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
they 1
will 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
there 1
oh 1
do 1
not 1
waste 1
the 1
soprecious 1
time 1
but 1
come 1
this 1
time 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
scorn 1
her 1
advice 1
i 1
staggered 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
ran 1
with 1
her 1
along 1
the 1
corridor 1
and 1
down 1
a 1
winding 1
stair 1
the 1
latter 1
led 1
to 1
another 1
broad 1
passage 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
reached 1
it 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
running 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
shouting 1
of 1
two 1
voices 1
one 1
answering 1
the 1
other 1
from 1
the 1
floor 1
on 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
one 1
beneath 1
my 1
guide 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
her 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
at 1
her 1
wits 1
end 1
then 1
she 1
threw 1
open 1
a 1
door 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
bedroom 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
shining 1
brightly 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
only 1
chance 1
said 1
she 1
it 1
is 1
high 1
but 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
jump 1
it 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
a 1
light 1
sprang 1
into 1
view 1
at 1
the 1
further 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
lean 1
figure 1
of 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
rushing 1
forward 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
weapon 1
like 1
a 1
butchers 1
cleaver 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
rushed 1
across 1
the 1
bedroom 1
flung 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
how 1
quiet 1
and 1
sweet 1
and 1
wholesome 1
the 1
garden 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
and 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
feet 1
down 1
i 1
clambered 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
sill 1
but 1
i 1
hesitated 1
to 1
jump 1
until 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
heard 1
what 1
passed 1
between 1
my 1
saviour 1
and 1
the 1
ruffian 1
who 1
pursued 1
me 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
illused 1
then 1
at 1
any 1
risks 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
assistance 1
the 1
thought 1
had 1
hardly 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
mind 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
pushing 1
his 1
way 1
past 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
back 1
fritz 1
fritz 1
she 1
cried 1
in 1
english 1
remember 1
your 1
promise 1
after 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
you 1
said 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
again 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
silent 1
oh 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
silent 1
you 1
are 1
mad 1
elise 1
he 1
shouted 1
struggling 1
to 1
break 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
us 1
he 1
has 1
seen 1
too 1
much 1
let 1
me 1
pass 1
i 1
say 1
he 1
dashed 1
her 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
cut 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
his 1
heavy 1
weapon 1
i 1
had 1
let 1
myself 1
go 1
and 1
was 1
hanging 1
by 1
the 1
hands 1
to 1
the 1
sill 1
when 1
his 1
blow 1
fell 1
i 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
dull 1
pain 1
my 1
grip 1
loosened 1
and 1
i 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
below 1
i 1
was 1
shaken 1
but 1
not 1
hurt 1
by 1
the 1
fall 1
so 1
i 1
picked 1
myself 1
up 1
and 1
rushed 1
off 1
among 1
the 1
bushes 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
run 1
for 1
i 1
understood 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
yet 1
suddenly 1
however 1
as 1
i 1
ran 1
a 1
deadly 1
dizziness 1
and 1
sickness 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
glanced 1
down 1
at 1
my 1
hand 1
which 1
was 1
throbbing 1
painfully 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
saw 1
that 1
my 1
thumb 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
was 1
pouring 1
from 1
my 1
wound 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
tie 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
round 1
it 1
but 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
sudden 1
buzzing 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
next 1
moment 1
i 1
fell 1
in 1
a 1
dead 1
faint 1
among 1
the 1
rosebushes 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
remained 1
unconscious 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
sunk 1
and 1
a 1
bright 1
morning 1
was 1
breaking 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
myself 1
my 1
clothes 1
were 1
all 1
sodden 1
with 1
dew 1
and 1
my 1
coatsleeve 1
was 1
drenched 1
with 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
wounded 1
thumb 1
the 1
smarting 1
of 1
it 1
recalled 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
all 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
my 1
nights 1
adventure 1
and 1
i 1
sprang 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
with 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
hardly 1
yet 1
be 1
safe 1
from 1
my 1
pursuers 1
but 1
to 1
my 1
astonishment 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
look 1
round 1
me 1
neither 1
house 1
nor 1
garden 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
in 1
an 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
hedge 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
highroad 1
and 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
lower 1
down 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
building 1
which 1
proved 1
upon 1
my 1
approaching 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
very 1
station 1
at 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
arrived 1
upon 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
ugly 1
wound 1
upon 1
my 1
hand 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
during 1
those 1
dreadful 1
hours 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
evil 1
dream 1
half 1
dazed 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
asked 1
about 1
the 1
morning 1
train 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
one 1
to 1
reading 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
same 1
porter 1
was 1
on 1
duty 1
i 1
found 1
as 1
had 1
been 1
there 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
i 1
inquired 1
of 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
colonel 1
lysander 1
stark 1
the 1
name 1
was 1
strange 1
to 1
him 1
had 1
he 1
observed 1
a 1
carriage 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
no 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
was 1
there 1
a 1
policestation 1
anywhere 1
near 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
about 1
three 1
miles 1
off 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
far 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
weak 1
and 1
ill 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
i 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
before 1
telling 1
my 1
story 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
past 1
six 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
first 1
to 1
have 1
my 1
wound 1
dressed 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
along 1
here 1
i 1
put 1
the 1
case 1
into 1
your 1
hands 1
and 1
shall 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
you 1
advise 1
we 1
both 1
sat 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
after 1
listening 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
narrative 1
then 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
pulled 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
shelf 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
ponderous 1
commonplace 1
books 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
cuttings 1
here 1
is 1
an 1
advertisement 1
which 1
will 1
interest 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
appeared 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
papers 1
about 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
listen 1
to 1
this 1
lost 1
on 1
the 1
9th 1
inst 1
mr 1
jeremiah 1
hayling 1
aged 1
twentysix 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
left 1
his 1
lodgings 1
at 1
ten 1
oclock 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
heard 1
of 1
since 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
etc 1
etc 1
ha 1
that 1
represents 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
colonel 1
needed 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
machine 1
overhauled 1
i 1
fancy 1
good 1
heavens 1
cried 1
my 1
patient 1
then 1
that 1
explains 1
what 1
the 1
girl 1
said 1
undoubtedly 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
colonel 1
was 1
a 1
cool 1
and 1
desperate 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
absolutely 1
determined 1
that 1
nothing 1
should 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
game 1
like 1
those 1
outandout 1
pirates 1
who 1
will 1
leave 1
no 1
survivor 1
from 1
a 1
captured 1
ship 1
well 1
every 1
moment 1
now 1
is 1
precious 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
feel 1
equal 1
to 1
it 1
we 1
shall 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
scotland 1
yard 1
at 1
once 1
as 1
a 1
preliminary 1
to 1
starting 1
for 1
eyford 1
some 1
three 1
hours 1
or 1
so 1
afterwards 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
train 1
together 1
bound 1
from 1
reading 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
berkshire 1
village 1
there 1
were 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
the 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
inspector 1
bradstreet 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
a 1
plainclothes 1
man 1
and 1
myself 1
bradstreet 1
had 1
spread 1
an 1
ordnance 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
county 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
seat 1
and 1
was 1
busy 1
with 1
his 1
compasses 1
drawing 1
a 1
circle 1
with 1
eyford 1
for 1
its 1
centre 1
there 1
you 1
are 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
circle 1
is 1
drawn 1
at 1
a 1
radius 1
of 1
ten 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
place 1
we 1
want 1
must 1
be 1
somewhere 1
near 1
that 1
line 1
you 1
said 1
ten 1
miles 1
i 1
think 1
sir 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
hours 1
good 1
drive 1
and 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
brought 1
you 1
back 1
all 1
that 1
way 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
unconscious 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
confused 1
memory 1
too 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
lifted 1
and 1
conveyed 1
somewhere 1
what 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
said 1
i 1
is 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
spared 1
you 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
you 1
lying 1
fainting 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
perhaps 1
the 1
villain 1
was 1
softened 1
by 1
the 1
womans 1
entreaties 1
i 1
hardly 1
think 1
that 1
likely 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
more 1
inexorable 1
face 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
oh 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
clear 1
up 1
all 1
that 1
said 1
bradstreet 1
well 1
i 1
have 1
drawn 1
my 1
circle 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
wish 1
i 1
knew 1
at 1
what 1
point 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
folk 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
could 1
lay 1
my 1
finger 1
on 1
it 1
said 1
holmes 1
quietly 1
really 1
now 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
you 1
have 1
formed 1
your 1
opinion 1
come 1
now 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
who 1
agrees 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
south 1
for 1
the 1
country 1
is 1
more 1
deserted 1
there 1
and 1
i 1
say 1
east 1
said 1
my 1
patient 1
i 1
am 1
for 1
west 1
remarked 1
the 1
plainclothes 1
man 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
quiet 1
little 1
villages 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
for 1
north 1
said 1
i 1
because 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
hills 1
there 1
and 1
our 1
friend 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
notice 1
the 1
carriage 1
go 1
up 1
any 1
come 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
laughing 1
its 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
diversity 1
of 1
opinion 1
we 1
have 1
boxed 1
the 1
compass 1
among 1
us 1
who 1
do 1
you 1
give 1
your 1
casting 1
vote 1
to 1
you 1
are 1
all 1
wrong 1
but 1
we 1
cant 1
all 1
be 1
oh 1
yes 1
you 1
can 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
point 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
finger 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
this 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
find 1
them 1
but 1
the 1
twelvemile 1
drive 1
gasped 1
hatherley 1
six 1
out 1
and 1
six 1
back 1
nothing 1
simpler 1
you 1
say 1
yourself 1
that 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
fresh 1
and 1
glossy 1
when 1
you 1
got 1
in 1
how 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
twelve 1
miles 1
over 1
heavy 1
roads 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
likely 1
ruse 1
enough 1
observed 1
bradstreet 1
thoughtfully 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
this 1
gang 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
holmes 1
they 1
are 1
coiners 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
scale 1
and 1
have 1
used 1
the 1
machine 1
to 1
form 1
the 1
amalgam 1
which 1
has 1
taken 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
silver 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
that 1
a 1
clever 1
gang 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
turning 1
out 1
halfcrowns 1
by 1
the 1
thousand 1
we 1
even 1
traced 1
them 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
reading 1
but 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
farther 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
covered 1
their 1
traces 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
showed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
very 1
old 1
hands 1
but 1
now 1
thanks 1
to 1
this 1
lucky 1
chance 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
them 1
right 1
enough 1
but 1
the 1
inspector 1
was 1
mistaken 1
for 1
those 1
criminals 1
were 1
not 1
destined 1
to 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
justice 1
as 1
we 1
rolled 1
into 1
eyford 1
station 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
gigantic 1
column 1
of 1
smoke 1
which 1
streamed 1
up 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
small 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
hung 1
like 1
an 1
immense 1
ostrich 1
feather 1
over 1
the 1
landscape 1
a 1
house 1
on 1
fire 1
asked 1
bradstreet 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
steamed 1
off 1
again 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
yes 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
stationmaster 1
when 1
did 1
it 1
break 1
out 1
i 1
hear 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
sir 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
got 1
worse 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
blaze 1
whose 1
house 1
is 1
it 1
dr 1
bechers 1
tell 1
me 1
broke 1
in 1
the 1
engineer 1
is 1
dr 1
becher 1
a 1
german 1
very 1
thin 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
sharp 1
nose 1
the 1
stationmaster 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
no 1
sir 1
dr 1
becher 1
is 1
an 1
englishman 1
and 1
there 1
isnt 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
parish 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
betterlined 1
waistcoat 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
gentleman 1
staying 1
with 1
him 1
a 1
patient 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
who 1
is 1
a 1
foreigner 1
and 1
he 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
good 1
berkshire 1
beef 1
would 1
do 1
him 1
no 1
harm 1
the 1
stationmaster 1
had 1
not 1
finished 1
his 1
speech 1
before 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
hastening 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
the 1
road 1
topped 1
a 1
low 1
hill 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
widespread 1
whitewashed 1
building 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
spouting 1
fire 1
at 1
every 1
chink 1
and 1
window 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
in 1
front 1
three 1
fireengines 1
were 1
vainly 1
striving 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
flames 1
under 1
thats 1
it 1
cried 1
hatherley 1
in 1
intense 1
excitement 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
graveldrive 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
rosebushes 1
where 1
i 1
lay 1
that 1
second 1
window 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
i 1
jumped 1
from 1
well 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
holmes 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
your 1
revenge 1
upon 1
them 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
oillamp 1
which 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
crushed 1
in 1
the 1
press 1
set 1
fire 1
to 1
the 1
wooden 1
walls 1
though 1
no 1
doubt 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
excited 1
in 1
the 1
chase 1
after 1
you 1
to 1
observe 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
now 1
keep 1
your 1
eyes 1
open 1
in 1
this 1
crowd 1
for 1
your 1
friends 1
of 1
last 1
night 1
though 1
i 1
very 1
much 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
good 1
hundred 1
miles 1
off 1
by 1
now 1
and 1
holmes 1
fears 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
realised 1
for 1
from 1
that 1
day 1
to 1
this 1
no 1
word 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
heard 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
the 1
sinister 1
german 1
or 1
the 1
morose 1
englishman 1
early 1
that 1
morning 1
a 1
peasant 1
had 1
met 1
a 1
cart 1
containing 1
several 1
people 1
and 1
some 1
very 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
driving 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
reading 1
but 1
there 1
all 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
fugitives 1
disappeared 1
and 1
even 1
holmes 1
ingenuity 1
failed 1
ever 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
least 1
clue 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
whereabouts 1
the 1
firemen 1
had 1
been 1
much 1
perturbed 1
at 1
the 1
strange 1
arrangements 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
within 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
so 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
newly 1
severed 1
human 1
thumb 1
upon 1
a 1
windowsill 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
about 1
sunset 1
however 1
their 1
efforts 1
were 1
at 1
last 1
successful 1
and 1
they 1
subdued 1
the 1
flames 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
the 1
roof 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
such 1
absolute 1
ruin 1
that 1
save 1
some 1
twisted 1
cylinders 1
and 1
iron 1
piping 1
not 1
a 1
trace 1
remained 1
of 1
the 1
machinery 1
which 1
had 1
cost 1
our 1
unfortunate 1
acquaintance 1
so 1
dearly 1
large 1
masses 1
of 1
nickel 1
and 1
of 1
tin 1
were 1
discovered 1
stored 1
in 1
an 1
outhouse 1
but 1
no 1
coins 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
explained 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
those 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
already 1
referred 1
to 1
how 1
our 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
had 1
been 1
conveyed 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
recovered 1
his 1
senses 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
forever 1
a 1
mystery 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
soft 1
mould 1
which 1
told 1
us 1
a 1
very 1
plain 1
tale 1
he 1
had 1
evidently 1
been 1
carried 1
down 1
by 1
two 1
persons 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
had 1
remarkably 1
small 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
unusually 1
large 1
ones 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
probable 1
that 1
the 1
silent 1
englishman 1
being 1
less 1
bold 1
or 1
less 1
murderous 1
than 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
assisted 1
the 1
woman 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
unconscious 1
man 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
danger 1
well 1
said 1
our 1
engineer 1
ruefully 1
as 1
we 1
took 1
our 1
seats 1
to 1
return 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
london 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
pretty 1
business 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
thumb 1
and 1

said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
indirectly 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
value 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
only 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
words 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
excellent 1
company 1
for 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
your 1
existence 1
x 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
bachelor 1
the 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
marriage 1
and 1
its 1
curious 1
termination 1
have 1
long 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
subject 1
of 1
interest 1
in 1
those 1
exalted 1
circles 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
bridegroom 1
moves 1
fresh 1
scandals 1
have 1
eclipsed 1
it 1
and 1
their 1
more 1
piquant 1
details 1
have 1
drawn 1
the 1
gossips 1
away 1
from 1
this 1
fouryearold 1
drama 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
full 1
facts 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
revealed 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
friend 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
share 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
no 1
memoir 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
be 1
complete 1
without 1
some 1
little 1
sketch 1
of 1
this 1
remarkable 1
episode 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
before 1
my 1
own 1
marriage 1
during 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
sharing 1
rooms 1
with 1
holmes 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
from 1
an 1
afternoon 1
stroll 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
remained 1
indoors 1
all 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
weather 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
sudden 1
turn 1
to 1
rain 1
with 1
high 1
autumnal 1
winds 1
and 1
the 1
jezail 1
bullet 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
back 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
as 1
a 1
relic 1
of 1
my 1
afghan 1
campaign 1
throbbed 1
with 1
dull 1
persistence 1
with 1
my 1
body 1
in 1
one 1
easychair 1
and 1
my 1
legs 1
upon 1
another 1
i 1
had 1
surrounded 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
newspapers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
saturated 1
with 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
tossed 1
them 1
all 1
aside 1
and 1
lay 1
listless 1
watching 1
the 1
huge 1
crest 1
and 1
monogram 1
upon 1
the 1
envelope 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wondering 1
lazily 1
who 1
my 1
friends 1
noble 1
correspondent 1
could 1
be 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
fashionable 1
epistle 1
i 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
your 1
morning 1
letters 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right 1
were 1
from 1
a 1
fishmonger 1
and 1
a 1
tidewaiter 1
yes 1
my 1
correspondence 1
has 1
certainly 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
variety 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
and 1
the 1
humbler 1
are 1
usually 1
the 1
more 1
interesting 1
this 1
looks 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
unwelcome 1
social 1
summonses 1
which 1
call 1
upon 1
a 1
man 1
either 1
to 1
be 1
bored 1
or 1
to 1
lie 1
he 1
broke 1
the 1
seal 1
and 1
glanced 1
over 1
the 1
contents 1
oh 1
come 1
it 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
after 1
all 1
not 1
social 1
then 1
no 1
distinctly 1
professional 1
and 1
from 1
a 1
noble 1
client 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
in 1
england 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
watson 1
without 1
affectation 1
that 1
the 1
status 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
less 1
moment 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
his 1
case 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
however 1
that 1
that 1
also 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
wanting 1
in 1
this 1
new 1
investigation 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
reading 1
the 1
papers 1
diligently 1
of 1
late 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
it 1
looks 1
like 1
it 1
said 1
i 1
ruefully 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
huge 1
bundle 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
is 1
fortunate 1
for 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
post 1
me 1
up 1
i 1
read 1
nothing 1
except 1
the 1
criminal 1
news 1
and 1
the 1
agony 1
column 1
the 1
latter 1
is 1
always 1
instructive 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
followed 1
recent 1
events 1
so 1
closely 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
read 1
about 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
and 1
his 1
wedding 1
oh 1
yes 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
interest 1
that 1
is 1
well 1
the 1
letter 1
which 1
i 1
hold 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
is 1
from 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
i 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
return 1
you 1
must 1
turn 1
over 1
these 1
papers 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
whatever 1
bears 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
my 1
dear 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmeslord 1
backwater 1
tells 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
place 1
implicit 1
reliance 1
upon 1
your 1
judgment 1
and 1
discretion 1
i 1
have 1
determined 1
therefore 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
in 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
painful 1
event 1
which 1
has 1
occurred 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
my 1
wedding 1
mr 1
lestrade 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
is 1
acting 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
he 1
assures 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
sees 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
your 1
cooperation 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
even 1
thinks 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
assistance 1
i 1
will 1
call 1
at 1
four 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
should 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
other 1
engagement 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
postpone 1
it 1
as 1
this 1
matter 1
is 1
of 1
paramount 1
importance 1
yours 1
faithfully 1
st 1
simon 1
it 1
is 1
dated 1
from 1
grosvenor 1
mansions 1
written 1
with 1
a 1
quill 1
pen 1
and 1
the 1
noble 1
lord 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
smear 1
of 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
outer 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
right 1
little 1
finger 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
as 1
he 1
folded 1
up 1
the 1
epistle 1
he 1
says 1
four 1
oclock 1
it 1
is 1
three 1
now 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
then 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
time 1
with 1
your 1
assistance 1
to 1
get 1
clear 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
turn 1
over 1
those 1
papers 1
and 1
arrange 1
the 1
extracts 1
in 1
their 1
order 1
of 1
time 1
while 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
glance 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
our 1
client 1
is 1
he 1
picked 1
a 1

from 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
books 1
of 1
reference 1
beside 1
the 1

well 1
there 1

nothing 1
very 1
instructive 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
turn 1
to 1
you 1
watson 1
for 1
something 1
more 1
solid 1
i 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
difficulty 1
in 1
finding 1
what 1

said 1
i 1
for 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
quite 1
recent 1

the 1
matter 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
remarkable 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
refer 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
however 1
as 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
an 1
inquiry 1
on 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
disliked 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
other 1
matters 1
oh 1
you 1
mean 1
the 1
little 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
grosvenor 1
square 1
furniture 1
van 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
cleared 1
up 1
nowthough 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
pray 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
your 1
newspaper 1
selections 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
notice 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
find 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
personal 1
column 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
post 1
and 1
dates 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
some 1
weeks 1
back 1
a 1
marriage 1
has 1
been 1
arranged 1
it 1
says 1
and 1
will 1
if 1
rumour 1
is 1
correct 1
very 1
shortly 1
take 1
place 1
between 1
lord 1
robert 1
st 1

the 1
only 1
daughter 1
of 1

esq 1
of 1
san 1
francisco 1
cal 1
usa 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
terse 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
stretching 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
paragraph 1
amplifying 1
this 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
papers 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
week 1
ah 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
there 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
a 1
call 1
for 1
protection 1
in 1
the 1
marriage 1
market 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
freetrade 1
principle 1
appears 1
to 1
tell 1
heavily 1
against 1
our 1
home 1
product 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
houses 1
of 1
great 1
britain 1
is 1
passing 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
our 1
fair 1
cousins 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
atlantic 1
an 1
important 1
addition 1
has 1
been 1
made 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
week 1
to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
prizes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
these 1
charming 1
invaders 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
who 1
has 1
shown 1
himself 1
for 1
over 1
twenty 1
years 1
proof 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
gods 1
arrows 1
has 1
now 1
definitely 1
announced 1
his 1
approaching 1
marriage 1
with 1
miss 1
hatty 1
doran 1
the 1
fascinating 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
california 1
millionaire 1
miss 1
doran 1
whose 1
graceful 1
figure 1
and 1
striking 1
face 1
attracted 1
much 1
attention 1
at 1
the 1
westbury 1
house 1
festivities 1
is 1
an 1
only 1
child 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
currently 1
reported 1
that 1
her 1
dowry 1
will 1
run 1
to 1
considerably 1
over 1
the 1
six 1
figures 1
with 1
expectancies 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
open 1
secret 1
that 1
the 1
duke 1
of 1
balmoral 1
has 1
been 1
compelled 1
to 1
sell 1
his 1
pictures 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
as 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
has 1
no 1
property 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
save 1
the 1
small 1
estate 1
of 1
birchmoor 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
the 1
californian 1
heiress 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
gainer 1
by 1
an 1
alliance 1
which 1
will 1
enable 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
easy 1
and 1
common 1
transition 1
from 1
a 1
republican 1
lady 1
to 1
a 1
british 1
peeress 1
anything 1
else 1
asked 1
holmes 1
yawning 1
oh 1
yes 1
plenty 1
then 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
note 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
post 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
marriage 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
absolutely 1
quiet 1
one 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
st 1
georges 1
hanover 1
square 1
that 1
only 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
intimate 1
friends 1
would 1
be 1
invited 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
party 1
would 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
furnished 1
house 1
at 1
lancaster 1
gate 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
taken 1
by 1
mr 1
aloysius 1
doran 1
two 1
days 1
laterthat 1
is 1
on 1
wednesday 1
lastthere 1
is 1
a 1
curt 1
announcement 1
that 1
the 1
wedding 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
would 1
be 1
passed 1
at 1
lord 1
backwaters 1
place 1
near 1
petersfield 1
those 1
are 1
all 1
the 1
notices 1
which 1
appeared 1
before 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
before 1
the 1
what 1
asked 1
holmes 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
the 1
vanishing 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
when 1
did 1
she 1
vanish 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
wedding 1
breakfast 1
indeed 1
this 1
is 1
more 1
interesting 1
than 1
it 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
dramatic 1
in 1
fact 1
yes 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
little 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
they 1
often 1
vanish 1
before 1
the 1
ceremony 1
and 1
occasionally 1
during 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
call 1
to 1
mind 1
anything 1
quite 1
so 1
prompt 1
as 1
this 1
pray 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
details 1
i 1
warn 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
incomplete 1
perhaps 1
we 1
may 1
make 1
them 1
less 1
so 1
such 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
they 1
are 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
article 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
paper 1
of 1
yesterday 1
which 1
i 1
will 1
read 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
headed 1
singular 1
occurrence 1
at 1
a 1
fashionable 1
wedding 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
lord 1
robert 1
st 1
simon 1
has 1
been 1
thrown 1
into 1
the 1
greatest 1
consternation 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
and 1
painful 1
episodes 1
which 1
have 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
his 1
wedding 1
the 1
ceremony 1
as 1
shortly 1
announced 1
in 1
the 1
papers 1
of 1
yesterday 1
occurred 1
on 1
the 1
previous 1
morning 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
possible 1
to 1
confirm 1
the 1
strange 1
rumours 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
persistently 1
floating 1
about 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
attempts 1
of 1
the 1
friends 1
to 1
hush 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
so 1
much 1
public 1
attention 1
has 1
now 1
been 1
drawn 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
no 1
good 1
purpose 1
can 1
be 1
served 1
by 1
affecting 1
to 1
disregard 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
common 1
subject 1
for 1
conversation 1
the 1
ceremony 1
which 1
was 1
performed 1
at 1
st 1
georges 1
hanover 1
square 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
quiet 1
one 1
no 1
one 1
being 1
present 1
save 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
mr 1
aloysius 1
doran 1
the 1
duchess 1
of 1
balmoral 1
lord 1
backwater 1
lord 1
eustace 1
and 1
lady 1
clara 1
st 1
simon 1
the 1
younger 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
and 1
lady 1
alicia 1
whittington 1
the 1
whole 1
party 1
proceeded 1
afterwards 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mr 1
aloysius 1
doran 1
at 1
lancaster 1
gate 1
where 1
breakfast 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
it 1
appears 1
that 1
some 1
little 1
trouble 1
was 1
caused 1
by 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
name 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
ascertained 1
who 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
after 1
the 1
bridal 1
party 1
alleging 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
claim 1
upon 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
after 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
prolonged 1
scene 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
ejected 1
by 1
the 1
butler 1
and 1
the 1
footman 1
the 1
bride 1
who 1
had 1
fortunately 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
before 1
this 1
unpleasant 1
interruption 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
when 1
she 1
complained 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
indisposition 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
her 1
prolonged 1
absence 1
having 1
caused 1
some 1
comment 1
her 1
father 1
followed 1
her 1
but 1
learned 1
from 1
her 1
maid 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
only 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
chamber 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
caught 1
up 1
an 1
ulster 1
and 1
bonnet 1
and 1
hurried 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
passage 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
declared 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
lady 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
thus 1
apparelled 1
but 1
had 1
refused 1
to 1
credit 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mistress 1
believing 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
the 1
company 1
on 1
ascertaining 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
disappeared 1
mr 1
aloysius 1
doran 1
in 1
conjunction 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
instantly 1
put 1
themselves 1
in 1
communication 1
with 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
very 1
energetic 1
inquiries 1
are 1
being 1
made 1
which 1
will 1
probably 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
speedy 1
clearing 1
up 1
of 1
this 1
very 1
singular 1
business 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
late 1
hour 1
last 1
night 1
however 1
nothing 1
had 1
transpired 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
lady 1
there 1
are 1
rumours 1
of 1
foul 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
caused 1
the 1
arrest 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
original 1
disturbance 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
from 1
jealousy 1
or 1
some 1
other 1
motive 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
strange 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
only 1
one 1
little 1
item 1
in 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
suggestive 1
one 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
miss 1
flora 1
millar 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
disturbance 1
has 1
actually 1
been 1
arrested 1
it 1
appears 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
formerly 1
a 1
danseuse 1
at 1
the 1
allegro 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
known 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
further 1
particulars 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
case 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
hands 1
nowso 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
press 1
and 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
interesting 1
case 1
it 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
worlds 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
watson 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
makes 1
it 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
four 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
noble 1
client 1
do 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
going 1
watson 1
for 1
i 1
very 1
much 1
prefer 1
having 1
a 1
witness 1
if 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
check 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
memory 1
lord 1
robert 1
st 1
simon 1
announced 1
our 1
pageboy 1
throwing 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
gentleman 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
cultured 1
face 1
highnosed 1
and 1
pale 1
with 1
something 1
perhaps 1
of 1
petulance 1
about 1
the 1
mouth 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
steady 1
wellopened 1
eye 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
pleasant 1
lot 1
it 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
to 1
command 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
obeyed 1
his 1
manner 1
was 1
brisk 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
general 1
appearance 1
gave 1
an 1
undue 1
impression 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
slight 1
forward 1
stoop 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
bend 1
of 1
the 1
knees 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
his 1
hair 1
too 1
as 1
he 1
swept 1
off 1
his 1
very 1
curlybrimmed 1
hat 1
was 1
grizzled 1
round 1
the 1
edges 1
and 1
thin 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
dress 1
it 1
was 1
careful 1
to 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
foppishness 1
with 1
high 1
collar 1
black 1
frockcoat 1
white 1
waistcoat 1
yellow 1
gloves 1
patentleather 1
shoes 1
and 1
lightcoloured 1
gaiters 1
he 1
advanced 1
slowly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
turning 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
left 1
to 1
right 1
and 1
swinging 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
the 1
cord 1
which 1
held 1
his 1
golden 1
eyeglasses 1
goodday 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
said 1
holmes 1
rising 1
and 1
bowing 1
pray 1
take 1
the 1
basketchair 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
dr 1
watson 1
draw 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
talk 1
this 1
matter 1
over 1
a 1
most 1
painful 1
matter 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
most 1
readily 1
imagine 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
quick 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
managed 1
several 1
delicate 1
cases 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
sir 1
though 1
i 1
presume 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
hardly 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
class 1
of 1
society 1
no 1
i 1
am 1
descending 1
i 1
beg 1
pardon 1
my 1
last 1
client 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
oh 1
really 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
and 1
which 1
king 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
scandinavia 1
what 1
had 1
he 1
lost 1
his 1
wife 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
said 1
holmes 1
suavely 1
that 1
i 1
extend 1
to 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
my 1
other 1
clients 1
the 1
same 1
secrecy 1
which 1
i 1
promise 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
yours 1
of 1
course 1
very 1
right 1
very 1
right 1
im 1
sure 1
i 1
beg 1
pardon 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
case 1
i 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
information 1
which 1
may 1
assist 1
you 1
in 1
forming 1
an 1
opinion 1
thank 1
you 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
learned 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
prints 1
nothing 1
more 1
i 1
presume 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
as 1
correctthis 1
article 1
for 1
example 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
glanced 1
over 1
it 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
correct 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
goes 1
but 1
it 1
needs 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
supplementing 1
before 1
anyone 1
could 1
offer 1
an 1
opinion 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
arrive 1
at 1
my 1
facts 1
most 1
directly 1
by 1
questioning 1
you 1
pray 1
do 1
so 1
when 1
did 1
you 1
first 1
meet 1
miss 1
hatty 1
doran 1
in 1
san 1
francisco 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
you 1
were 1
travelling 1
in 1
the 1
states 1
yes 1
did 1
you 1
become 1
engaged 1
then 1
no 1
but 1
you 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
i 1
was 1
amused 1
by 1
her 1
society 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
amused 1
her 1
father 1
is 1
very 1
rich 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
richest 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
pacific 1
slope 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
make 1
his 1
money 1
in 1
mining 1
he 1
had 1
nothing 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
then 1
he 1
struck 1
gold 1
invested 1
it 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
by 1
leaps 1
and 1
bounds 1
now 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
impression 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
ladysyour 1
wifes 1
character 1
the 1
nobleman 1
swung 1
his 1
glasses 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
and 1
stared 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
you 1
see 1
mr 1
holmes 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
twenty 1
before 1
her 1
father 1
became 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
she 1
ran 1
free 1
in 1
a 1
mining 1
camp 1
and 1
wandered 1
through 1
woods 1
or 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
education 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
nature 1
rather 1
than 1
from 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
she 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
in 1
england 1
a 1
tomboy 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
nature 1
wild 1
and 1
free 1
unfettered 1
by 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
traditions 1
she 1
is 1
impetuousvolcanic 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
say 1
she 1
is 1
swift 1
in 1
making 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
and 1
fearless 1
in 1
carrying 1
out 1
her 1
resolutions 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
her 1
the 1
name 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
bearhe 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
stately 1
coughhad 1
not 1
i 1
thought 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
bottom 1
a 1
noble 1
woman 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
capable 1
of 1
heroic 1
selfsacrifice 1
and 1
that 1
anything 1
dishonourable 1
would 1
be 1
repugnant 1
to 1
her 1
have 1
you 1
her 1
photograph 1
i 1
brought 1
this 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
opened 1
a 1
locket 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
full 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
lovely 1
woman 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
photograph 1
but 1
an 1
ivory 1
miniature 1
and 1
the 1
artist 1
had 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
full 1
effect 1
of 1
the 1
lustrous 1
black 1
hair 1
the 1
large 1
dark 1
eyes 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
mouth 1
holmes 1
gazed 1
long 1
and 1
earnestly 1
at 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
locket 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
to 1
london 1
then 1
and 1
you 1
renewed 1
your 1
acquaintance 1
yes 1
her 1
father 1
brought 1
her 1
over 1
for 1
this 1
last 1
london 1
season 1
i 1
met 1
her 1
several 1
times 1
became 1
engaged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
now 1
married 1
her 1
she 1
brought 1
i 1
understand 1
a 1
considerable 1
dowry 1
a 1
fair 1
dowry 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
is 1
usual 1
in 1
my 1
family 1
and 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
remains 1
to 1
you 1
since 1
the 1
marriage 1
is 1
a 1
fait 1
accompli 1
i 1
really 1
have 1
made 1
no 1
inquiries 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
very 1
naturally 1
not 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
miss 1
doran 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
the 1
wedding 1
yes 1
was 1
she 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
never 1
better 1
she 1
kept 1
talking 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
in 1
our 1
future 1
lives 1
indeed 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
interesting 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
she 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
possibleat 1
least 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
ceremony 1
