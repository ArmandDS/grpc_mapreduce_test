quite 1
exploded 1
lady 1
bracknell 1

was 1
he 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
revolutionary 1
outrage 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
social 1
legislation 1
if 1

is 1
what 1
i 1
meanso 1
bunbury 1
died 1
lady 1
bracknell 1

seems 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
great 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
opinion 1
of 1
his 1
physicians 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
however 1
that 1
he 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
to 1
some 1
definite 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
and 1
acted 1
under 1
proper 1
medical 1
advice 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
finally 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
this 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
mr 1
worthing 1
who 1
is 1
that 1
young 1
person 1
whose 1
hand 1
my 1
nephew 1
algernon 1
is 1
now 1
holding 1
in 1
what 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
unnecessary 1
manner 1
jack 1
that 1
lady 1
is 1
miss 1
cecily 1
cardew 1
my 1
ward 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
bows 1
coldly 1
to 1
cecily 1
algernon 1
i 1
am 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
cecily 1
aunt 1

i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1

and 1
i 1
are 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
with 1
a 1
shiver 1
crossing 1
to 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
peculiarly 1
exciting 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
part 1
of 1
hertfordshire 1
but 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
engagements 1
that 1
go 1
on 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
considerably 1
above 1
the 1
proper 1
average 1
that 1
statistics 1
have 1
laid 1
down 1
for 1
our 1
guidance 1
i 1
think 1
some 1
preliminary 1
inquiry 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
mr 1
worthing 1
is 1
miss 1
cardew 1
at 1
all 1
connected 1
with 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
railway 1
stations 1
in 1
london 1
i 1
merely 1
desire 1
information 1
until 1
yesterday 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
families 1
or 1
persons 1
whose 1
origin 1
was 1
a 1
terminus 1
jack 1
looks 1
perfectly 1
furious 1
but 1
restrains 1
himself 1
jack 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
cold 1

unsatisfactory 1

confidence 1

in 1

what 1
proof 1

i 1
of 1

lady 1
bracknell 1
ah 1
a 1
life 1
crowded 1
with 1
incident 1
i 1
see 1
though 1
perhaps 1
somewhat 1
too 1
exciting 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
myself 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
premature 1
experiences 1
rises 1
looks 1
at 1
her 1

time 1
approaches 1
for 1
our 1

we 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
form 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
ask 1
you 1
if 1
miss 1
cardew 1
has 1
any 1
little 1
fortune 1
jack 1
oh 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
in 1
the 1
funds 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
goodbye 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
so 1
pleased 1
to 1
have 1
seen 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
sitting 1
down 1
again 1
a 1
moment 1
mr 1
worthing 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
funds 1
miss 1
cardew 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
most 1
attractive 1
young 1
lady 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
few 1
girls 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
have 1
any 1
really 1
solid 1
qualities 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
qualities 1
that 1
last 1
and 1
improve 1
with 1
time 1
we 1
live 1
i 1
regret 1
to 1
say 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
surfaces 1
to 1
cecily 1
come 1
over 1
here 1
dear 1
cecily 1
goes 1
across 1
pretty 1
child 1
your 1
dress 1
is 1
sadly 1
simple 1
and 1
your 1
hair 1
seems 1
almost 1
as 1
nature 1
might 1
have 1
left 1
it 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
soon 1
alter 1
all 1
that 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
french 1
maid 1
produces 1
a 1
really 1
marvellous 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
brief 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
i 1
remember 1
recommending 1
one 1
to 1
young 1
lady 1
lancing 1
and 1
after 1
three 1
months 1
her 1
own 1
husband 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
jack 1
and 1
after 1
six 1
months 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
glares 1
at 1
jack 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
then 1
bends 1
with 1
a 1
practised 1
smile 1
to 1
cecily 1
kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
sweet 1
child 1
cecily 1
turns 1
completely 1
round 1
no 1
the 1
side 1
view 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
cecily 1
presents 1
her 1
profile 1
yes 1
quite 1
as 1
i 1
expected 1
there 1
are 1
distinct 1
social 1
possibilities 1
in 1
your 1
profile 1
the 1
two 1
weak 1
points 1
in 1
our 1
age 1
are 1
its 1
want 1
of 1
principle 1
and 1
its 1
want 1
of 1
profile 1
the 1
chin 1
a 1
little 1
higher 1
dear 1
style 1
largely 1
depends 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
chin 1
is 1
worn 1
they 1
are 1
worn 1
very 1
high 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
algernon 1
algernon 1
yes 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
there 1
are 1
distinct 1
social 1
possibilities 1
in 1
miss 1
cardews 1
profile 1
algernon 1
cecily 1
is 1
the 1
sweetest 1
dearest 1
prettiest 1
girl 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
twopence 1
about 1
social 1
possibilities 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
never 1
speak 1
disrespectfully 1
of 1
society 1
algernon 1
only 1
people 1
who 1
cant 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
do 1
that 1
to 1
cecily 1
dear 1
child 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
algernon 1
has 1
nothing 1
but 1
his 1
debts 1
to 1
depend 1
upon 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
of 1
mercenary 1
marriages 1
when 1
i 1
married 1
lord 1
bracknell 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
fortune 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
dreamed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
allowing 1
that 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
my 1
way 1
well 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
must 1
give 1
my 1
consent 1
algernon 1
thank 1
you 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
cecily 1
you 1
may 1
kiss 1
me 1
cecily 1
kisses 1
her 1
thank 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
you 1
may 1
also 1
address 1
me 1
as 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
cecily 1
thank 1
you 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
the 1
marriage 1
i 1
think 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
place 1
quite 1
soon 1
algernon 1
thank 1
you 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
cecily 1
thank 1
you 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
to 1
speak 1
frankly 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
long 1
engagements 1
they 1
give 1
people 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
finding 1
out 1
each 1
others 1
character 1
before 1
marriage 1
which 1
i 1
think 1
is 1
never 1
advisable 1
jack 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
for 1
interrupting 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
but 1
this 1
engagement 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
i 1
am 1
miss 1
cardews 1
guardian 1
and 1
she 1
cannot 1
marry 1
without 1
my 1
consent 1
until 1
she 1
comes 1
of 1
age 1
that 1
consent 1
i 1
absolutely 1
decline 1
to 1
give 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
upon 1
what 1
grounds 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
algernon 1
is 1
an 1
extremely 1
i 1
may 1
almost 1
say 1
an 1
ostentatiously 1
eligible 1
young 1
man 1
he 1
has 1
nothing 1
but 1
he 1
looks 1
everything 1
what 1
more 1
can 1
one 1
desire 1
jack 1
it 1
pains 1
me 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
speak 1
frankly 1
to 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
about 1
your 1
nephew 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
his 1
moral 1
character 1
i 1
suspect 1
him 1
of 1
being 1
untruthful 1
algernon 1
and 1
cecily 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
indignant 1
amazement 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
untruthful 1
my 1
nephew 1
algernon 1
impossible 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
oxonian 1
jack 1
i 1
fear 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
possible 1
doubt 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
this 1
afternoon 1
during 1
my 1
temporary 1
absence 1
in 1
london 1
on 1
an 1
important 1
question 1
of 1
romance 1
he 1
obtained 1
admission 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
false 1
pretence 1
of 1
being 1
my 1
brother 1
under 1
an 1
assumed 1
name 1
he 1
drank 1
ive 1
just 1
been 1
informed 1
by 1
my 1
butler 1
an 1
entire 1
pint 1
bottle 1
of 1
my 1
perrierjouet 1
brut 1
89 1
wine 1
i 1
was 1
specially 1
reserving 1
for 1
myself 1
continuing 1
his 1
disgraceful 1
deception 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
in 1
alienating 1
the 1
affections 1
of 1
my 1
only 1
ward 1
he 1
subsequently 1
stayed 1
to 1
tea 1
and 1
devoured 1
every 1
single 1
muffin 1
and 1
what 1
makes 1
his 1
conduct 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
heartless 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
perfectly 1
well 1
aware 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
intend 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
i 1
distinctly 1
told 1
him 1
so 1
myself 1
yesterday 1
afternoon 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
ahem 1
mr 1
worthing 1
after 1
careful 1
consideration 1
i 1
have 1
decided 1
entirely 1
to 1
overlook 1
my 1
nephews 1
conduct 1
to 1
you 1
jack 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
generous 1
of 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
my 1
own 1
decision 1
however 1
is 1
unalterable 1
i 1
decline 1
to 1
give 1
my 1
consent 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
to 1
cecily 1
come 1
here 1
sweet 1
child 1
cecily 1
goes 1
over 1
how 1
old 1
are 1
you 1
dear 1
cecily 1
well 1
i 1
am 1
really 1
only 1
eighteen 1
but 1
i 1
always 1
admit 1
to 1
twenty 1
when 1
i 1
go 1
to 1
evening 1
parties 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
you 1
are 1
perfectly 1
right 1
in 1
making 1
some 1
slight 1
alteration 1
indeed 1
no 1
woman 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
quite 1
accurate 1
about 1
her 1
age 1
it 1
looks 1
so 1
calculating 1
in 1
a 1
meditative 1
manner 1
eighteen 1
but 1
admitting 1
to 1
twenty 1
at 1
evening 1
parties 1
well 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
long 1
before 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
age 1
and 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
restraints 1
of 1
tutelage 1
so 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
your 1
guardians 1
consent 1
is 1
after 1
all 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
jack 1
pray 1
excuse 1
me 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
for 1
interrupting 1
you 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
her 1
grandfathers 1
will 1
miss 1
cardew 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
legally 1
of 1
age 1
till 1
she 1
is 1
thirtyfive 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
grave 1
objection 1
thirty 1
five 1
is 1
a 1
very 1

my 1

knowledge 1

thirtyfive 1
ever 1

age 1
of 1
forty 1
which 1
was 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
our 1
dear 1

not 1
be 1
even 1
still 1
more 1
attractive 1
at 1
the 1
age 1

large 1

i 1
hate 1
waiting 1
even 1
five 1

always 1
makes 1
me 1
rather 1
cross 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
punctual 1
myself 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
like 1
punctuality 1
in 1
others 1
and 1
waiting 1
even 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1

a 1
somewhat 1
impatient 1
naturei 1
would 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
reconsider 1
your 1
decision 1
jack 1
but 1
my 1
dear 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
entirely 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
the 1
moment 1
you 1
consent 1
to 1
my 1
marriage 1
with 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
will 1
most 1
gladly 1
allow 1
your 1
nephew 1
to 1
form 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
my 1
ward 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
rising 1

drawing 1
herself 1
up 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
quite 1
aware 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
propose 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
jack 1
then 1
a 1
passionate 1
celibacy 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
destiny 1
i 1
propose 1
for 1

six 1

the 1
christenings 1
sir 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
somewhat 1
premature 1
chasuble 1
looking 1
rather 1
puzzled 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
jack 1
and 1
algernon 1
both 1
these 1
gentlemen 1
have 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
immediate 1
baptism 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
at 1
their 1
age 1
the 1
idea 1
is 1
grotesque 1
and 1
irreligious 1
algernon 1
i 1
forbid 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
baptized 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
such 1
excesses 1
lord 1
bracknell 1
would 1
be 1
highly 1
displeased 1
if 1
he 1
learned 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
wasted 1
your 1
time 1
and 1
money 1
chasuble 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
understand 1
then 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
christenings 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
afternoon 1
jack 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
that 1
as 1
things 1
are 1
now 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
of 1
much 1
practical 1
value 1
to 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
chasuble 1
i 1
am 1
grieved 1
to 1
hear 1
such 1
sentiments 1
from 1
you 1
mr 1
worthing 1
they 1
savour 1
of 1
the 1
heretical 1
views 1
of 1
the 1
anabaptists 1
views 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
completely 1
refuted 1
in 1
four 1
of 1
my 1
unpublished 1
sermons 1
however 1
as 1
your 1
present 1
mood 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
peculiarly 1
secular 1
i 1
will 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
at 1
once 1
indeed 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
been 1

me 1
to 1
detain 1
you 1

an 1
argument 1

my 1
unfortunate 1
brother 1
algy 1
you 1
young 1
scoundrel 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
with 1
more 1
respect 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
behaved 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
brother 1
in 1
all 1
your 1
life 1
algernon 1
well 1
not 1
till 1
today 1
old 1
boy 1
i 1
admit 1
i 1
did 1
my 1
best 1
however 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
practice 1
shakes 1
hands 1
gwendolen 1
to 1
jack 1
my 1
own 1
but 1
what 1
own 1
are 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
christian 1
name 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
become 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
jack 1
good 1
heavens 1
i 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
that 1
point 1
your 1
decision 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
irrevocable 1
i 1
suppose 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
never 1
change 1
except 1
in 1
my 1
affections 1
cecily 1
what 1
a 1
noble 1
nature 1
you 1
have 1
gwendolen 1
jack 1
then 1
the 1
question 1
had 1
better 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
at 1
once 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
miss 1
prism 1
left 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
handbag 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
every 1
luxury 1
that 1
money 1
could 1
buy 1
including 1
christening 1
had 1
been 1
lavished 1
on 1
you 1
by 1
your 1
fond 1
and 1
doting 1
parents 1
jack 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
christened 1
that 1
is 1
settled 1
now 1
what 1
name 1
was 1
i 1
given 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
the 1
worst 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
being 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
you 1
were 1
naturally 1
christened 1
after 1
your 1
father 1
jack 1
irritably 1
yes 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
my 1
fathers 1
christian 1
name 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
meditatively 1
i 1
cannot 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
recall 1
what 1
the 1
generals 1
christian 1
name 1
was 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
he 1
had 1
one 1
he 1
was 1
eccentric 1
i 1
admit 1
but 1
only 1
in 1
later 1
years 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
indian 1
climate 1
and 1
marriage 1
and 1
indigestion 1
and 1
other 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
jack 1
algy 1
cant 1
you 1
recollect 1
what 1
our 1
fathers 1
christian 1
name 1
was 1
algernon 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
we 1
were 1
never 1
even 1
on 1
speaking 1
terms 1
he 1
died 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
year 1
old 1
jack 1
his 1
name 1
would 1
appear 1
in 1
the 1
army 1
lists 1
of 1
the 1
period 1
i 1
suppose 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
the 1
general 1
was 1
essentially 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
peace 1
except 1
in 1
his 1
domestic 1
life 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
his 1
name 1
would 1
appear 1
in 1
any 1
military 1
directory 1
jack 1
the 1
army 1
lists 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
forty 1
years 1
are 1
here 1

now 1
that 1

knew 1
i 1

some 1
particular 1
reason 1
for 1

that 1
you 1
could 1
have 1
no 1
other 1
name 1
jack 1
gwendolen 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
thing 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
suddenly 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
speaking 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
truth 1
can 1
you 1
forgive 1
me 1
gwendolen 1

you 1
observe 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
then 1
well 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
i 1
saw 1
then 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
that 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
sharp 1
the 1
incident 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
trivial 1
to 1
relate 1
and 1
can 1
have 1
no 1
possible 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
pray 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
childish 1
she 1
dropped 1
her 1
bouquet 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
vestry 1
she 1
was 1
passing 1
the 1
front 1
pew 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
into 1
the 1
pew 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
moments 1
delay 1
but 1
the 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
handed 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
the 1
fall 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
she 1
answered 1
me 1
abruptly 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
home 1
she 1
seemed 1
absurdly 1
agitated 1
over 1
this 1
trifling 1
cause 1
indeed 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
were 1
present 1
then 1
oh 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
exclude 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
church 1
is 1
open 1
this 1
gentleman 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
wifes 1
friends 1
no 1
no 1
i 1
call 1
him 1
a 1
gentleman 1
by 1
courtesy 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
commonlooking 1
person 1
i 1
hardly 1
noticed 1
his 1
appearance 1
but 1
really 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
wandering 1
rather 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
lady 1
st 1
simon 1
then 1
returned 1
from 1
the 1
wedding 1
in 1
a 1
less 1
cheerful 1
frame 1
of 1
mind 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
it 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
do 1
on 1
reentering 1
her 1
fathers 1
house 1
i 1
saw 1
her 1
in 1
conversation 1
with 1
her 1
maid 1
and 1
who 1
is 1
her 1
maid 1
alice 1
is 1
her 1
name 1
she 1
is 1
an 1
american 1
and 1
came 1
from 1
california 1
with 1
her 1
a 1
confidential 1
servant 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
so 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
her 1
mistress 1
allowed 1
her 1
to 1
take 1
great 1
liberties 1
still 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
america 1
they 1
look 1
upon 1
these 1
things 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
way 1
how 1
long 1
did 1
she 1
speak 1
to 1
this 1
alice 1
oh 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
else 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
overhear 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
lady 1
st 1
simon 1
said 1
something 1
about 1
jumping 1
a 1
claim 1
she 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
use 1
slang 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
american 1
slang 1
is 1
very 1
expressive 1
sometimes 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
your 1
wife 1
do 1
when 1
she 1
finished 1
speaking 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
she 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
breakfastroom 1
on 1
your 1
arm 1
no 1
alone 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
independent 1
in 1
little 1
matters 1
like 1
that 1
then 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
or 1
so 1
she 1
rose 1
hurriedly 1
muttered 1
some 1
words 1
of 1
apology 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
but 1
this 1
maid 1
alice 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
deposes 1
that 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
covered 1
her 1
brides 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
ulster 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
bonnet 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
quite 1
so 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
afterwards 1
seen 1
walking 1
into 1
hyde 1
park 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
flora 1
millar 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
custody 1
and 1
who 1
had 1
already 1
made 1
a 1
disturbance 1
at 1
mr 1
dorans 1
house 1
that 1
morning 1
ah 1
yes 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
a 1
few 1
particulars 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
relations 1
to 1
her 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
for 1
some 1
yearsi 1
may 1
say 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
friendly 1
footing 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
allegro 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
treated 1
her 1
ungenerously 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
just 1
cause 1
of 1
complaint 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
women 1
are 1
mr 1
holmes 1
flora 1
was 1
a 1
dear 1
little 1
thing 1
but 1
exceedingly 1
hotheaded 1
and 1
devotedly 1
attached 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
wrote 1
me 1
dreadful 1
letters 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
marriage 1
celebrated 1
so 1
quietly 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
feared 1
lest 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
scandal 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
mr 1
dorans 1
door 1
just 1
after 1
we 1
returned 1
and 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
push 1
her 1
way 1
in 1
uttering 1
very 1
abusive 1
expressions 1
towards 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
even 1
threatening 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
foreseen 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
two 1
police 1
fellows 1
there 1
in 1
private 1
clothes 1
who 1
soon 1
pushed 1
her 1
out 1
again 1
she 1
was 1
quiet 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
good 1
in 1
making 1
a 1
row 1
did 1
your 1
wife 1
hear 1
all 1
this 1
no 1
thank 1
goodness 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
seen 1
walking 1
with 1
this 1
very 1
woman 1
afterwards 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
mr 1
lestrade 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
looks 1
upon 1
as 1
so 1
serious 1
it 1
is 1
thought 1
that 1
flora 1
decoyed 1
my 1
wife 1
out 1
and 1
laid 1
some 1
terrible 1
trap 1
for 1
her 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
supposition 1
you 1
think 1
so 1
too 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
probable 1
one 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
yourself 1
look 1
upon 1
this 1
as 1
likely 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
flora 1
would 1
hurt 1
a 1
fly 1
still 1
jealousy 1
is 1
a 1
strange 1
transformer 1
of 1
characters 1
pray 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
theory 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
took 1
place 1
well 1
really 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
theory 1
not 1
to 1
propound 1
one 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
since 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
however 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
this 1
affair 1
the 1
consciousness 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
so 1
immense 1
a 1
social 1
stride 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
causing 1
some 1
little 1
nervous 1
disturbance 1
in 1
my 1
wife 1
in 1
short 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
suddenly 1
deranged 1
well 1
really 1
when 1
i 1
consider 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
turned 1
her 1
backi 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
upon 1
me 1
but 1
upon 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
many 1
have 1
aspired 1
to 1
without 1
successi 1
can 1
hardly 1
explain 1
it 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
fashion 1
well 1
certainly 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
conceivable 1
hypothesis 1
said 1
holmes 1
smiling 1
and 1
now 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
nearly 1
all 1
my 1
data 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
whether 1
you 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
breakfasttable 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
park 1
quite 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
need 1
to 1
detain 1
you 1
longer 1
i 1
shall 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
should 1
you 1
be 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
solve 1
this 1
problem 1
said 1
our 1
client 1
rising 1
i 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
eh 1
what 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
where 1
then 1
is 1
my 1
wife 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
detail 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
speedily 1
supply 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
wiser 1
heads 1
than 1
yours 1
or 1
mine 1
he 1
remarked 1
and 1
bowing 1
in 1
a 1
stately 1
oldfashioned 1
manner 1
he 1
departed 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
of 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
to 1
honour 1
my 1
head 1
by 1
putting 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
whisky 1
and 1
soda 1
and 1
a 1
cigar 1
after 1
all 1
this 1
crossquestioning 1
i 1
had 1
formed 1
my 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
our 1
client 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes 1
i 1
have 1
notes 1
of 1
several 1
similar 1
cases 1
though 1
none 1
as 1
i 1
remarked 1
before 1
which 1
were 1
quite 1
as 1
prompt 1
my 1
whole 1
examination 1
served 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
conjecture 1
into 1
a 1
certainty 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
is 1
occasionally 1
very 1
convincing 1
as 1
when 1
you 1
find 1
a 1
trout 1
in 1
the 1
milk 1
to 1
quote 1
thoreaus 1
example 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
without 1
however 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
preexisting 1
cases 1
which 1
serves 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
parallel 1
instance 1
in 1
aberdeen 1
some 1
years 1
back 1
and 1
something 1
on 1
very 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
lines 1
at 1
munich 1
the 1
year 1
after 1
the 1
francoprussian 1
war 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
casesbut 1
hullo 1
here 1
is 1
lestrade 1
goodafternoon 1
lestrade 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
an 1
extra 1
tumbler 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
cigars 1
in 1
the 1
box 1
the 1
official 1
detective 1
was 1
attired 1
in 1
a 1
peajacket 1
and 1
cravat 1
which 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
decidedly 1
nautical 1
appearance 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
black 1
canvas 1
bag 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
with 1
a 1
short 1
greeting 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
and 1
lit 1
the 1
cigar 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
him 1
whats 1
up 1
then 1
asked 1
holmes 1
with 1
a 1
twinkle 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
you 1
look 1
dissatisfied 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
dissatisfied 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
infernal 1
st 1
simon 1
marriage 1
case 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
neither 1
head 1
nor 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
really 1
you 1
surprise 1
me 1
who 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
mixed 1
affair 1
every 1
clue 1
seems 1
to 1
slip 1
through 1
my 1
fingers 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
it 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
very 1
wet 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
laying 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
peajacket 1
yes 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
dragging 1
the 1
serpentine 1
in 1
heavens 1
name 1
what 1
for 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
lady 1
st 1
simon 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
have 1
you 1
dragged 1
the 1
basin 1
of 1
trafalgar 1
square 1
fountain 1
he 1
asked 1
why 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
because 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
finding 1
this 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
lestrade 1
shot 1
an 1
angry 1
glance 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
snarled 1
well 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
heard 1
the 1
facts 1
but 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
oh 1
indeed 1
then 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
serpentine 1
plays 1
no 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
very 1
unlikely 1
then 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
explain 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
found 1
this 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
bag 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
tumbled 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
a 1
weddingdress 1
of 1
watered 1
silk 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
white 1
satin 1
shoes 1
and 1
a 1
brides 1
wreath 1
and 1
veil 1
all 1
discoloured 1
and 1
soaked 1
in 1
water 1
there 1
said 1
he 1
putting 1
a 1
new 1
weddingring 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
pile 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
nut 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
crack 1
master 1
holmes 1
oh 1
indeed 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
blowing 1
blue 1
rings 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
you 1
dragged 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
serpentine 1
no 1
they 1
were 1
found 1
floating 1
near 1
the 1
margin 1
by 1
a 1
parkkeeper 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
identified 1
as 1
her 1
clothes 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
there 1
the 1
body 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
far 1
off 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
brilliant 1
reasoning 1
every 1
mans 1
body 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
and 1
pray 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
through 1
this 1
at 1
some 1
evidence 1
implicating 1
flora 1
millar 1
in 1
the 1
disappearance 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
are 1
you 1
indeed 1
now 1
cried 1
lestrade 1
with 1
some 1
bitterness 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
holmes 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
practical 1
with 1
your 1
deductions 1
and 1
your 1
inferences 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
two 1
blunders 1
in 1
as 1
many 1
minutes 1
this 1
dress 1
does 1
implicate 1
miss 1
flora 1
millar 1
and 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
dress 1
is 1
a 1
pocket 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
is 1
a 1
cardcase 1
in 1
the 1
cardcase 1
is 1
a 1
note 1
and 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
he 1
slapped 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
listen 1
to 1
this 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
when 1
all 1
is 1
ready 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
fhm 1
now 1
my 1
theory 1
all 1
along 1
has 1
been 1
that 1
lady 1
st 1
simon 1
was 1
decoyed 1
away 1
by 1
flora 1
millar 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
with 1
confederates 1
no 1
doubt 1
was 1
responsible 1
for 1
her 1
disappearance 1
here 1
signed 1
with 1
her 1
initials 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
which 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
quietly 1
slipped 1
into 1
her 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
which 1
lured 1
her 1
within 1
their 1
reach 1
very 1
good 1
lestrade 1
said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
very 1
fine 1
indeed 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
a 1
listless 1
way 1
but 1
his 1
attention 1
instantly 1
became 1
riveted 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
this 1
is 1
indeed 1
important 1
said 1
he 1
ha 1
you 1
find 1
it 1
so 1
extremely 1
so 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
warmly 1
lestrade 1
rose 1
in 1
his 1
triumph 1
and 1
bent 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
look 1
why 1
he 1
shrieked 1
youre 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
wrong 1
side 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
youre 1
mad 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
note 1
written 1
in 1
pencil 1
over 1
here 1
and 1
over 1
here 1
is 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
fragment 1
of 1
a 1
hotel 1
bill 1
which 1
interests 1
me 1
deeply 1
theres 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
looked 1
at 1

most 1

all 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
note 1
it 1
is 1
important 1
also 1
or 1
at 1

the 1
initials 1
are 1
so 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
again 1
ive 1
wasted 1
time 1
enough 1
said 1
lestrade 1
rising 1
i 1
believe 1
in 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
not 1

by 1

spinning 1
fine 1
theories 1
goodday 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
which 1
gets 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
first 1
he 1
gathered 1
up 1
the 1
garments 1
thrust 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
just 1
one 1
hint 1
to 1
you 1
lestrade 1
drawled 1
holmes 1
before 1
his 1
rival 1
vanished 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
true 1
solution 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
lady 1
st 1
simon 1
is 1
a 1
myth 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
and 1
there 1
never 1
has 1
been 1
any 1
such 1
person 1
lestrade 1
looked 1
sadly 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
tapped 1
his 1
forehead 1
three 1
times 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
solemnly 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
he 1
had 1
hardly 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
when 1
holmes 1
rose 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
overcoat 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
what 1
the 1
fellow 1
says 1
about 1
outdoor 1
work 1
he 1
remarked 1
so 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
papers 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
five 1
oclock 1
when 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
left 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lonely 1
for 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
arrived 1
a 1
confectioners 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
flat 1
box 1
this 1
he 1
unpacked 1
with 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
a 1
youth 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
presently 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
great 1
astonishment 1
a 1
quite 1
epicurean 1
little 1
cold 1
supper 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
our 1
humble 1
lodginghouse 1
mahogany 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
brace 1
of 1
cold 1
woodcock 1
a 1
pheasant 1
a 1
pate 1
de 1
foie 1
gras 1
pie 1
with 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
ancient 1
and 1
cobwebby 1
bottles 1
having 1
laid 1
out 1
all 1
these 1
luxuries 1
my 1
two 1
visitors 1
vanished 1
away 1
like 1
the 1
genii 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
nights 1
with 1
no 1
explanation 1
save 1
that 1
the 1
things 1
had 1
been 1
paid 1
for 1
and 1
were 1
ordered 1
to 1
this 1
address 1
just 1
before 1
nine 1
oclock 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
stepped 1
briskly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
features 1
were 1
gravely 1
set 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
disappointed 1
in 1
his 1
conclusions 1
they 1
have 1
laid 1
the 1
supper 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
expect 1
company 1
they 1
have 1
laid 1
for 1
five 1
yes 1
i 1
fancy 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
company 1
dropping 1
in 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
surprised 1
that 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
has 1
not 1
already 1
arrived 1
ha 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
i 1
hear 1
his 1
step 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
visitor 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
who 1
came 1
bustling 1
in 1
dangling 1
his 1
glasses 1
more 1
vigorously 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
perturbed 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
aristocratic 1
features 1
my 1
messenger 1
reached 1
you 1
then 1
asked 1
holmes 1
yes 1
and 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
contents 1
startled 1
me 1
beyond 1
measure 1
have 1
you 1
good 1
authority 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
the 1
best 1
possible 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
what 1
will 1
the 1
duke 1
say 1
he 1
murmured 1
when 1
he 1
hears 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
has 1
been 1
subjected 1
to 1
such 1
humiliation 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
purest 1
accident 1
i 1
cannot 1
allow 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
humiliation 1
ah 1
you 1
look 1
on 1
these 1
things 1
from 1
another 1
standpoint 1
i 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
anyone 1
is 1
to 1
blame 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
lady 1
could 1
have 1
acted 1
otherwise 1
though 1
her 1
abrupt 1
method 1
of 1
doing 1
it 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
to 1
be 1
regretted 1
having 1
no 1
mother 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
advise 1
her 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
crisis 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
sir 1
a 1
public 1
slight 1
said 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
tapping 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
you 1
must 1
make 1
allowance 1
for 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
placed 1
in 1
so 1
unprecedented 1
a 1
position 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
no 1
allowance 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
angry 1
indeed 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
shamefully 1
used 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
said 1
holmes 1
yes 1
there 1
are 1
steps 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
if 1
i 1
cannot 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
lenient 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
i 1
have 1
brought 1
an 1
advocate 1
here 1
who 1
may 1
be 1
more 1
successful 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
ushered 1
in 1
a 1
lady 1
and 1
gentleman 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
said 1
he 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
introduce 1
you 1
to 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
francis 1
hay 1
moulton 1
the 1
lady 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
these 1
newcomers 1
our 1
client 1
had 1
sprung 1
from 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
stood 1
very 1
erect 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
and 1
his 1
hand 1
thrust 1
into 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
his 1
frockcoat 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
offended 1
dignity 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
quick 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
had 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
refused 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
eyes 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
his 1
resolution 1
perhaps 1
for 1
her 1
pleading 1
face 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
resist 1
youre 1
angry 1
robert 1
said 1
she 1
well 1
i 1
guess 1
you 1
have 1
every 1
cause 1
to 1
be 1
pray 1
make 1
no 1
apology 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
bitterly 1
oh 1
yes 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
treated 1
you 1
real 1
bad 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
i 1
went 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
rattled 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
frank 1
here 1
again 1
i 1
just 1
didnt 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
or 1
saying 1
i 1
only 1
wonder 1
i 1
didnt 1
fall 1
down 1
and 1
do 1
a 1
faint 1
right 1
there 1
before 1
the 1
altar 1
perhaps 1
mrs 1
moulton 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
while 1
you 1
explain 1
this 1
matter 1
if 1
i 1
may 1
give 1
an 1
opinion 1
remarked 1
the 1
strange 1
gentleman 1
weve 1
had 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
secrecy 1
over 1
this 1
business 1
already 1
for 1
my 1
part 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
all 1
europe 1
and 1
america 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wiry 1
sunburnt 1
man 1
cleanshaven 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
face 1
and 1
alert 1
manner 1
then 1
ill 1
tell 1
our 1
story 1
right 1
away 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
frank 1
here 1
and 1
i 1
met 1
in 1
84 1
in 1
mcquires 1
camp 1
near 1
the 1
rockies 1
where 1
pa 1
was 1
working 1
a 1
claim 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
frank 1
and 1
i 1
but 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
father 1
struck 1
a 1
rich 1
pocket 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
pile 1
while 1
poor 1
frank 1
here 1
had 1
a 1
claim 1
that 1
petered 1
out 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
nothing 1
the 1
richer 1
pa 1
grew 1
the 1
poorer 1
was 1
frank 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
pa 1
wouldnt 1
hear 1
of 1
our 1
engagement 1
lasting 1
any 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
frisco 1
frank 1
wouldnt 1
throw 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
though 1
so 1
he 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
without 1
pa 1
knowing 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
it 1
would 1
only 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
we 1
just 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
for 1
ourselves 1
frank 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
his 1
pile 1
too 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
claim 1
me 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
pa 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
promised 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
pledged 1
myself 1
not 1
to 1
marry 1
anyone 1
else 1
while 1
he 1
lived 1
why 1
shouldnt 1
we 1
be 1
married 1
right 1
away 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
feel 1
sure 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
wont 1
claim 1
to 1
be 1
your 1
husband 1
until 1
i 1
come 1
back 1
well 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
so 1
nicely 1
with 1
a 1
clergyman 1
all 1
ready 1
in 1
waiting 1
that 1
we 1
just 1
did 1
it 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
frank 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
seek 1
his 1
fortune 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
pa 1
the 1
next 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
frank 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
montana 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
prospecting 1
in 1
arizona 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
from 1
new 1
mexico 1
after 1
that 1
came 1
a 1
long 1
newspaper 1
story 1
about 1
how 1
a 1
miners 1
camp 1
had 1
been 1
attacked 1
by 1
apache 1
indians 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
my 1
franks 1
name 1
among 1
the 1
killed 1
i 1
fainted 1
dead 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
sick 1
for 1
months 1
after 1
pa 1
thought 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
decline 1
and 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
half 1
the 1
doctors 1
in 1
frisco 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
news 1
came 1
for 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
more 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
doubted 1
that 1
frank 1
was 1
really 1
dead 1
then 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
came 1
to 1
frisco 1
and 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
london 1
and 1
a 1
marriage 1
was 1
arranged 1
and 1
pa 1
was 1
very 1
pleased 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
on 1
this 1
earth 1
would 1
ever 1
take 1
the 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
my 1
poor 1
frank 1
still 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
married 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
of 1
course 1
id 1
have 1
done 1
my 1
duty 1
by 1
him 1
we 1
cant 1
command 1
our 1
love 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
our 1
actions 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
wife 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
what 1
i 1
felt 1
when 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
rails 1
i 1
glanced 1
back 1
and 1
saw 1
frank 1
standing 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
pew 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
ghost 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
again 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
question 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
whether 1
i 1
were 1
glad 1
or 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
i 1
wonder 1
i 1
didnt 1
drop 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
everything 1
was 1
turning 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
clergyman 1
were 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
buzz 1
of 1
a 1
bee 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
should 1
i 1
stop 1
the 1
service 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
i 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
for 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
finger 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
still 1
then 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
scribble 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
writing 1
me 1
a 1
note 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
his 1
pew 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
out 1
i 1
dropped 1
my 1
bouquet 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
slipped 1
the 1
note 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
me 1
the 1
flowers 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
line 1
asking 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
sign 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
never 1
doubted 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
duty 1
was 1
now 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
do 1
just 1
whatever 1
he 1
might 1
direct 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
back 1
i 1
told 1
my 1
maid 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
him 1
in 1
california 1
and 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
his 1
friend 1
i 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
but 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
few 1
things 1
packed 1
and 1
my 1
ulster 1
ready 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
hard 1
before 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
great 1
people 1
i 1
just 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
explain 1
afterwards 1
i 1
hadnt 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
ten 1
minutes 1
before 1
i 1
saw 1
frank 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
he 1
beckoned 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
walking 1
into 1
the 1
park 1
i 1
slipped 1
out 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
things 1
and 1
followed 1
him 1
some 1
woman 1
came 1
talking 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
about 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
to 1
meseemed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
i 1
heard 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
before 1
marriage 1
alsobut 1
i 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
soon 1
overtook 1
frank 1
we 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
cab 1
together 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
some 1
lodgings 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
in 1
gordon 1
square 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
true 1
wedding 1
after 1
all 1
those 1
years 1
of 1
waiting 1
frank 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
prisoner 1
among 1
the 1
apaches 1
had 1
escaped 1
came 1
on 1
to 1
frisco 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
dead 1
and 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
england 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
last 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
my 1
second 1
wedding 1
i 1
saw 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
paper 1
explained 1
the 1
american 1
it 1
gave 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
the 1
church 1
but 1
not 1
where 1
the 1
lady 1
lived 1
then 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
talk 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
and 1
frank 1
was 1
all 1
for 1
openness 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
ashamed 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
vanish 1
away 1
and 1
never 1
see 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
againjust 1
sending 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
pa 1
perhaps 1
to 1
show 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
alive 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
all 1
those 1
lords 1
and 1
ladies 1
sitting 1
round 1
that 1
breakfasttable 1
and 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
so 1
frank 1
took 1
my 1
weddingclothes 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
traced 1
and 1
dropped 1
them 1
away 1
somewhere 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
them 1
it 1
is 1
likely 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
on 1
to 1
paris 1
tomorrow 1
only 1
that 1
this 1
good 1
gentleman 1
mr 1
holmes 1
came 1
round 1
to 1
us 1
this 1
evening 1
though 1
how 1
he 1
found 1
us 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
think 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
us 1
very 1
clearly 1
and 1
kindly 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
wrong 1
and 1
that 1
frank 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
putting 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
so 1
secret 1
then 1
he 1
offered 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
talking 1
to 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
alone 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
round 1
to 1
his 1
rooms 1
at 1
once 1
now 1
robert 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
pain 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
very 1
meanly 1
of 1
me 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
had 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
relaxed 1
his 1
rigid 1
attitude 1
but 1
had 1
listened 1
with 1
a 1
frowning 1
brow 1
and 1
a 1
compressed 1
lip 1
to 1
this 1
long 1
narrative 1
excuse 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
custom 1
to 1
discuss 1
my 1
most 1
intimate 1
personal 1
affairs 1
in 1
this 1
public 1
manner 1
then 1
you 1
wont 1
forgive 1
me 1
you 1
wont 1
shake 1
hands 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
oh 1
certainly 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
pleasure 1
he 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
coldly 1
grasped 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
extended 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
hoped 1
suggested 1
holmes 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
joined 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
friendly 1
supper 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
you 1
ask 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
responded 1
his 1
lordship 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
acquiesce 1
in 1
these 1
recent 1
developments 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
make 1
merry 1
over 1
them 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
i 1
will 1
now 1
wish 1
you 1
all 1
a 1
very 1
goodnight 1
he 1
included 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
sweeping 1
bow 1
and 1
stalked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
then 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
at 1
least 1
will 1
honour 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
company 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
joy 1
to 1
meet 1
an 1
american 1
mr 1
moulton 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
a 1
monarch 1
and 1
the 1
blundering 1
of 1
a 1
minister 1
in 1
fargone 1
years 1
will 1
not 1
prevent 1
our 1
children 1
from 1
being 1
some 1
day 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
worldwide 1
country 1
under 1
a 1
flag 1
which 1
shall 1
be 1
a 1
quartering 1
of 1
the 1
union 1
jack 1
with 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
stripes 1
the 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
interesting 1
one 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
when 1
our 1
visitors 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
because 1
it 1
serves 1
to 1
show 1
very 1
clearly 1
how 1
simple 1
the 1
explanation 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
an 1
affair 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
almost 1
inexplicable 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
natural 1
than 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
as 1
narrated 1
by 1
this 1
lady 1
and 1
nothing 1
stranger 1
than 1
the 1
result 1
when 1
viewed 1
for 1
instance 1
by 1
mr 1
lestrade 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
yourself 1
at 1
fault 1
at 1
all 1
then 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
facts 1
were 1
very 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
undergo 1
the 1
wedding 1
ceremony 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
repented 1
of 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
of 1
returning 1
home 1
obviously 1
something 1
had 1
occurred 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
to 1
cause 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
mind 1
what 1
could 1
that 1
something 1
be 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
anyone 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
out 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
had 1
she 1
seen 1
someone 1
then 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
someone 1
from 1
america 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
spent 1
so 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
allowed 1
anyone 1
to 1
acquire 1
so 1
deep 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
mere 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
induce 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
plans 1
so 1
completely 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
arrived 1
by 1
a 1
process 1
of 1
exclusion 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
have 1
seen 1
an 1
american 1
then 1
who 1
could 1
this 1
american 1
be 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
possess 1
so 1
much 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
lover 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
husband 1
her 1
young 1
womanhood 1
had 1
i 1
knew 1
been 1
spent 1
in 1
rough 1
scenes 1
and 1
under 1
strange 1
conditions 1
so 1
far 1
i 1
had 1
got 1
before 1
i 1
ever 1
heard 1
lord 1
st 1
simons 1
narrative 1
when 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
pew 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
brides 1
manner 1
of 1
so 1
transparent 1
a 1
device 1
for 1
obtaining 1
a 1
note 1
as 1
the 1
dropping 1
of 1
a 1
bouquet 1
of 1
her 1
resort 1
to 1
her 1
confidential 1
maid 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
very 1
significant 1
allusion 1
to 1
claimjumpingwhich 1
in 1
miners 1
parlance 1
means 1
taking 1
possession 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
another 1
person 1
has 1
a 1
prior 1
claim 1
tothe 1
whole 1
situation 1
became 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
either 1
a 1
lover 1
or 1
was 1
a 1
previous 1
husbandthe 1
chances 1
being 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
and 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
you 1
find 1
them 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
but 1
friend 1
lestrade 1
held 1
information 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
himself 1
know 1
the 1
initials 1
were 1
of 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
importance 1
but 1
more 1
valuable 1
still 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
within 1
a 1
week 1
he 1
had 1
settled 1
his 1
bill 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
select 1
london 1
hotels 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
deduce 1
the 1
select 1
by 1
the 1
select 1
prices 1
eight 1
shillings 1
for 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
eightpence 1
for 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
sherry 1
pointed 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
expensive 1
hotels 1
there 1
are 1
not 1
many 1
in 1
london 1
which 1
charge 1
at 1
that 1
rate 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
visited 1
in 1
northumberland 1
avenue 1
i 1
learned 1
by 1
an 1
inspection 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
that 1
francis 1
h 1
moulton 1
an 1
american 1
gentleman 1
had 1
left 1
only 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
and 1
on 1
looking 1
over 1
the 1
entries 1
against 1
him 1
i 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
very 1
items 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
duplicate 1
bill 1
his 1
letters 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
forwarded 1
to 1
226 1
gordon 1
square 1
so 1
thither 1
i 1
travelled 1
and 1
being 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
loving 1
couple 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
ventured 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
some 1
paternal 1
advice 1
and 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
make 1
their 1
position 1
a 1
little 1
clearer 1
both 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
to 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
in 1
particular 1
i 1
invited 1
them 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
here 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
i 1
made 1
him 1
keep 1
the 1
appointment 1
but 1
with 1
no 1
very 1
good 1
result 1
i 1
remarked 1
his 1
conduct 1
was 1
certainly 1
not 1
very 1
gracious 1
ah 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
smiling 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
gracious 1
either 1
if 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
of 1
wooing 1
and 1
wedding 1
you 1
found 1
yourself 1
deprived 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
of 1
wife 1
and 1
of 1
fortune 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
judge 1
lord 1
st 1
simon 1
very 1
mercifully 1
and 1
thank 1
our 1
stars 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
never 1
likely 1
to 1
find 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
draw 1
your 1
chair 1
up 1
and 1
hand 1
me 1
my 1
violin 1
for 1
the 1
only 1
problem 1
we 1
have 1
still 1
to 1
solve 1
is 1
how 1
to 1
while 1
away 1
these 1
bleak 1
autumnal 1
evenings 1
xi 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
beryl 1
coronet 1
holmes 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
i 1
stood 1
one 1
morning 1
in 1
our 1
bowwindow 1
looking 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
madman 1
coming 1
along 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
sad 1
that 1
his 1
relatives 1
should 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
alone 1
my 1
friend 1
rose 1
lazily 1
from 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
stood 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
his 1
dressinggown 1
looking 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bright 1
crisp 1
february 1
morning 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
still 1
lay 1
deep 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
shimmering 1
brightly 1
in 1
the 1
wintry 1
sun 1
down 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
baker 1
street 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
ploughed 1
into 1
a 1
brown 1
crumbly 1
band 1
by 1
the 1
traffic 1
but 1
at 1
either 1
side 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
heapedup 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
footpaths 1
it 1
still 1
lay 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
the 1
grey 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleaned 1
and 1
scraped 1
but 1
was 1
still 1
dangerously 1
slippery 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
fewer 1
passengers 1
than 1
usual 1
indeed 1
from 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
metropolitan 1
station 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
coming 1
save 1
the 1
single 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
eccentric 1
conduct 1
had 1
drawn 1
my 1
attention 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
about 1
fifty 1
tall 1
portly 1
and 1
imposing 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
strongly 1
marked 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
commanding 1
figure 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
sombre 1
yet 1
rich 1
style 1
in 1
black 1
frockcoat 1
shining 1
hat 1
neat 1
brown 1
gaiters 1
and 1
wellcut 1
pearlgrey 1
trousers 1
yet 1
his 1
actions 1
were 1
in 1
absurd 1
contrast 1
to 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
his 1
dress 1
and 1
features 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
hard 1
with 1
occasional 1
little 1
springs 1
such 1
as 1
a 1
weary 1
man 1
gives 1
who 1
is 1
little 1
accustomed 1
to 1
set 1
any 1
tax 1
upon 1
his 1
legs 1
as 1
he 1
ran 1
he 1
jerked 1
his 1
hands 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
waggled 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
writhed 1
his 1
face 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
contortions 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
can 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
asked 1
he 1
is 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
numbers 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
here 1
said 1
holmes 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
here 1
yes 1
i 1
rather 1
think 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
professionally 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
recognise 1
the 1
symptoms 1
ha 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
man 1
puffing 1
and 1
blowing 1
rushed 1
at 1
our 1
door 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
our 1
bell 1
until 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
resounded 1
with 1
the 1
clanging 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
our 1
room 1
still 1
puffing 1
still 1
gesticulating 1
but 1
with 1
so 1
fixed 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
despair 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
our 1
smiles 1
were 1
turned 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
horror 1
and 1
pity 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
his 1
words 1
out 1
but 1
swayed 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
plucked 1
at 1
his 1
hair 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
driven 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
limits 1
of 1
his 1
reason 1
then 1
suddenly 1
springing 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
beat 1
his 1
head 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
we 1
both 1
rushed 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
tore 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
pushed 1
him 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
easychair 1
and 1
sitting 1
beside 1
him 1
patted 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
chatted 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
soothing 1
tones 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
how 1
to 1
employ 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
story 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
are 1
fatigued 1
with 1
your 1
haste 1
pray 1
wait 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
recovered 1
yourself 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
most 1
happy 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
any 1
little 1
problem 1
which 1
you 1
may 1
submit 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
man 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
more 1
with 1
a 1
heaving 1
chest 1
fighting 1
against 1
his 1
emotion 1
then 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
over 1
his 1
brow 1
set 1
his 1
lips 1
tight 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
towards 1
us 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
think 1
me 1
mad 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
great 1
trouble 1
responded 1
holmes 1
god 1
knows 1
i 1
havea 1
trouble 1
which 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
unseat 1
my 1
reason 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
so 1
terrible 1
is 1
it 1
public 1
disgrace 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
faced 1
although 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
character 1
has 1
never 1
yet 1
borne 1
a 1
stain 1
private 1
affliction 1
also 1
is 1
the 1
lot 1
of 1
every 1
man 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
coming 1
together 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
frightful 1
a 1
form 1
have 1
been 1
enough 1
to 1
shake 1
my 1
very 1
soul 1
besides 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
i 1
alone 1
the 1
very 1
noblest 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
may 1
suffer 1
unless 1
some 1
way 1
be 1
found 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
pray 1
compose 1
yourself 1
sir 1
said 1
holmes 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
account 1
of 1
who 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
has 1
befallen 1
you 1
my 1
name 1
answered 1
our 1
visitor 1
is 1
probably 1
familiar 1
to 1
your 1
ears 1
i 1
am 1
alexander 1
holder 1
of 1
the 1
banking 1
firm 1
of 1
holder 1
stevenson 1
of 1
threadneedle 1
street 1
the 1
name 1
was 1
indeed 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
senior 1
partner 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
largest 1
private 1
banking 1
concern 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
of 1
london 1
what 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
then 1
to 1
bring 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
foremost 1
citizens 1
of 1
london 1
to 1
this 1
most 1
pitiable 1
pass 1
we 1
waited 1
all 1
curiosity 1
until 1
with 1
another 1
effort 1
he 1
braced 1
himself 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
story 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
time 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
i 1
hastened 1
here 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
inspector 1
suggested 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
secure 1
your 1
cooperation 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
by 1
the 1
underground 1
and 1
hurried 1
from 1
there 1
on 1
foot 1
for 1
the 1
cabs 1
go 1
slowly 1
through 1
this 1
snow 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
out 1
of 1
breath 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
takes 1
very 1
little 1
exercise 1
i 1
feel 1
better 1
now 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
put 1
the 1
facts 1
before 1
you 1
as 1
shortly 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
successful 1
banking 1
business 1
as 1
much 1
depends 1
upon 1
our 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
remunerative 1
investments 1
for 1
our 1
funds 1
as 1
upon 1
our 1
increasing 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
our 1
depositors 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
lucrative 1
means 1
of 1
laying 1
out 1
money 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
loans 1
where 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
unimpeachable 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
noble 1
families 1
to 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
advanced 1
large 1
sums 1
upon 1
the 1
security 1
of 1
their 1
pictures 1
libraries 1
or 1
plate 1
yesterday 1
morning 1
i 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
my 1
office 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
when 1
a 1
card 1
was 1
brought 1
in 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
clerks 1
i 1
started 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
name 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
none 1
other 1
thanwell 1
perhaps 1
even 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
name 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
household 1
word 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
earthone 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
noblest 1
most 1
exalted 1
names 1
in 1
england 1
i 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
the 1
honour 1
and 1
attempted 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
he 1
plunged 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
business 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
wishes 1
to 1
hurry 1
quickly 1
through 1
a 1
disagreeable 1
task 1

said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
informed 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
advancing 1
money 1
the 1
firm 1
does 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
good 1
i 1
answered 1
it 1
is 1
absolutely 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
50000 1
pounds 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
could 1
of 1
course 1
borrow 1
so 1
trifling 1
a 1
sum 1
ten 1
times 1
over 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
but 1
i 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
that 1
business 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
position 1
you 1
can 1
readily 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
unwise 1
to 1
place 1
ones 1
self 1
under 1
obligations 1
for 1
how 1
long 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
this 1
sum 1
i 1
asked 1
next 1
monday 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
large 1
sum 1
due 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
then 1
most 1
certainly 1
repay 1
what 1
you 1
advance 1
with 1
whatever 1
interest 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
charge 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
money 1
should 1
be 1
paid 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
advance 1
it 1
without 1
further 1
parley 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
private 1
purse 1
said 1
i 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
that 1
the 1
strain 1
would 1
be 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
could 1
bear 1
if 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
then 1
in 1
justice 1
to 1
my 1
partner 1
i 1
must 1
insist 1
that 1
even 1
in 1
your 1
case 1
every 1
businesslike 1
precaution 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
i 1
should 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
raising 1
up 1
a 1
square 1
black 1
morocco 1
case 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
beside 1
his 1
chair 1
you 1
have 1
doubtless 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
beryl 1
coronet 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
public 1
possessions 1
of 1
the 1
empire 1
said 1
i 1
precisely 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
there 1
imbedded 1
in 1
soft 1
fleshcoloured 1
velvet 1
lay 1
the 1
magnificent 1
piece 1
of 1
jewellery 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
named 1
there 1
are 1
thirtynine 1
enormous 1
beryls 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
chasing 1
is 1
incalculable 1
the 1
lowest 1
estimate 1
would 1
put 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
double 1
the 1
sum 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
asked 1
i 1
am 1
prepared 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
my 1
security 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
some 1
perplexity 1
from 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
illustrious 1
client 1
you 1
doubt 1
its 1
value 1
he 1
asked 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
only 1
doubt 1
the 1
propriety 1
of 1
my 1
leaving 1
it 1
you 1
may 1
set 1
your 1
mind 1
at 1
rest 1
about 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
absolutely 1
certain 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
in 1
four 1
days 1
to 1
reclaim 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pure 1
matter 1
of 1
form 1
is 1
the 1
security 1
sufficient 1
ample 1
you 1
understand 1
mr 1
holder 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
giving 1
you 1
a 1
strong 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
confidence 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
in 1
you 1
founded 1
upon 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
rely 1
upon 1
you 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
discreet 1
and 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
all 1
gossip 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
above 1
all 1
to 1
preserve 1
this 1
coronet 1
with 1
every 1
possible 1
precaution 1
because 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
would 1
be 1
caused 1
if 1
any 1
harm 1
were 1
to 1
befall 1
it 1
any 1
injury 1
to 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
almost 1
as 1
serious 1
as 1
its 1
complete 1
loss 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
beryls 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
match 1
these 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
to 1
replace 1
them 1
i 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
with 1
every 1
confidence 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
call 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
person 1
on 1
monday 1
morning 1
seeing 1
that 1
my 1
client 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
leave 1
i 1
said 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
calling 1
for 1
my 1
cashier 1
i 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
pay 1
over 1
fifty 1
1000 1
pound 1
notes 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
once 1
more 1
however 1
with 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
think 1
with 1
some 1
misgivings 1
of 1
the 1
immense 1
responsibility 1
which 1
it 1
entailed 1
upon 1
me 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
national 1
possession 1
a 1
horrible 1
scandal 1
would 1
ensue 1
if 1
any 1
misfortune 1
should 1
occur 1
to 1
it 1
i 1
already 1
regretted 1
having 1
ever 1
consented 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
it 1
however 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
so 1
i 1
locked 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
private 1
safe 1
and 1
turned 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
work 1
when 1
evening 1
came 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
imprudence 1
to 1
leave 1
so 1
precious 1
a 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
behind 1
me 1
bankers 1
safes 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
before 1
now 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
not 1
mine 1
be 1
if 1
so 1
how 1
terrible 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
myself 1
i 1
determined 1
therefore 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
i 1
would 1
always 1
carry 1
the 1
case 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
with 1
me 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
never 1
be 1
really 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
reach 1
with 1
this 1
intention 1
i 1
called 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
drove 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
at 1
streatham 1
carrying 1
the 1
jewel 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
breathe 1
freely 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
upstairs 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
bureau 1
of 1
my 1
dressingroom 1
and 1
now 1
a 1
word 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
household 1
mr 1
holmes 1
for 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
thoroughly 1
understand 1
the 1
situation 1
my 1
groom 1
and 1
my 1
page 1
sleep 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
set 1
aside 1
altogether 1
i 1
have 1
three 1
maidservants 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
years 1
and 1
whose 1
absolute 1
reliability 1
is 1
quite 1
above 1
suspicion 1
another 1
lucy 1
parr 1
the 1
second 1
waitingmaid 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
in 1
my 1
service 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
she 1
came 1
with 1
an 1
excellent 1
character 1
however 1
and 1
has 1
always 1
given 1
me 1
satisfaction 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
girl 1
and 1
has 1
attracted 1
admirers 1
who 1
have 1
occasionally 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
drawback 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
we 1
believe 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
good 1
girl 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
servants 1
my 1
family 1
itself 1
is 1
so 1
small 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
describe 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
have 1
an 1
only 1
son 1
arthur 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
disappointment 1
to 1
me 1
mr 1
holmesa 1
grievous 1
disappointment 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
myself 1
to 1
blame 1
people 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
spoiled 1
him 1
very 1
likely 1
i 1
have 1
when 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
died 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
love 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
smile 1
fade 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
denied 1
him 1
a 1
wish 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
sterner 1
but 1
i 1
meant 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
it 1
was 1
naturally 1
my 1
intention 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
succeed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
business 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
of 1
a 1
business 1
turn 1
he 1
was 1
wild 1
wayward 1
and 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
trust 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
handling 1
of 1
large 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
club 1
and 1
there 1
having 1
charming 1
manners 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
the 1
intimate 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
men 1
with 1
long 1
purses 1
and 1
expensive 1
habits 1
he 1
learned 1
to 1
play 1
heavily 1
at 1
cards 1
and 1
to 1
squander 1
money 1
on 1
the 1
turf 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
implore 1
me 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
an 1
advance 1
upon 1
his 1
allowance 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
settle 1
his 1
debts 1
of 1
honour 1
he 1
tried 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
to 1
break 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dangerous 1
company 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
keeping 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
indeed 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
should 1
gain 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
frequently 1
brought 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
resist 1
the 1
fascination 1
of 1
his 1
manner 1
he 1
is 1
older 1
than 1
arthur 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
his 1
fingertips 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
everywhere 1
seen 1
everything 1
a 1
brilliant 1
talker 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
personal 1
beauty 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
far 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
glamour 1
of 1
his 1
presence 1
i 1
am 1
convinced 1
from 1
his 1
cynical 1
speech 1
and 1
the 1
look 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
caught 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
deeply 1
distrusted 1
so 1
i 1
think 1
and 1
so 1
too 1
thinks 1
my 1
little 1
mary 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
womans 1
quick 1
insight 1
into 1
character 1
and 1
now 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
she 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
niece 1
but 1
when 1
my 1
brother 1
died 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
adopted 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
her 1
ever 1
since 1
as 1
my 1
daughter 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
sunbeam 1
in 1
my 1
housesweet 1
loving 1
beautiful 1
a 1
wonderful 1
manager 1
and 1
housekeeper 1
yet 1
as 1
tender 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
gentle 1
as 1
a 1
woman 1
could 1
be 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
without 1
her 1
in 1
only 1
one 1
matter 1
has 1
she 1
ever 1
gone 1
against 1
my 1
wishes 1
twice 1
my 1
boy 1
has 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
loves 1
her 1
devotedly 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
she 1
has 1
refused 1
him 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
anyone 1
could 1
have 1
drawn 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
right 1
path 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
she 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
marriage 1
might 1
have 1
changed 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
but 1
now 1
alas 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
lateforever 1
too 1
late 1
now 1
mr 1
holmes 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
under 1
my 1
roof 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
continue 1
with 1
my 1
miserable 1
story 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
taking 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
drawingroom 1
that 1
night 1
after 1
dinner 1
i 1
told 1
arthur 1
and 1
mary 1
my 1
experience 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
precious 1
treasure 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
under 1
our 1
roof 1
suppressing 1
only 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
lucy 1
parr 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
coffee 1
had 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
swear 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
mary 1
and 1
arthur 1
were 1
much 1
interested 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
famous 1
coronet 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
it 1
where 1
have 1
you 1
put 1
it 1
asked 1
arthur 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
bureau 1
well 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
goodness 1
the 1
house 1
wont 1
be 1
burgled 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
locked 1
up 1
i 1
answered 1
oh 1
any 1
old 1
key 1
will 1
fit 1
that 1
bureau 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
youngster 1
i 1
have 1
opened 1
it 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
boxroom 1
cupboard 1
he 1
often 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
way 1
of 1
talking 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
thought 1
little 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
followed 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
however 1
that 1
night 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
grave 1
face 1
look 1
here 1
dad 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
can 1
you 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
200 1
pounds 1
no 1
i 1
cannot 1
i 1
answered 1
sharply 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
far 1
too 1
generous 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
money 1
matters 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
kind 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
this 1
money 1
or 1
else 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
show 1
my 1
face 1
inside 1
the 1
club 1
again 1
and 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
thing 1
too 1
i 1
cried 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
leave 1
it 1
a 1
dishonoured 1
man 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
disgrace 1
i 1
must 1
raise 1
the 1
money 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
must 1
try 1
other 1
means 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
demand 1
during 1
the 1
month 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
farthing 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
cried 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
bowed 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
without 1
another 1
word 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
i 1
unlocked 1
my 1
bureau 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
my 1
treasure 1
was 1
safe 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
again 1
then 1
i 1
started 1
to 1
go 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
securea 1
duty 1
which 1
i 1
usually 1
leave 1
to 1
mary 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
well 1
to 1
perform 1
myself 1
that 1
night 1
as 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
i 1
saw 1
mary 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
and 1
fastened 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
tell 1
me 1
dad 1
said 1
she 1
looking 1
i 1
thought 1
a 1
little 1
disturbed 1
did 1
you 1
give 1
lucy 1
the 1
maid 1
leave 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
tonight 1
certainly 1
not 1
she 1
came 1
in 1
just 1
now 1
by 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
gate 1
to 1
see 1
someone 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
hardly 1
safe 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
stopped 1
you 1
must 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
or 1
i 1
will 1
if 1
you 1
prefer 1
it 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
that 1
everything 1
is 1
fastened 1
quite 1
sure 1
dad 1
then 1
goodnight 1
i 1
kissed 1
her 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
bedroom 1
again 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
i 1
am 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
everything 1
mr 1
holmes 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
any 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
but 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
question 1
me 1
upon 1
any 1
point 1
which 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
make 1
clear 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
your 1
statement 1
is 1
singularly 1
lucid 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
now 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
particularly 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
sleeper 1
and 1
the 1
anxiety 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
tended 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
even 1
less 1
so 1
than 1
usual 1
about 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
some 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
ere 1
i 1
was 1
wide 1
awake 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
an 1
impression 1
behind 1
it 1
as 1
though 1
a 1
window 1
had 1
gently 1
closed 1
somewhere 1
i 1
lay 1
listening 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ears 1
suddenly 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
distinct 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
moving 1
softly 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
i 1
slipped 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
all 1
palpitating 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
peeped 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
my 1
dressingroom 1
door 1
arthur 1
i 1
screamed 1
you 1
villain 1
you 1
thief 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
touch 1
that 1
coronet 1
the 1
gas 1
was 1
half 1
up 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
and 1
my 1
unhappy 1
boy 1
dressed 1
only 1
in 1
his 1
shirt 1
and 1
trousers 1
was 1
standing 1
beside 1
the 1
light 1
holding 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
wrenching 1
at 1
it 1
or 1
bending 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
at 1
my 1
cry 1
he 1
dropped 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
turned 1
as 1
pale 1
as 1
death 1
i 1
snatched 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
corners 1
with 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
beryls 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
missing 1
you 1
blackguard 1
i 1
shouted 1
beside 1
myself 1
with 1
rage 1
you 1
have 1
destroyed 1
it 1
you 1
have 1
dishonoured 1
me 1
forever 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
jewels 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
stolen 1
he 1
cried 1
yes 1
thief 1
i 1
roared 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
shoulder 1
there 1
are 1
none 1
missing 1
there 1
cannot 1
be 1
any 1
missing 1
said 1
he 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
missing 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
they 1
are 1
must 1
i 1
call 1
you 1
a 1
liar 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
thief 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
see 1
you 1
trying 1
to 1
tear 1
off 1
another 1
piece 1
you 1
have 1
called 1
me 1
names 1
enough 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
it 1
any 1
longer 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
say 1
another 1
word 1
about 1
this 1
business 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
chosen 1
to 1
insult 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
leave 1
your 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
make 1
my 1
own 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
you 1
shall 1
leave 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
i 1
cried 1
halfmad 1
with 1
grief 1
and 1
rage 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
this 1
matter 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
you 1
shall 1
learn 1
nothing 1
from 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
passion 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
thought 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
nature 1
if 1
you 1
choose 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
police 1
let 1
the 1
police 1
find 1
what 1
they 1
can 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
was 1
astir 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
raised 1
my 1
voice 1
in 1
my 1
anger 1
mary 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
of 1
arthurs 1
face 1
she 1
read 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
scream 1
fell 1
down 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
sent 1
the 1
housemaid 1
for 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
investigation 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
at 1
once 1
when 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
a 1
constable 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
arthur 1
who 1
had 1
stood 1
sullenly 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
folded 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
intention 1
to 1
charge 1
him 1
with 1
theft 1
i 1
answered 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
private 1
matter 1
but 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
public 1
one 1
since 1
the 1
ruined 1
coronet 1
was 1
national 1
property 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
should 1
have 1
its 1
way 1
in 1
everything 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
arrested 1
at 1
once 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
your 1
advantage 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
mine 1
if 1
i 1
might 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
get 1
away 1
or 1
perhaps 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
conceal 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
then 1
realising 1
the 1
dreadful 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
placed 1
i 1
implored 1
him 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
my 1
honour 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
far 1
greater 1
than 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
stake 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
threatened 1
to 1
raise 1
a 1
scandal 1
which 1
would 1
convulse 1
the 1
nation 1
he 1
might 1
avert 1
it 1
all 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
missing 1
stones 1
you 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
face 1
the 1
matter 1
said 1
i 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
no 1
confession 1
could 1
make 1
your 1
guilt 1
more 1
heinous 1
if 1
you 1
but 1
make 1
such 1
reparation 1
as 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
by 1
telling 1
us 1
where 1
the 1
beryls 1
are 1
all 1
shall 1
be 1
forgiven 1
and 1
forgotten 1
keep 1
your 1
forgiveness 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
he 1
answered 1
turning 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sneer 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
hardened 1
for 1
any 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
influence 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
way 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
called 1
in 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
into 1
custody 1
a 1
search 1
was 1
made 1
at 1
once 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
his 1
person 1
but 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
of 1
every 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
have 1
concealed 1
the 1
gems 1
but 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
nor 1
would 1
the 1
wretched 1
boy 1
open 1
his 1
mouth 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
persuasions 1
and 1
our 1
threats 1
this 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
removed 1
to 1
a 1
cell 1
and 1
i 1
after 1
going 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
police 1
formalities 1
have 1
hurried 1
round 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
implore 1
you 1
to 1
use 1
your 1
skill 1
in 1
unravelling 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
openly 1
confessed 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
at 1
present 1
make 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
to 1
any 1
expense 1
which 1
you 1
think 1
necessary 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
offered 1
a 1
reward 1
of 1
1000 1
pounds 1
my 1
god 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
honour 1
my 1
gems 1
and 1
my 1
son 1
in 1
one 1
night 1
oh 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
he 1
put 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
rocked 1
himself 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
droning 1
to 1
himself 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
whose 1
grief 1
has 1
got 1
beyond 1
words 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
silent 1
for 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
brows 1
knitted 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
do 1
you 1
receive 1
much 1
company 1
he 1
asked 1
none 1
save 1
my 1
partner 1
with 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
an 1
occasional 1
friend 1
of 1
arthurs 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
has 1
been 1
several 1
times 1
lately 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
i 1
think 1
do 1
you 1
go 1
out 1
much 1
in 1
society 1
arthur 1
does 1
mary 1
and 1
i 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
we 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
is 1
unusual 1
in 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
she 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
quiet 1
nature 1
besides 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
very 1
young 1
she 1
is 1
fourandtwenty 1
this 1
matter 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
shock 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
terrible 1
she 1
is 1
even 1
more 1
affected 1
than 1
i 1
you 1
have 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
any 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
sons 1
guilt 1
how 1
can 1
we 1
have 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
i 1
hardly 1
consider 1
that 1
a 1
conclusive 1
proof 1
was 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
all 1
injured 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
twisted 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
god 1
bless 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
doing 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
heavy 1
a 1
task 1
what 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
there 1
at 1
all 1
if 1
his 1
purpose 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
precisely 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
guilty 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
invent 1
a 1
lie 1
his 1
silence 1
appears 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
cut 1
both 1
ways 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
what 1
did 1
the 1
police 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
noise 1
which 1
awoke 1
you 1
from 1
your 1
sleep 1
they 1
considered 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
caused 1
by 1
arthurs 1
closing 1
his 1
bedroom 1
door 1
a 1
likely 1
story 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
bent 1
on 1
felony 1
would 1
slam 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
wake 1
a 1
household 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
say 1
then 1
of 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
these 1
gems 1
they 1
are 1
still 1
sounding 1
the 1
planking 1
and 1
probing 1
the 1
furniture 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
them 1
have 1
they 1
thought 1
of 1
looking 1
outside 1
the 1
house 1
yes 1
they 1
have 1
shown 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
the 1
whole 1
garden 1
has 1
already 1
been 1
minutely 1
examined 1
now 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
said 1
holmes 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
obvious 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
that 1
this 1
matter 1
really 1
strikes 1
very 1
much 1
deeper 1
than 1
either 1
you 1
or 1
the 1
police 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
simple 1
case 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
exceedingly 1
complex 1
consider 1
what 1
is 1
involved 1
by 1
your 1
theory 1
you 1
suppose 1
that 1
your 1
son 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
went 1
at 1
great 1
risk 1
to 1
your 1
dressingroom 1
opened 1
your 1
bureau 1
took 1
out 1
your 1
coronet 1
broke 1
off 1
by 1
main 1
force 1
a 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
it 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
place 1
concealed 1
three 1
gems 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
thirtynine 1
with 1
such 1
skill 1
that 1
nobody 1
can 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
thirtysix 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
exposed 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
discovered 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
now 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
theory 1
tenable 1
but 1
what 1
other 1
is 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
despair 1
if 1
his 1
motives 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
explain 1
them 1
it 1
is 1
our 1
task 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
out 1
replied 1
holmes 1
so 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
mr 1
holder 1
we 1
will 1
set 1
off 1
for 1
streatham 1
together 1
and 1
devote 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
glancing 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
closely 1
into 1
details 1
my 1
friend 1
insisted 1
upon 1
my 1
accompanying 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
expedition 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
eager 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
sympathy 1
were 1
deeply 1
stirred 1
by 1
the 1
story 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
listened 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
guilt 1
of 1
the 1
bankers 1
son 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
obvious 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
to 1
his 1
unhappy 1
father 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
had 1
such 1
faith 1
in 1
holmes 1
judgment 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
grounds 1
for 1
hope 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
the 1
accepted 1
explanation 1
he 1
hardly 1
spoke 1
a 1
word 1
the 1
whole 1
way 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
southern 1
suburb 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
chin 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
his 1
hat 1
drawn 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
sunk 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
thought 1
our 1
client 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
fresh 1
heart 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
hope 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
presented 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
even 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
desultory 1
chat 1
with 1
me 1
over 1
his 1
business 1
affairs 1
a 1
short 1
railway 1
journey 1
and 1
a 1
shorter 1
walk 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
fairbank 1
the 1
modest 1
residence 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
financier 1
fairbank 1
was 1
a 1
goodsized 1
square 1
house 1
of 1
white 1
stone 1
standing 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
a 1
double 1
carriagesweep 1
with 1
a 1
snowclad 1
lawn 1
stretched 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
to 1
two 1
large 1
iron 1
gates 1
which 1
closed 1
the 1
entrance 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
thicket 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
narrow 1
path 1
between 1
two 1
neat 1
hedges 1
stretching 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
and 1
forming 1
the 1
tradesmens 1
entrance 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
ran 1
a 1
lane 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
itself 1
within 1
the 1
grounds 1
at 1
all 1
being 1
a 1
public 1
though 1
little 1
used 1
thoroughfare 1
holmes 1
left 1
us 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
walked 1
slowly 1
all 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
across 1
the 1
front 1
down 1
the 1
tradesmens 1
path 1
and 1
so 1
round 1
by 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
so 1
long 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
mr 1
holder 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
diningroom 1
and 1
waited 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
return 1
we 1
were 1
sitting 1
there 1
in 1
silence 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
rather 1
above 1
the 1
middle 1
height 1
slim 1
with 1
dark 1
hair 1
and 1
eyes 1
which 1
seemed 1
the 1
darker 1
against 1
the 1
absolute 1
pallor 1
of 1
her 1
skin 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
such 1
deadly 1
paleness 1
in 1
a 1
womans 1
face 1
her 1
lips 1
too 1
were 1
bloodless 1
but 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
flushed 1
with 1
crying 1
as 1
she 1
swept 1
silently 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
greater 1
sense 1
of 1
grief 1
than 1
the 1
banker 1
had 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
more 1
striking 1
in 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
strong 1
character 1
with 1
immense 1
capacity 1
for 1
selfrestraint 1
disregarding 1
my 1
presence 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
passed 1
her 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
sweet 1
womanly 1
caress 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
orders 1
that 1
arthur 1
should 1
be 1
liberated 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
dad 1
she 1
asked 1
no 1
no 1
my 1
girl 1
the 1
matter 1
must 1
be 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
womans 1
instincts 1
are 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
no 1
harm 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
having 1
acted 1
so 1
harshly 1
why 1
is 1
he 1
silent 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
who 1
knows 1
perhaps 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
angry 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
suspect 1
him 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
help 1
suspecting 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
actually 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
oh 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
oh 1
do 1
do 1
take 1
my 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
let 1
the 1
matter 1
drop 1
and 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
dreadful 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
arthur 1
in 1
prison 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
let 1
it 1
drop 1
until 1
the 1
gems 1
are 1
foundnever 1
mary 1
your 1
affection 1
for 1
arthur 1
blinds 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
awful 1
consequences 1
to 1
me 1
far 1
from 1
hushing 1
the 1
thing 1
up 1
i 1
have 1
brought 1
a 1
gentleman 1
down 1
from 1
london 1
to 1
inquire 1
more 1
deeply 1
into 1
it 1
this 1
gentleman 1
she 1
asked 1
facing 1
round 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
his 1
friend 1
he 1
wished 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
he 1
is 1
round 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
now 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
she 1
raised 1
her 1
dark 1
eyebrows 1
what 1
can 1
he 1
hope 1
to 1
find 1
there 1
ah 1
this 1
i 1
suppose 1
is 1
he 1
i 1
trust 1
sir 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
succeed 1
in 1
proving 1
what 1
i 1
feel 1
sure 1
is 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
my 1
cousin 1
arthur 1
is 1
innocent 1
of 1
this 1
crime 1
i 1
fully 1
share 1
your 1
opinion 1
and 1
i 1
trust 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
prove 1
it 1
returned 1
holmes 1
going 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mat 1
to 1
knock 1
the 1
snow 1
from 1
his 1
shoes 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
addressing 1
miss 1
mary 1
holder 1
might 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
two 1
pray 1
do 1
sir 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
help 1
to 1
clear 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
up 1
you 1
heard 1
nothing 1
yourself 1
last 1
night 1
nothing 1
until 1
my 1
uncle 1
here 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
loudly 1
i 1
heard 1
that 1
and 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
you 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
and 1
doors 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
did 1
you 1
fasten 1
all 1
the 1
windows 1
yes 1
were 1
they 1
all 1
fastened 1
this 1
morning 1
yes 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
maid 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
sweetheart 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
remarked 1
to 1
your 1
uncle 1
last 1
night 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
yes 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
waited 1
in 1
the 1
drawingroom 1
and 1
who 1
may 1
have 1
heard 1
uncles 1
remarks 1
about 1
the 1
coronet 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
infer 1
that 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
gone 1
out 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
may 1
have 1
planned 1
the 1
robbery 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
vague 1
theories 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
impatiently 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
saw 1
arthur 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
wait 1
a 1
little 1
mr 1
holder 1
we 1
must 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
that 1
about 1
this 1
girl 1
miss 1
holder 1
you 1
saw 1
her 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
i 1
presume 1
yes 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
fastened 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
met 1
her 1
slipping 1
in 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
man 1
too 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
him 1
oh 1
yes 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
greengrocer 1
who 1
brings 1
our 1
vegetables 1
round 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
francis 1
prosper 1
he 1
stood 1
said 1
holmes 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
the 1
doorthat 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
farther 1
up 1
the 1
path 1
than 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
door 1
yes 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
something 1
like 1
fear 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
ladys 1
expressive 1
black 1
eyes 1
why 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
a 1
magician 1
said 1
she 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
she 1
smiled 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answering 1
smile 1
in 1
holmes 1
thin 1
eager 1
face 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
now 1
to 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
shall 1
probably 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
perhaps 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
lower 1
windows 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
up 1
he 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
round 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
pausing 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
large 1
one 1
which 1
looked 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
onto 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
this 1
he 1
opened 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
sill 1
with 1
his 1
powerful 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
now 1
we 1
shall 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
bankers 1
dressingroom 1
was 1
a 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
little 1
chamber 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
carpet 1
a 1
large 1
bureau 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
mirror 1
holmes 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bureau 1
first 1
and 1
looked 1
hard 1
at 1
the 1
lock 1
which 1
key 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
that 1
which 1
my 1
son 1
himself 1
indicatedthat 1
of 1
the 1
cupboard 1
of 1
the 1
lumberroom 1
have 1
you 1
it 1
here 1
that 1
is 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
dressingtable 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
bureau 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
noiseless 1
lock 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
wake 1
you 1
this 1
case 1
i 1
presume 1
contains 1
the 1
coronet 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
taking 1
out 1
the 1
diadem 1
he 1
laid 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
magnificent 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
jewellers 1
art 1
and 1
the 1
thirtysix 1
stones 1
were 1
the 1
finest 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
was 1
a 1
cracked 1
edge 1
where 1
a 1
corner 1
holding 1
three 1
gems 1
had 1
been 1
torn 1
away 1
now 1
mr 1
holder 1
said 1
holmes 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
corner 1
which 1
corresponds 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
unfortunately 1
lost 1
might 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
the 1
banker 1
recoiled 1
in 1
horror 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
trying 1
said 1
he 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
holmes 1
suddenly 1
bent 1
his 1
strength 1
upon 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
result 1
i 1
feel 1
it 1
give 1
a 1
little 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
though 1
i 1
am 1
exceptionally 1
strong 1
in 1
the 1
fingers 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
all 1
my 1
time 1
to 1
break 1
it 1
an 1
ordinary 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
now 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
would 1
happen 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
break 1
it 1
mr 1
holder 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
noise 1
like 1
a 1
pistol 1
shot 1
do 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
happened 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
of 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
heard 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
dark 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
may 1
grow 1
lighter 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
miss 1
holder 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
still 1
share 1
my 1
uncles 1
perplexity 1
your 1
son 1
had 1
no 1
shoes 1
or 1
slippers 1
on 1
when 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
nothing 1
on 1
save 1
only 1
his 1
trousers 1
and 1
shirt 1
thank 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
certainly 1
been 1
favoured 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
luck 1
during 1
this 1
inquiry 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
entirely 1
our 1
own 1
fault 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
succeed 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
mr 1
holder 1
i 1
shall 1
now 1
continue 1
my 1
investigations 1
outside 1
he 1
went 1
alone 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
request 1
for 1
he 1
explained 1
that 1
any 1
unnecessary 1
footmarks 1
might 1
make 1
his 1
task 1
more 1
difficult 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
more 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
returning 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
his 1
feet 1
heavy 1
with 1
snow 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
inscrutable 1
as 1
ever 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
now 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
see 1
mr 1
holder 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
can 1
serve 1
you 1
best 1
by 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
rooms 1
but 1
the 1
gems 1
mr 1
holmes 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
the 1
banker 1
wrung 1
his 1
hands 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
see 1
them 1
again 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
my 1
son 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
hopes 1
my 1
opinion 1
is 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
altered 1
then 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
what 1
was 1
this 1
dark 1
business 1
which 1
was 1
acted 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
my 1
baker 1
street 1
rooms 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
between 1
nine 1
and 1
ten 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
can 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
clearer 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
carte 1
blanche 1
to 1
act 1
for 1
you 1
provided 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
get 1
back 1
the 1
gems 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
place 1
no 1
limit 1
on 1
the 1
sum 1
i 1
may 1
draw 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
fortune 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
back 1
very 1
good 1
i 1
shall 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
matter 1
between 1
this 1
and 1
then 1
goodbye 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
here 1
again 1
before 1
evening 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
companions 1
mind 1
was 1
now 1
made 1
up 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
although 1
what 1
his 1
conclusions 1
were 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
could 1
even 1
dimly 1
imagine 1
several 1
times 1
during 1
our 1
homeward 1
journey 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
sound 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
but 1
he 1
always 1
glided 1
away 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
gave 1
it 1
over 1
in 1
despair 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
three 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
our 1
rooms 1
once 1
more 1
he 1
hurried 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
was 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
dressed 1
as 1
a 1
common 1
loafer 1
with 1
his 1
collar 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
shiny 1
seedy 1
coat 1
his 1
red 1
cravat 1
and 1
his 1
worn 1
boots 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
sample 1
of 1
the 1
class 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
glancing 1
into 1
the 1
glass 1
above 1
the 1
fireplace 1
i 1
only 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
watson 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
it 1
wont 1
do 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
trail 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
or 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
following 1
a 1
willothewisp 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
know 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
he 1
cut 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
beef 1
from 1
the 1
joint 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
sandwiched 1
it 1
between 1
two 1
rounds 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
thrusting 1
this 1
rude 1
meal 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
he 1
started 1
off 1
upon 1
his 1
expedition 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
finished 1
my 1
tea 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
evidently 1
in 1
excellent 1
spirits 1
swinging 1
an 1
old 1
elasticsided 1
boot 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
he 1
chucked 1
it 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
helped 1
himself 1
to 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
i 1
only 1
looked 1
in 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
right 1
on 1
where 1
to 1
oh 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
west 1
end 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
i 1
get 1
back 1
dont 1
wait 1
up 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
case 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
late 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
getting 1
on 1
oh 1
so 1
so 1
nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
of 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
streatham 1
since 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
call 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
sweet 1
little 1
problem 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
however 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
sit 1
gossiping 1
here 1
but 1
must 1
get 1
these 1
disreputable 1
clothes 1
off 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
highly 1
respectable 1
self 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
stronger 1
reasons 1
for 1
satisfaction 1
than 1
his 1
words 1
alone 1
would 1
imply 1
his 1
eyes 1
twinkled 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
even 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
colour 1
upon 1
his 1
sallow 1
cheeks 1
he 1
hastened 1
upstairs 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
slam 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
which 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
off 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
congenial 1
hunt 1
i 1
waited 1
until 1
midnight 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
return 1
so 1
i 1
retired 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
uncommon 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
away 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
on 1
end 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
a 1
scent 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
lateness 1
caused 1
me 1
no 1
surprise 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
what 1
hour 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
as 1
fresh 1
and 1
trim 1
as 1
possible 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
beginning 1
without 1
you 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
you 1
remember 1
that 1
our 1
client 1
has 1
rather 1
an 1
early 1
appointment 1
this 1
morning 1
why 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
nine 1
now 1
i 1
answered 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
that 1
were 1
he 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
friend 1
the 1
financier 1
i 1
was 1
shocked 1
by 1
the 1
change 1
which 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
naturally 1
of 1
a 1
broad 1
and 1
massive 1
mould 1
was 1
now 1
pinched 1
and 1
fallen 1
in 1
while 1
his 1
hair 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
shade 1
whiter 1
he 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
weariness 1
and 1
lethargy 1
which 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
painful 1
than 1
his 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
dropped 1
heavily 1
into 1
the 1
armchair 1
which 1
i 1
pushed 1
forward 1
for 1
him 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
severely 1
tried 1
said 1
he 1
only 1
two 1
days 1
ago 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
man 1
without 1
a 1
care 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
left 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
and 1
dishonoured 1
age 1
one 1
sorrow 1
comes 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
heels 1
of 1
another 1
my 1
niece 1
mary 1
has 1
deserted 1
me 1
deserted 1
you 1
yes 1
her 1
bed 1
this 1
morning 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
slept 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
a 1
note 1
for 1
me 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
hall 1
table 1
i 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
sorrow 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
anger 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
married 1
my 1
boy 1
all 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
with 1
him 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
thoughtless 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
that 1
remark 1
that 1
she 1
refers 1
in 1
this 1
note 1
my 1
dearest 1
unclei 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
brought 1
trouble 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
acted 1
differently 1
this 1
terrible 1
misfortune 1
might 1
never 1
have 1
occurred 1
i 1
cannot 1
with 1
this 1
thought 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
ever 1
again 1
be 1
happy 1
under 1
your 1
roof 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
forever 1
do 1
not 1
worry 1
about 1
my 1
future 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
provided 1
for 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
do 1
not 1
search 1
for 1
me 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
fruitless 1
labour 1
and 1
an 1
illservice 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
life 1
or 1
in 1
death 1
i 1
am 1
ever 1
your 1
lovingmary 1
what 1
could 1
she 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
note 1
mr 1
holmes 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
points 1
to 1
suicide 1
no 1
no 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
it 1
is 1
perhaps 1
the 1
best 1
possible 1
solution 1
i 1
trust 1
mr 1
holder 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
nearing 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
your 1
troubles 1
ha 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
something 1
mr 1
holmes 1
you 1
have 1
learned 1
something 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
gems 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
1000 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
an 1
excessive 1
sum 1
for 1
them 1
i 1
would 1
pay 1
ten 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
unnecessary 1
three 1
thousand 1
will 1
cover 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
reward 1
i 1
fancy 1
have 1
you 1
your 1
checkbook 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
pen 1
better 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
4000 1
pounds 1
with 1
a 1
dazed 1
face 1
the 1
banker 1
made 1
out 1
the 1
required 1
check 1
holmes 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
his 1
desk 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
triangular 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
with 1
three 1
gems 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
a 1
shriek 1
of 1
joy 1
our 1
client 1
clutched 1
it 1
up 1
you 1
have 1
it 1
he 1
gasped 1
i 1
am 1
saved 1
i 1
am 1
saved 1
the 1
reaction 1
of 1
joy 1
was 1
as 1
passionate 1
as 1
his 1
grief 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
he 1
hugged 1
his 1
recovered 1
gems 1
to 1
his 1
bosom 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
other 1
thing 1
you 1
owe 1
mr 1
holder 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
rather 1
sternly 1
owe 1
he 1
caught 1
up 1
a 1
pen 1
name 1
the 1
sum 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
pay 1
it 1
no 1
the 1
debt 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
owe 1
a 1
very 1
humble 1
apology 1
to 1
that 1
noble 1
lad 1
your 1
son 1
who 1
has 1
carried 1
himself 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
proud 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
own 1
son 1
do 1
should 1
i 1
ever 1
chance 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
arthur 1
who 1
took 1
them 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
yesterday 1
and 1
i 1
repeat 1
today 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
let 1
us 1
hurry 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
known 1
he 1
knows 1
it 1
already 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
cleared 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
story 1
i 1
told 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
to 1
add 1
the 1
very 1
few 1
details 1
which 1
were 1
not 1
yet 1
quite 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
your 1
news 1
of 1
this 1
morning 1
however 1
may 1
open 1
his 1
lips 1
for 1
heavens 1
sake 1
tell 1
me 1
then 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
mystery 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
reached 1
it 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
first 1
that 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
hardest 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
understanding 1
between 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
and 1
your 1
niece 1
mary 1
they 1
have 1
now 1
fled 1
together 1
my 1
mary 1
impossible 1
it 1
is 1
unfortunately 1
more 1
than 1
possible 1
it 1
is 1
certain 1
neither 1
you 1
nor 1
your 1
son 1
knew 1
the 1
true 1
character 1
of 1
this 1
man 1
when 1
you 1
admitted 1
him 1
into 1
your 1
family 1
circle 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
men 1
in 1
englanda 1
ruined 1
gambler 1
an 1
absolutely 1
desperate 1
villain 1
a 1
man 1
without 1
heart 1
or 1
conscience 1
your 1
niece 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
such 1
men 1
when 1
he 1
breathed 1
his 1
vows 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
to 1
a 1
hundred 1
before 1
her 1
she 1
flattered 1
herself 1
that 1
she 1
alone 1
had 1
touched 1
his 1
heart 1
the 1
devil 1
knows 1
best 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
became 1
his 1
tool 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
seeing 1
him 1
nearly 1
every 1
evening 1
i 1
cannot 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
believe 1
it 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
an 1
ashen 1
face 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
occurred 1
in 1
your 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
your 1
niece 1
when 1
you 1
had 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
gone 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
slipped 1
down 1
and 1
talked 1
to 1
her 1
lover 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
which 1
leads 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
his 1
footmarks 1
had 1
pressed 1
right 1
through 1
the 1
snow 1
so 1
long 1
had 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
his 1
wicked 1
lust 1
for 1
gold 1
kindled 1
at 1
the 1
news 1
and 1
he 1
bent 1
her 1
to 1
his 1
will 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
you 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
women 1
in 1
whom 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
lover 1
extinguishes 1
all 1
other 1
loves 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
she 1
had 1
hardly 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
instructions 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
you 1
coming 1
downstairs 1
on 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
rapidly 1
and 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
escapade 1
with 1
her 1
woodenlegged 1
lover 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
perfectly 1
true 1
your 1
boy 1
arthur 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
after 1
his 1
interview 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
he 1
slept 1
badly 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
uneasiness 1
about 1
his 1
club 1
debts 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
soft 1
tread 1
pass 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
looking 1
out 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
cousin 1
walking 1
very 1
stealthily 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
until 1
she 1
disappeared 1
into 1
your 1
dressingroom 1
petrified 1
with 1
astonishment 1
the 1
lad 1
slipped 1
on 1
some 1
clothes 1
and 1
waited 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
would 1
come 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
affair 1
presently 1
she 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
again 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
passagelamp 1
your 1
son 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
carried 1
the 1
precious 1
coronet 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
she 1
passed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
he 1
thrilling 1
with 1
horror 1
ran 1
along 1
and 1
slipped 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
near 1
your 1
door 1
whence 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
beneath 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
stealthily 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
hand 1
out 1
the 1
coronet 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
then 1
closing 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
hurry 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
passing 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
stood 1
hid 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
any 1
action 1
without 1
a 1
horrible 1
exposure 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
but 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
realised 1
how 1
crushing 1
a 1
misfortune 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
how 1
allimportant 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
he 1
rushed 1
down 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
bare 1
feet 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
sprang 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
dark 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
arthur 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
struggle 1
between 1
them 1
your 1
lad 1
tugging 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
his 1
opponent 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
scuffle 1
your 1
son 1
struck 1
sir 1
george 1
and 1
cut 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
eye 1
then 1
something 1
suddenly 1
snapped 1
and 1
your 1
son 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
rushed 1
back 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
ascended 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
observed 1
that 1
the 1
coronet 1
had 1
been 1
twisted 1
in 1
the 1
struggle 1
and 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
when 1
you 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
gasped 1
the 1
banker 1
you 1
then 1
roused 1
his 1
anger 1
by 1
calling 1
him 1
names 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
deserved 1
your 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
explain 1
the 1
true 1
state 1
of 1
affairs 1
without 1
betraying 1
one 1
who 1
certainly 1
deserved 1
little 1
enough 1
consideration 1
at 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
more 1
chivalrous 1
view 1
however 1
and 1
preserved 1
her 1
secret 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
she 1
shrieked 1
and 1
fainted 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
coronet 1
cried 1
mr 1
holder 1
oh 1
my 1
god 1
what 1
a 1
blind 1
fool 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
his 1
asking 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
the 1
dear 1
fellow 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
missing 1
piece 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
struggle 1
how 1
cruelly 1
i 1
have 1
misjudged 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
continued 1
holmes 1
i 1
at 1
once 1
went 1
very 1
carefully 1
round 1
it 1
to 1
observe 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
traces 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
which 1
might 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
none 1
had 1
fallen 1
since 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
strong 1
frost 1
to 1
preserve 1
impressions 1
i 1
passed 1
along 1
the 1
tradesmens 1
path 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
all 1
trampled 1
down 1
and 1
indistinguishable 1
just 1
beyond 1
it 1
however 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
a 1
woman 1
had 1
stood 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
round 1
impressions 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
i 1
could 1
even 1
tell 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
disturbed 1
for 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
run 1
back 1
swiftly 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
was 1
shown 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
toe 1
and 1
light 1
heel 1
marks 1
while 1
woodenleg 1
had 1
waited 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
then 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
i 1
thought 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
maid 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
had 1
already 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
inquiry 1
showed 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
i 1
passed 1
round 1
the 1
garden 1
without 1
seeing 1
anything 1
more 1
than 1
random 1
tracks 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
police 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
and 1
complex 1
story 1
was 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
line 1
of 1
tracks 1
of 1
a 1
booted 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
second 1
double 1
line 1
which 1
i 1
saw 1
with 1
delight 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
naked 1
feet 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
convinced 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
your 1
son 1
the 1
first 1
had 1
walked 1
both 1
ways 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
run 1
swiftly 1
and 1
as 1
his 1
tread 1
was 1
marked 1
in 1
places 1
over 1
the 1
depression 1
of 1
the 1
boot 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
followed 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
found 1
they 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
where 1
boots 1
had 1
worn 1
all 1
the 1
snow 1
away 1
while 1
waiting 1
then 1
i 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
or 1
more 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
i 1
saw 1
where 1
boots 1
had 1
faced 1
round 1
where 1
the 1
snow 1
was 1
cut 1
up 1
as 1
though 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
struggle 1
and 1
finally 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
had 1
fallen 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
mistaken 1
boots 1
had 1
then 1
run 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
another 1
little 1
smudge 1
of 1
blood 1
showed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
hurt 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleared 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
that 1
clue 1
on 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
however 1
i 1
examined 1
as 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
sill 1
and 1
framework 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
with 1
my 1
lens 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
at 1
once 1
see 1
that 1
someone 1
had 1
passed 1
out 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
outline 1
of 1
an 1
instep 1
where 1
the 1
wet 1
foot 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
coming 1
in 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
beginning 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
form 1
an 1
opinion 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
a 1
man 1
had 1
waited 1
outside 1
the 1
window 1
someone 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
gems 1
the 1
deed 1
had 1
been 1
overseen 1
by 1
your 1
son 1
he 1
had 1
pursued 1
the 1
thief 1
had 1
struggled 1
with 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
each 1
tugged 1
at 1
the 1
coronet 1
their 1
united 1
strength 1
causing 1
injuries 1
which 1
neither 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
effected 1
he 1
had 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
prize 1
but 1
had 1
left 1
a 1
fragment 1
in 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
his 1
opponent 1
so 1
far 1
i 1
was 1
clear 1
the 1
question 1
now 1
was 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
it 1
brought 1
him 1
the 1
coronet 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
maxim 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
excluded 1
the 1
impossible 1
whatever 1
remains 1
however 1
improbable 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
truth 1
now 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
you 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
down 1
so 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
your 1
niece 1
and 1
the 1
maids 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
maids 1
why 1
should 1
your 1
son 1
allow 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
accused 1
in 1
their 1
place 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
possible 1
reason 1
as 1
he 1
loved 1
his 1
cousin 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
explanation 1
why 1
he 1
should 1
retain 1
her 1
secretthe 1
more 1
so 1
as 1
the 1
secret 1
was 1
a 1
disgraceful 1
one 1
when 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
at 1
that 1
window 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
fainted 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
coronet 1
again 1
my 1
conjecture 1
became 1
a 1
certainty 1
and 1
who 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
who 1
was 1
her 1
confederate 1
a 1
lover 1
evidently 1
for 1
who 1
else 1
could 1
outweigh 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
gratitude 1
which 1
she 1
must 1
feel 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
went 1
out 1
little 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
circle 1
of 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
limited 1
one 1
but 1
among 1
them 1
was 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
evil 1
reputation 1
among 1
women 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
he 1
who 1
wore 1
those 1
boots 1
and 1
retained 1
the 1
missing 1
gems 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
arthur 1
had 1
discovered 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
still 1
flatter 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
for 1
the 1
lad 1
could 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
without 1
compromising 1
his 1
own 1
family 1
well 1
your 1
own 1
good 1
sense 1
will 1
suggest 1
what 1
measures 1
i 1
took 1
next 1
i 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
loafer 1
to 1
sir 1
georges 1
house 1
managed 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
his 1
valet 1
learned 1
that 1
his 1
master 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
finally 1
at 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
six 1
shillings 1
made 1
all 1
sure 1
by 1
buying 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
his 1
castoff 1
shoes 1
with 1
these 1
i 1
journeyed 1
down 1
to 1
streatham 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
exactly 1
fitted 1
the 1
tracks 1
i 1
saw 1
an 1
illdressed 1
vagabond 1
in 1
the 1
lane 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
said 1
mr 1
holder 1
precisely 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
man 1
so 1
i 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
changed 1
my 1
clothes 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
delicate 1
part 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
play 1
then 1
for 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
a 1
prosecution 1
must 1
be 1
avoided 1
to 1
avert 1
scandal 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
astute 1
a 1
villain 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
our 1
hands 1
were 1
tied 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
went 1
and 1
saw 1
him 1
at 1
first 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
denied 1
everything 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
every 1
particular 1
that 1
had 1
occurred 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
bluster 1
and 1
took 1
down 1
a 1
lifepreserver 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
i 1
knew 1
my 1
man 1
however 1
and 1
i 1
clapped 1
a 1
pistol 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
strike 1
then 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
reasonable 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
the 1
stones 1
he 1
held1000 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
that 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shown 1
why 1
dash 1
it 1
all 1
said 1
he 1
ive 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
at 1
six 1
hundred 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
i 1
soon 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
address 1
of 1
the 1
receiver 1
who 1
had 1
them 1
on 1
promising 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
prosecution 1
off 1
i 1
set 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
chaffering 1
i 1
got 1
our 1
stones 1
at 1
1000 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
then 1
i 1
looked 1
in 1
upon 1
your 1
son 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
eventually 1
got 1
to 1
my 1
bed 1
about 1
two 1
oclock 1
after 1
what 1
i 1
may 1
call 1
a 1
really 1
hard 1
days 1
work 1
a 1
day 1
which 1
has 1
saved 1
england 1
from 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
said 1
the 1
banker 1
rising 1
sir 1
i 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
me 1
ungrateful 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
your 1
skill 1
has 1
indeed 1
exceeded 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
must 1
fly 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
to 1
apologise 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
wrong 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
of 1
poor 1
mary 1
it 1
goes 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
heart 1
not 1
even 1
your 1
skill 1
can 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
safely 1
say 1
returned 1
holmes 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
wherever 1
sir 1
george 1
burnwell 1
is 1
it 1
is 1
equally 1
certain 1
too 1
that 1
whatever 1
her 1
sins 1
are 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
receive 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
sufficient 1
punishment 1
xii 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
loves 1
art 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
remarked 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
tossing 1
aside 1
the 1
advertisement 1
sheet 1
of 1
the 1
daily 1
telegraph 1
it 1
is 1
frequently 1
in 1
its 1
least 1
important 1
and 1
lowliest 1
manifestations 1
that 1
the 1
keenest 1
pleasure 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
derived 1
it 1
is 1
pleasant 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
observe 1
watson 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
far 1
grasped 1
this 1
truth 1
that 1
in 1
these 1
little 1
records 1
of 1
our 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
occasionally 1
to 1
embellish 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
prominence 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
many 1
causes 1
celebres 1
and 1
sensational 1
trials 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
figured 1
but 1
rather 1
to 1
those 1
incidents 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
trivial 1
in 1
themselves 1
but 1
which 1
have 1
given 1
room 1
for 1
those 1
faculties 1
of 1
deduction 1
and 1
of 1
logical 1
synthesis 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
special 1
province 1
and 1
yet 1
said 1
i 1
smiling 1
i 1
cannot 1
quite 1
hold 1
myself 1
absolved 1
from 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
urged 1
against 1
my 1
records 1
you 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
he 1
observed 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
glowing 1
cinder 1
with 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
lighting 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
long 1
cherrywood 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
wont 1
to 1
replace 1
his 1
clay 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
disputatious 1
rather 1
than 1
a 1
meditative 1
moodyou 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
in 1
attempting 1
to 1
put 1
colour 1
and 1
life 1
into 1
each 1
of 1
your 1
statements 1
instead 1
of 1
confining 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
placing 1
upon 1
record 1
that 1
severe 1
reasoning 1
from 1
cause 1
to 1
effect 1
which 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
only 1
notable 1
feature 1
about 1
the 1
thing 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
full 1
justice 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
remarked 1
with 1
some 1
coldness 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
repelled 1
by 1
the 1
egotism 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
observed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
strong 1
factor 1
in 1
my 1
friends 1
singular 1
character 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
not 1

conceit 1
said 1
he 1
answering 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
wont 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rather 1
than 1
my 1
words 1
if 1
i 1
claim 1
full 1
justice 1
for 1
my 1
art 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
impersonal 1
thinga 1
thing 1
beyond 1
myself 1
crime 1
is 1
common 1
logic 1
is 1
rare 1
therefore 1
it 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
logic 1
rather 1
than 1
upon 1
the 1
crime 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
dwell 1
you 1
have 1
degraded 1
what 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
into 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
tales 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
cold 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
early 1
spring 1
and 1
we 1
sat 1
after 1
breakfast 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
cheery 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
room 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
a 1
thick 1
fog 1
rolled 1
down 1
between 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
duncoloured 1
houses 1
and 1
the 1
opposing 1
windows 1
loomed 1
like 1
dark 1
shapeless 1
blurs 1
through 1
the 1
heavy 1
yellow 1
wreaths 1
our 1
gas 1
was 1
lit 1
and 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
cloth 1
and 1
glimmer 1
of 1
china 1
and 1
metal 1
for 1
the 1
table 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
cleared 1
yet 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
been 1
silent 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
dipping 1
continuously 1
into 1
the 1
advertisement 1
columns 1
of 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
papers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
having 1
apparently 1
given 1
up 1
his 1
search 1
he 1
had 1
emerged 1
in 1
no 1
very 1
sweet 1
temper 1
to 1
lecture 1
me 1
upon 1
my 1
literary 1
shortcomings 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
remarked 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
long 1
pipe 1
and 1
gazing 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
open 1
to 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
for 1
out 1
of 1
these 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
interest 1
yourself 1
in 1
a 1
fair 1
proportion 1
do 1
not 1
treat 1
of 1
crime 1
in 1
its 1
legal 1
sense 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
small 1
matter 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
the 1
singular 1
experience 1
of 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
the 1
problem 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
bachelor 1
were 1
all 1
matters 1
which 1
are 1
outside 1
the 1
pale 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
but 1
in 1
avoiding 1
the 1
sensational 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
bordered 1
on 1
the 1
trivial 1
the 1
end 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
i 1
answered 1
but 1
the 1
methods 1
i 1
hold 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
novel 1
and 1
of 1
interest 1
pshaw 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
what 1
do 1
the 1
public 1
the 1
great 1
unobservant 1
public 1
who 1
could 1
hardly 1
tell 1
a 1
weaver 1
by 1
his 1
tooth 1
or 1
a 1
compositor 1
by 1
his 1
left 1
thumb 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
finer 1
shades 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
deduction 1
but 1
indeed 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
trivial 1
i 1
cannot 1
blame 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
cases 1
are 1
past 1
man 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
criminal 1
man 1
has 1
lost 1
all 1
enterprise 1
and 1
originality 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
practice 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
degenerating 1
into 1
an 1
agency 1
for 1
recovering 1
lost 1
lead 1
pencils 1
and 1
giving 1
advice 1
to 1
young 1
ladies 1
from 1
boardingschools 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
touched 1
bottom 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
this 1
note 1
i 1
had 1
this 1
morning 1
marks 1
my 1
zeropoint 1
i 1
fancy 1
read 1
it 1
he 1
tossed 1
a 1
crumpled 1
letter 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
dated 1
from 1
montague 1
place 1
upon 1
the 1
preceding 1
evening 1
and 1
ran 1
thus 1
dear 1
mr 1
holmesi 1
am 1
very 1
anxious 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
or 1
should 1
not 1
accept 1
a 1
situation 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
governess 1
i 1
shall 1
call 1
at 1
halfpast 1
ten 1
tomorrow 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
inconvenience 1
you 1
yours 1
faithfully 1
violet 1
hunter 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
i 1
asked 1
not 1
i 1
it 1
is 1
halfpast 1
ten 1
now 1
yes 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
is 1
her 1
ring 1
it 1
may 1
turn 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
more 1
interest 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
remember 1
that 1
the 1
affair 1
of 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
mere 1
whim 1
at 1
first 1
developed 1
into 1
a 1
serious 1
investigation 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
also 1
well 1
let 1
us 1
hope 1
so 1
but 1
our 1
doubts 1
will 1
very 1
soon 1
be 1
solved 1
for 1
here 1
unless 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
is 1
the 1
person 1
in 1
question 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
was 1
plainly 1
but 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
with 1
a 1
bright 1
quick 1
face 1
freckled 1
like 1
a 1
plovers 1
egg 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
brisk 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
her 1
own 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
troubling 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
said 1
she 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
rose 1
to 1
greet 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
parents 1
or 1
relations 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
from 1
whom 1
i 1
could 1
ask 1
advice 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
miss 1
hunter 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
to 1
serve 1
you 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
holmes 1
was 1
favourably 1
impressed 1
by 1
the 1
manner 1
and 1
speech 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
client 1
he 1
looked 1
her 1
over 1
in 1
his 1
searching 1
fashion 1
and 1
then 1
composed 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
lids 1
drooping 1
and 1
his 1
fingertips 1
together 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
her 1
story 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
governess 1
for 1
five 1
years 1
said 1
she 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
colonel 1
spence 1
munro 1
but 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
the 1
colonel 1
received 1
an 1
appointment 1
at 1
halifax 1
in 1
nova 1
scotia 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
children 1
over 1
to 1
america 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
without 1
a 1
situation 1
i 1
advertised 1
and 1
i 1
answered 1
advertisements 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
little 1
money 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
saved 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
short 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
wits 1
end 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
wellknown 1
agency 1
for 1
governesses 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
end 1
called 1
westaways 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
about 1
once 1
a 1
week 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
anything 1
had 1
turned 1
up 1
which 1
might 1
suit 1
me 1
westaway 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
founder 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
managed 1
by 1
miss 1
stoper 1
she 1
sits 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
little 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
are 1
seeking 1
employment 1
wait 1
in 1
an 1
anteroom 1
and 1
are 1
then 1
shown 1
in 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
when 1
she 1
consults 1
her 1
ledgers 1
and 1
sees 1
whether 1
she 1
has 1
anything 1
which 1
would 1
suit 1
them 1
well 1
when 1
i 1
called 1
last 1
week 1
i 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
little 1
office 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
miss 1
stoper 1
was 1
not 1
alone 1
a 1
prodigiously 1
stout 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
heavy 1
chin 1
which 1
rolled 1
down 1
in 1
fold 1
upon 1
fold 1
over 1
his 1
throat 1
sat 1
at 1
her 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
glasses 1
on 1
his 1
nose 1
looking 1
very 1
earnestly 1
at 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
entered 1
as 1
i 1
came 1
in 1
he 1
gave 1
quite 1
a 1
jump 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
turned 1
quickly 1
to 1
miss 1
stoper 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
ask 1
for 1
anything 1
better 1
capital 1
capital 1
he 1
seemed 1
quite 1
enthusiastic 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
genial 1
fashion 1
he 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
comfortablelooking 1
man 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
you 1
are 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
situation 1
miss 1
he 1
asked 1
yes 1
sir 1
as 1
governess 1
yes 1
sir 1
and 1
what 1
salary 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
i 1
had 1
4 1
pounds 1
a 1
month 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
place 1
with 1
colonel 1
spence 1
munro 1
oh 1
tut 1
tut 1
sweatingrank 1
sweating 1
he 1
cried 1
throwing 1
his 1
fat 1
hands 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
boiling 1
passion 1
how 1
could 1
anyone 1
offer 1
so 1
pitiful 1
a 1
sum 1
to 1
a 1
lady 1
with 1
such 1
attractions 1
and 1
accomplishments 1
my 1
accomplishments 1
sir 1
may 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
imagine 1
said 1
i 1
a 1
little 1
french 1
a 1
little 1
german 1
music 1
and 1
drawing 1
tut 1
tut 1
he 1
cried 1
this 1
is 1
all 1
quite 1
beside 1
the 1
question 1
the 1
point 1
is 1
have 1
you 1
or 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
the 1
bearing 1
and 1
deportment 1
of 1
a 1
lady 1
there 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
nutshell 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fitted 1
for 1
the 1
rearing 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
who 1
may 1
some 1
day 1
play 1
a 1
considerable 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
why 1
then 1
how 1
could 1
any 1
gentleman 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
condescend 1
to 1
accept 1
anything 1
under 1
the 1
three 1
figures 1
your 1
salary 1
with 1
me 1
madam 1
would 1
commence 1
at 1
100 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
mr 1
holmes 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
destitute 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
such 1
an 1
offer 1
seemed 1
almost 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
the 1
gentleman 1
however 1
seeing 1
perhaps 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
incredulity 1
upon 1
my 1
face 1
opened 1
a 1
pocketbook 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
note 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
custom 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
pleasant 1
fashion 1
until 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
just 1
two 1
little 1
shining 1
slits 1
amid 1
the 1
white 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
advance 1
to 1
my 1
young 1
ladies 1
half 1
their 1
salary 1
beforehand 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
meet 1
any 1
little 1
expenses 1
of 1
their 1
journey 1
and 1
their 1
wardrobe 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
fascinating 1
and 1
so 1
thoughtful 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
debt 1
to 1
my 1
tradesmen 1
the 1
advance 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
convenience 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
unnatural 1
about 1
the 1
whole 1
transaction 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
before 1
i 1
quite 1
committed 1
myself 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
where 1
you 1
live 1
sir 1
said 1
i 1
hampshire 1
charming 1
rural 1
place 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
five 1
miles 1
on 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
winchester 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
lovely 1
country 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
the 1
dearest 1
old 1
countryhouse 1
and 1
my 1
duties 1
sir 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
one 1
childone 1
dear 1
little 1
romper 1
just 1
six 1
years 1
old 1
oh 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
killing 1
cockroaches 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
smack 1
smack 1
smack 1
three 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
could 1
wink 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
his 1
eyes 1
into 1
his 1
head 1
again 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
childs 1
amusement 1
but 1
the 1
fathers 1
laughter 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
perhaps 1
he 1
was 1
joking 1
my 1
sole 1
duties 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
are 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
child 1
no 1
no 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
he 1
cried 1
your 1
duty 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
your 1
good 1
sense 1
would 1
suggest 1
to 1
obey 1
any 1
little 1
commands 1
my 1
wife 1
might 1
give 1
provided 1
always 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
such 1
commands 1
as 1
a 1
lady 1
might 1
with 1
propriety 1
obey 1
you 1
see 1
no 1
difficulty 1
heh 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
quite 1
so 1
in 1
dress 1
now 1
for 1
example 1
we 1
are 1
faddy 1
people 1
you 1
knowfaddy 1
but 1
kindhearted 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
asked 1
to 1
wear 1
any 1
dress 1
which 1
we 1
might 1
give 1
you 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
object 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
whim 1
heh 1
no 1
said 1
i 1
considerably 1
astonished 1
at 1
his 1
words 1
or 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
or 1
sit 1
there 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
offensive 1
to 1
you 1
oh 1
no 1
or 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
quite 1
short 1
before 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
my 1
ears 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
observe 1
mr 1
holmes 1
my 1
hair 1
is 1
somewhat 1
luxuriant 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
rather 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
of 1
chestnut 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
considered 1
artistic 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
sacrificing 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
offhand 1
fashion 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
impossible 1
said 1
i 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
me 1
eagerly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
small 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
essential 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
fancy 1
of 1
my 1
wifes 1
and 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
you 1
know 1
madam 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
must 1
be 1
consulted 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
wont 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
no 1
sir 1
i 1
really 1
could 1
not 1
i 1
answered 1
firmly 1
ah 1
very 1
well 1
then 1
that 1
quite 1
settles 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
because 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
you 1
would 1
really 1
have 1
done 1
very 1
nicely 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
miss 1
stoper 1
i 1
had 1
best 1
inspect 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
young 1
ladies 1
the 1
manageress 1
had 1
sat 1
all 1
this 1
while 1
busy 1
with 1
her 1
papers 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
me 1
now 1
with 1
so 1
much 1
annoyance 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
suspecting 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
a 1
handsome 1
commission 1
through 1
my 1
refusal 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
your 1
name 1
to 1
be 1
kept 1
upon 1
the 1
books 1
she 1
asked 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
miss 1
stoper 1
well 1
really 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
useless 1
since 1
you 1
refuse 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
offers 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
said 1
she 1
sharply 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
expect 1
us 1
to 1
exert 1
ourselves 1
to 1
find 1
another 1
such 1
opening 1
for 1
you 1
goodday 1
to 1
you 1
miss 1
hunter 1
she 1
struck 1
a 1
gong 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
shown 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
page 1
well 1
mr 1
holmes 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
lodgings 1
and 1
found 1
little 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
cupboard 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
bills 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
ask 1
myself 1
whether 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
a 1
very 1
foolish 1
thing 1
after 1
all 1
if 1
these 1
people 1
had 1
strange 1
fads 1
and 1
expected 1
obedience 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
matters 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
least 1
ready 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
their 1
eccentricity 1
very 1
few 1
governesses 1
in 1
england 1
are 1
getting 1
100 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
besides 1
what 1
use 1
was 1
my 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
many 1
people 1
are 1
improved 1
by 1
wearing 1
it 1
short 1
and 1
perhaps 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
among 1
the 1
number 1
next 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
i 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
almost 1
overcome 1
my 1
pride 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
agency 1
and 1
inquire 1
whether 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
still 1
open 1
when 1
i 1
received 1
this 1
letter 1
from 1
the 1
gentleman 1
himself 1
i 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
near 1
winchester 1
dear 1
miss 1
huntermiss 1
stoper 1
has 1
very 1
kindly 1
given 1
me 1
your 1
address 1
and 1
i 1
write 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
whether 1
you 1
have 1
reconsidered 1
your 1
decision 1
my 1
wife 1
is 1
very 1
anxious 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
come 1
for 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
much 1
attracted 1
by 1
my 1
description 1
of 1
you 1
we 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
give 1
30 1
pounds 1
a 1
quarter 1
or 1
120 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
any 1
little 1
inconvenience 1
which 1
our 1
fads 1
may 1
cause 1
you 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
exacting 1
after 1
all 1
my 1
wife 1
is 1
fond 1
of 1
a 1
particular 1
shade 1
of 1
electric 1
blue 1
and 1
would 1
like 1
you 1
to 1
wear 1
such 1
a 1
dress 1
indoors 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
however 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
purchasing 1
one 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
one 1
belonging 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
daughter 1
alice 1
now 1
in 1
philadelphia 1
which 1
would 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
fit 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
then 1
as 1
to 1
sitting 1
here 1
or 1
there 1
or 1
amusing 1
yourself 1
in 1
any 1
manner 1
indicated 1
that 1
need 1
cause 1
you 1
no 1
inconvenience 1
as 1
regards 1
your 1
hair 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
a 1
pity 1
especially 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
remarking 1
its 1
beauty 1
during 1
our 1
short 1
interview 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
remain 1
firm 1
upon 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
increased 1
salary 1
may 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
your 1
duties 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
child 1
is 1
concerned 1
are 1
very 1
light 1
now 1
do 1
try 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
meet 1
you 1
with 1
the 1
dogcart 1
at 1
winchester 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
your 1
train 1
yours 1
faithfully 1
jephro 1
rucastle 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
letter 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
received 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
accept 1
it 1
i 1
thought 1
however 1
that 1
before 1
taking 1
the 1
final 1
step 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
submit 1
the 1
whole 1
matter 1
to 1
your 1
consideration 1
well 1
miss 1
hunter 1
if 1
your 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
settles 1
the 1
question 1
said 1
holmes 1
smiling 1
but 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
refuse 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
situation 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
sister 1
of 1
mine 1
apply 1
for 1
what 1

the 1

of 1
it 1
all 1
mr 1
holmes 1
ah 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
data 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
perhaps 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
formed 1
some 1
opinion 1
well 1
there 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
possible 1
solution 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
kind 1
goodnatured 1
man 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
possible 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
lunatic 1
that 1
he 1
desires 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
matter 1
quiet 1
for 1
fear 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
to 1
an 1
asylum 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
humours 1
her 1
fancies 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
outbreak 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
solutionin 1
fact 1
as 1
matters 1
stand 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
probable 1
one 1
but 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
household 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
but 1
the 1
money 1
mr 1
holmes 1
the 1
money 1
well 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
pay 1
is 1
goodtoo 1
good 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
uneasy 1
why 1
should 1
they 1
give 1
you 1
120 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
when 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
their 1
pick 1
for 1
40 1
pounds 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
strong 1
reason 1
behind 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
the 1
circumstances 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
afterwards 1
if 1
i 1
wanted 1
your 1
help 1
i 1
should 1
feel 1
so 1
much 1
stronger 1
if 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
me 1
oh 1
you 1
may 1
carry 1
that 1
feeling 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
little 1
problem 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
which 1
has 1
come 1
my 1
way 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
distinctly 1
novel 1
about 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
features 1
if 1
you 1
should 1
find 1
yourself 1
in 1
doubt 1
or 1
in 1
danger 1
danger 1
what 1
danger 1
do 1
you 1
foresee 1
holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
it 1
would 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
danger 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
define 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
day 1
or 1
night 1
a 1
telegram 1
would 1
bring 1
me 1
down 1
to 1
your 1
help 1
that 1
is 1
enough 1
she 1
rose 1
briskly 1
from 1
her 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
anxiety 1
all 1
swept 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
i 1
shall 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
hampshire 1
quite 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
now 1
i 1
shall 1
write 1
to 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
at 1
once 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
poor 1
hair 1
tonight 1
and 1
start 1
for 1
winchester 1
tomorrow 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
grateful 1
words 1
to 1
holmes 1
she 1
bade 1
us 1
both 1
goodnight 1
and 1
bustled 1
off 1
upon 1
her 1
way 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
we 1
heard 1
her 1
quick 1
firm 1
steps 1
descending 1
the 1
stairs 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
who 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
able 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
herself 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
holmes 1
gravely 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
from 1
her 1
before 1
many 1
days 1
are 1
past 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
long 1
before 1
my 1
friends 1
prediction 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
a 1
fortnight 1
went 1
by 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
frequently 1
found 1
my 1
thoughts 1
turning 1
in 1
her 1
direction 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
strange 1
sidealley 1
of 1
human 1
experience 1
this 1
lonely 1
woman 1
had 1
strayed 1
into 1
the 1
unusual 1
salary 1
the 1
curious 1
conditions 1
the 1
light 1
duties 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
something 1
abnormal 1
though 1
whether 1
a 1
fad 1
or 1
a 1
plot 1
or 1
whether 1
the 1
man 1
were 1
a 1
philanthropist 1
or 1
a 1
villain 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
beyond 1
my 1
powers 1
to 1
determine 1
as 1
to 1
holmes 1
i 1
observed 1
that 1
he 1
sat 1
frequently 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
on 1
end 1
with 1
knitted 1
brows 1
and 1
an 1
abstracted 1
air 1
but 1
he 1
swept 1
the 1
matter 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
when 1
i 1
mentioned 1
it 1
data 1
data 1
data 1
he 1
cried 1
impatiently 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
bricks 1
without 1
clay 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
would 1
always 1
wind 1
up 1
by 1
muttering 1
that 1
no 1
sister 1
of 1
his 1
should 1
ever 1
have 1
accepted 1
such 1
a 1
situation 1
the 1
telegram 1
which 1
we 1
eventually 1
received 1
came 1
late 1
one 1
night 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
turning 1
in 1
and 1
holmes 1
was 1
settling 1
down 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
allnight 1
chemical 1
researches 1
which 1
he 1
frequently 1
indulged 1
in 1
when 1
i 1
would 1
leave 1
him 1
stooping 1
over 1
a 1
retort 1
and 1
a 1
testtube 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
find 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
yellow 1
envelope 1
and 1
then 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
message 1
threw 1
it 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
just 1
look 1
up 1
the 1
trains 1
in 1
bradshaw 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
chemical 1
studies 1
the 1
summons 1
was 1
a 1
brief 1
and 1
urgent 1
one 1
please 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
black 1
swan 1
hotel 1
at 1
winchester 1
at 1
midday 1
tomorrow 1
it 1
said 1
do 1
come 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
my 1
wits 1
end 1
hunter 1
will 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
asked 1
holmes 1
glancing 1
up 1
i 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
just 1
look 1
it 1
up 1
then 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
train 1
at 1
halfpast 1
nine 1
said 1
i 1
glancing 1
over 1
my 1
bradshaw 1
it 1
is 1
due 1
at 1
winchester 1
at 1
1130 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
very 1
nicely 1
then 1
perhaps 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
postpone 1
my 1
analysis 1
of 1
the 1
acetones 1
as 1
we 1
may 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
our 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
by 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
upon 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
english 1
capital 1
holmes 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
but 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
hampshire 1
border 1
he 1
threw 1
them 1
down 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
admire 1
the 1
scenery 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
ideal 1
spring 1
day 1
a 1
light 1
blue 1
sky 1
flecked 1
with 1
little 1
fleecy 1
white 1
clouds 1
drifting 1
across 1
from 1
west 1
to 1
east 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
very 1
brightly 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
exhilarating 1
nip 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
which 1
set 1
an 1
edge 1
to 1
a 1
mans 1
energy 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
countryside 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
rolling 1
hills 1
around 1
aldershot 1
the 1
little 1
red 1
and 1
grey 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
farmsteadings 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
light 1
green 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
foliage 1
are 1
they 1
not 1
fresh 1
and 1
beautiful 1
i 1
cried 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
fresh 1
from 1
the 1
fogs 1
of 1
baker 1
street 1
but 1
holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
curses 1
of 1
a 1
mind 1
with 1
a 1
turn 1
like 1
mine 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
look 1
at 1
everything 1
with 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
special 1
subject 1
you 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
scattered 1
houses 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
impressed 1
by 1
their 1
beauty 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
thought 1
which 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
their 1
isolation 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
impunity 1
with 1
which 1
crime 1
may 1
be 1
committed 1
there 1
good 1
heavens 1
i 1
cried 1
who 1
would 1
associate 1
crime 1
with 1
these 1
dear 1
old 1
homesteads 1
they 1
always 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
certain 1
horror 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
watson 1
founded 1
upon 1
my 1
experience 1
that 1
the 1
lowest 1
and 1
vilest 1
alleys 1
in 1
london 1
do 1
not 1
present 1
a 1
more 1
dreadful 1
record 1
of 1
sin 1
than 1
does 1
the 1
smiling 1
and 1
beautiful 1
countryside 1
you 1
horrify 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
reason 1
is 1
very 1
obvious 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
public 1
opinion 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
what 1
the 1
law 1
cannot 1
accomplish 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
lane 1
so 1
vile 1
that 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
tortured 1
child 1
or 1
the 1
thud 1
of 1
a 1
drunkards 1
blow 1
does 1
not 1
beget 1
sympathy 1
and 1
indignation 1
among 1
the 1
neighbours 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
whole 1
machinery 1
of 1
justice 1
is 1
ever 1
so 1
close 1
that 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
complaint 1
can 1
set 1
it 1
going 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
step 1
between 1
the 1
crime 1
and 1
the 1
dock 1
but 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
lonely 1
houses 1
each 1
in 1
its 1
own 1
fields 1
filled 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
with 1
poor 1
ignorant 1
folk 1
who 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
deeds 1
of 1
hellish 1
cruelty 1
the 1
hidden 1
wickedness 1
which 1
may 1
go 1
on 1
year 1
in 1
year 1
out 1
in 1
such 1
places 1
and 1
none 1
the 1
wiser 1
had 1
this 1
lady 1
who 1
appeals 1
to 1
us 1
for 1
help 1
gone 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
winchester 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
fear 1
for 1
her 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
five 1
miles 1
of 1
country 1
which 1
makes 1
the 1
danger 1
still 1
it 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
personally 1
threatened 1
no 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
come 1
to 1
winchester 1
to 1
meet 1
us 1
she 1
can 1
get 1
away 1
quite 1
so 1
she 1
has 1
her 1
freedom 1
what 1
can 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
then 1
can 1
you 1
suggest 1
no 1
explanation 1
i 1
have 1
devised 1
seven 1
separate 1
explanations 1
each 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
cover 1
the 1
facts 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
them 1
but 1
which 1
of 1
these 1
is 1
correct 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
determined 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
information 1
which 1
we 1
shall 1
no 1
doubt 1
find 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
well 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
tower 1
of 1
the 1
cathedral 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
all 1
that 1
miss 1
hunter 1
has 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
black 1
swan 1
is 1
an 1
inn 1
of 1
repute 1
in 1
the 1
high 1
street 1
at 1
no 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
she 1
had 1
engaged 1
a 1
sittingroom 1
and 1
our 1
lunch 1
awaited 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
delighted 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
she 1
said 1
earnestly 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
both 1
but 1
indeed 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
your 1
advice 1
will 1
be 1
altogether 1
invaluable 1
to 1
me 1
pray 1
tell 1
us 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
quick 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
i 1
got 1
his 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
town 1
this 1
morning 1
though 1
he 1
little 1
knew 1
for 1
what 1
purpose 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
everything 1
in 1
its 1
due 1
order 1
holmes 1
thrust 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
composed 1
himself 1
to 1
listen 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
met 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
with 1
no 1
actual 1
illtreatment 1
from 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
them 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
understand 1
their 1
reasons 1
for 1
their 1
conduct 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
occurred 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
met 1
me 1
here 1
and 1
drove 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
dogcart 1
to 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
it 1
is 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
beautifully 1
situated 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
beautiful 1
in 1
itself 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
large 1
square 1
block 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
whitewashed 1
but 1
all 1
stained 1
and 1
streaked 1
with 1
damp 1
and 1
bad 1
weather 1
there 1
are 1
grounds 1
round 1
it 1
woods 1
on 1
three 1
sides 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fourth 1
a 1
field 1
which 1
slopes 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
southampton 1
highroad 1
which 1
curves 1
past 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
this 1
ground 1
in 1
front 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
woods 1
all 1
round 1
are 1
part 1
of 1
lord 1
southertons 1
preserves 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
copper 1
beeches 1
immediately 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
has 1
given 1
its 1
name 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
i 1
was 1
driven 1
over 1
by 1
my 1
employer 1
who 1
was 1
as 1
amiable 1
as 1
ever 1
and 1
was 1
introduced 1
by 1
him 1
that 1
evening 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
truth 1
mr 1
holmes 1
in 1
the 1
conjecture 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
probable 1
in 1
your 1
rooms 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
is 1
not 1
mad 1
i 1
found 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
silent 1
palefaced 1
woman 1
much 1
younger 1
than 1
her 1
husband 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
while 1
he 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
fortyfive 1
from 1
their 1
conversation 1
i 1
have 1
gathered 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
married 1
about 1
seven 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
only 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
wife 1
was 1
the 1
daughter 1
who 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
philadelphia 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
told 1
me 1
in 1
private 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
them 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
unreasoning 1
aversion 1
to 1
her 1
stepmother 1
as 1
the 1
daughter 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
less 1
than 1
twenty 1
i 1
can 1
quite 1
imagine 1
that 1
her 1
position 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
uncomfortable 1
with 1
her 1
fathers 1
young 1
wife 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
colourless 1
in 1
mind 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
feature 1
she 1
impressed 1
me 1
neither 1
favourably 1
nor 1
the 1
reverse 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
nonentity 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
passionately 1
devoted 1
both 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
her 1
light 1
grey 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
continually 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
noting 1
every 1
little 1
want 1
and 1
forestalling 1
it 1
if 1
possible 1
he 1
was 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
bluff 1
boisterous 1
fashion 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
happy 1
couple 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
secret 1
sorrow 1
this 1
woman 1
she 1
would 1
often 1
be 1
lost 1
in 1
deep 1
thought 1
with 1
the 1
saddest 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
i 1
have 1
surprised 1
her 1
in 1
tears 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
sometimes 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
her 1
child 1
which 1
weighed 1
upon 1
her 1
mind 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
utterly 1
spoiled 1
and 1
so 1
illnatured 1
a 1
little 1
creature 1
he 1
is 1
small 1
for 1
his 1
age 1
with 1
a 1
head 1
which 1
is 1
quite 1
disproportionately 1
large 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
spent 1
in 1
an 1
alternation 1
between 1
savage 1
fits 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
gloomy 1
intervals 1
of 1
sulking 1
giving 1
pain 1
to 1
any 1
creature 1
weaker 1
than 1
himself 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
one 1
idea 1
of 1
amusement 1
and 1
he 1
shows 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
talent 1
in 1
planning 1
the 1
capture 1
of 1
mice 1
little 1
birds 1
and 1
insects 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
not 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
creature 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
indeed 1
he 1
has 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
story 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
all 1
details 1
remarked 1
my 1
friend 1
whether 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
relevant 1
or 1
not 1
i 1
shall 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
miss 1
anything 1
of 1
importance 1
the 1
one 1
unpleasant 1
thing 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
struck 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
was 1
the 1
appearance 1
and 1
conduct 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
toller 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
a 1
rough 1
uncouth 1
man 1
with 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
and 1
whiskers 1
and 1
a 1
perpetual 1
smell 1
of 1
drink 1
twice 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
them 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
quite 1
drunk 1
and 1
yet 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
it 1
his 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
tall 1
and 1
strong 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
sour 1
face 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
and 1
much 1
less 1
amiable 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
most 1
unpleasant 1
couple 1
but 1
fortunately 1
i 1
spend 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
which 1
are 1
next 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
at 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
very 1
quiet 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
came 1
down 1
just 1
after 1
breakfast 1
and 1
whispered 1
something 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
oh 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
turning 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
much 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
miss 1
hunter 1
for 1
falling 1
in 1
with 1
our 1
whims 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
detracted 1
in 1
the 1
tiniest 1
iota 1
from 1
your 1
appearance 1
we 1
shall 1
now 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
electricblue 1
dress 1
will 1
become 1
you 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
we 1
should 1
both 1
be 1
extremely 1
obliged 1
the 1
dress 1
which 1
i 1
found 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
shade 1
of 1
blue 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
excellent 1
material 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
beige 1
but 1
it 1
bore 1
unmistakable 1
signs 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
worn 1
before 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
better 1
fit 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
measured 1
for 1
it 1
both 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
expressed 1
a 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
which 1
seemed 1
quite 1
exaggerated 1
in 1
its 1
vehemence 1
they 1
were 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
drawingroom 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
room 1
stretching 1
along 1
the 1
entire 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
three 1
long 1
windows 1
reaching 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
a 1
chair 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
central 1
window 1
with 1
its 1
back 1
turned 1
towards 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
i 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
then 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
the 1
funniest 1
stories 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
you 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
how 1
comical 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
i 1
laughed 1
until 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
weary 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
however 1
who 1
has 1
evidently 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
humour 1
never 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
smiled 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
a 1
sad 1
anxious 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
after 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
suddenly 1
remarked 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
little 1
edward 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
two 1
days 1
later 1
this 1
same 1
performance 1
was 1
gone 1
through 1
under 1
exactly 1
similar 1
circumstances 1
again 1
i 1
changed 1
my 1
dress 1
again 1
i 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
again 1
i 1
laughed 1
very 1
heartily 1
at 1
the 1
funny 1
stories 1
of 1
which 1
my 1
employer 1
had 1
an 1
immense 1
repertoire 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
told 1
inimitably 1
then 1
he 1
handed 1
me 1
a 1
yellowbacked 1
novel 1
and 1
moving 1
my 1
chair 1
a 1
little 1
sideways 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
shadow 1
might 1
not 1
fall 1
upon 1
the 1
page 1
he 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
aloud 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
read 1
for 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
beginning 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
a 1
chapter 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
sentence 1
he 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
cease 1
and 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
you 1
can 1
easily 1
imagine 1
mr 1
holmes 1
how 1
curious 1
i 1
became 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
performance 1
could 1
possibly 1
be 1
they 1
were 1
always 1
very 1
careful 1
i 1
observed 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
face 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
became 1
consumed 1
with 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
behind 1
my 1
back 1
at 1
first 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
impossible 1
but 1
i 1
soon 1
devised 1
a 1
means 1
my 1
handmirror 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
so 1
a 1
happy 1
thought 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
concealed 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
the 1
glass 1
in 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
on 1
the 1
next 1
occasion 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
my 1
laughter 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
management 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
disappointed 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
at 1
least 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
first 1
impression 1
at 1
the 1
second 1
glance 1
however 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
southampton 1
road 1
a 1
small 1
bearded 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
grey 1
suit 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
in 1
my 1
direction 1
the 1
road 1
is 1
an 1
important 1
highway 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
usually 1
people 1
there 1
this 1
man 1
however 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
railings 1
which 1
bordered 1
our 1
field 1
and 1
was 1
looking 1
earnestly 1
up 1
i 1
lowered 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
searching 1
gaze 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
convinced 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
divined 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
mirror 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
had 1
seen 1
what 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
she 1
rose 1
at 1
once 1
jephro 1
said 1
she 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
impertinent 1
fellow 1
upon 1
the 1
road 1
there 1
who 1
stares 1
up 1
at 1
miss 1
hunter 1
no 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
miss 1
hunter 1
he 1
asked 1
no 1
i 1
know 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
dear 1
me 1
how 1
very 1
impertinent 1
kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
motion 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
surely 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
no 1
no 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
him 1
loitering 1
here 1
always 1
kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
wave 1
him 1
away 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
drew 1
down 1
the 1
blind 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
and 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
sat 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
nor 1
have 1
i 1
worn 1
the 1
blue 1
dress 1
nor 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
pray 1
continue 1
said 1
holmes 1
your 1
narrative 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
one 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
rather 1
disconnected 1
i 1
fear 1
and 1
there 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
little 1
relation 1
between 1
the 1
different 1
incidents 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
speak 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
day 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
outhouse 1
which 1
stands 1
near 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
it 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
rattling 1
of 1
a 1
chain 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
animal 1
moving 1
about 1
look 1
in 1
here 1
said 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
showing 1
me 1
a 1
slit 1
between 1
two 1
planks 1
is 1
he 1
not 1
a 1
beauty 1
i 1
looked 1
through 1
and 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
two 1
glowing 1
eyes 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
vague 1
figure 1
huddled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
dont 1
be 1
frightened 1
said 1
my 1
employer 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
start 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
its 1
only 1
carlo 1
my 1
mastiff 1
i 1
call 1
him 1
mine 1
but 1
really 1
old 1
toller 1
my 1
groom 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
him 1
we 1
feed 1
him 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
then 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
as 1
keen 1
as 1
mustard 1
toller 1
lets 1
him 1
loose 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
god 1
help 1
the 1
trespasser 1
whom 1
he 1
lays 1
his 1
fangs 1
upon 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
dont 1
you 1
ever 1
on 1
any 1
pretext 1
set 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
the 1
threshold 1
at 1
night 1
for 1
its 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
your 1
life 1
is 1
worth 1
the 1
warning 1
was 1
no 1
idle 1
one 1
for 1
two 1
nights 1
later 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
bedroom 1
window 1
about 1
two 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
moonlight 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
lawn 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
silvered 1
over 1
and 1
almost 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
standing 1
rapt 1
in 1
the 1
peaceful 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
moving 1
under 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
as 1
it 1
emerged 1
into 1
the 1
moonshine 1
i 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
giant 1
dog 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
a 1
calf 1
tawny 1
tinted 1
with 1
hanging 1
jowl 1
black 1
muzzle 1
and 1
huge 1
projecting 1
bones 1
it 1
walked 1
slowly 1
across 1
the 1
lawn 1
and 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
shadow 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
that 1
dreadful 1
sentinel 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
any 1
burglar 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
i 1
had 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
london 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
coil 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
my 1
trunk 1
one 1
evening 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
in 1
bed 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
amuse 1
myself 1
by 1
examining 1
the 1
furniture 1
of 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
by 1
rearranging 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
things 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
two 1
upper 1
ones 1
empty 1
and 1
open 1
the 1
lower 1
one 1
locked 1
i 1
had 1
filled 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
with 1
my 1
linen 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
still 1
much 1
to 1
pack 1
away 1
i 1
was 1
naturally 1
annoyed 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
third 1
drawer 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
fastened 1
by 1
a 1
mere 1
oversight 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
out 1
my 1
bunch 1
of 1
keys 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
key 1
fitted 1
to 1
perfection 1
and 1
i 1
drew 1
the 1
drawer 1
open 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
guess 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
coil 1
of 1
hair 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
thickness 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
obtruded 1
itself 1
upon 1
me 1
how 1
could 1
my 1
hair 1
have 1
been 1
locked 1
in 1
the 1
drawer 1
with 1
trembling 1
hands 1
i 1
undid 1
my 1
trunk 1
turned 1
out 1
the 1
contents 1
and 1
drew 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
my 1
own 1
hair 1
i 1
laid 1
the 1
two 1
tresses 1
together 1
and 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
identical 1
was 1
it 1
not 1
extraordinary 1
puzzle 1
as 1
i 1
would 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
i 1
returned 1
the 1
strange 1
hair 1
to 1
the 1
drawer 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
the 1
rucastles 1
as 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
put 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
by 1
opening 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
locked 1
i 1
am 1
naturally 1
observant 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
remarked 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
soon 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
plan 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
wing 1
however 1
which 1
appeared 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
inhabited 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
door 1
which 1
faced 1
that 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
tollers 1
opened 1
into 1
this 1
suite 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
invariably 1
locked 1
one 1
day 1
however 1
as 1
i 1
ascended 1
the 1
stair 1
i 1
met 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
coming 1
out 1
through 1
this 1
door 1
his 1
keys 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
round 1
jovial 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
accustomed 1
his 1
cheeks 1
were 1
red 1
his 1
brow 1
was 1
all 1
crinkled 1
with 1
anger 1
and 1
the 1
veins 1
stood 1
out 1
at 1
his 1
temples 1
with 1
passion 1
he 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hurried 1
past 1
me 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
or 1
a 1
look 1
this 1
aroused 1
my 1
curiosity 1
so 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
grounds 1
with 1
my 1
charge 1
i 1
strolled 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
there 1
were 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
three 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
simply 1
dirty 1
while 1
the 1
fourth 1
was 1
shuttered 1
up 1
they 1
were 1
evidently 1
all 1
deserted 1
as 1
i 1
strolled 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
glancing 1
at 1
them 1
occasionally 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
looking 1
as 1
merry 1
and 1
jovial 1
as 1
ever 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
me 1
rude 1
if 1
i 1
passed 1
you 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
i 1
was 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
business 1
matters 1
i 1
assured 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
offended 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
said 1
i 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
quite 1
a 1
suite 1
of 1
spare 1
rooms 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
has 1
the 1
shutters 1
up 1
he 1
looked 1
surprised 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
my 1
remark 1
photography 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
hobbies 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
dark 1
room 1
up 1
there 1
but 1
dear 1
me 1
what 1
an 1
observant 1
young 1
lady 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
upon 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
ever 1
believed 1
it 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
jesting 1
tone 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
jest 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
read 1
suspicion 1
there 1
and 1
annoyance 1
but 1
no 1
jest 1
well 1
mr 1
holmes 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
i 1
understood 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
that 1
suite 1
of 1
rooms 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
on 1
fire 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
mere 1
curiosity 1
though 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
share 1
of 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
dutya 1
feeling 1
that 1
some 1
good 1
might 1
come 1
from 1
my 1
penetrating 1
to 1
this 1
place 1
they 1
talk 1
of 1
womans 1
instinct 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
womans 1
instinct 1
which 1
gave 1
me 1
that 1
feeling 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
for 1
any 1
chance 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
forbidden 1
door 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
yesterday 1
that 1
the 1
chance 1
came 1
i 1
may 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
besides 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
both 1
toller 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
find 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
these 1
deserted 1
rooms 1
and 1
i 1
once 1
saw 1
him 1
carrying 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
linen 1
bag 1
with 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
recently 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
hard 1
and 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
drunk 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
there 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
were 1
both 1
downstairs 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
admirable 1
opportunity 1
i 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
gently 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
slipped 1
through 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
passage 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
unpapered 1
and 1
uncarpeted 1
which 1
turned 1
at 1
a 1
right 1
angle 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
round 1
this 1
corner 1
were 1
three 1
doors 1
in 1
a 1
line 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
third 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
open 1
they 1
each 1
led 1
into 1
an 1
empty 1
room 1
dusty 1
and 1
cheerless 1
with 1
two 1
windows 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
so 1
thick 1
with 1
dirt 1
that 1
the 1
evening 1
light 1
glimmered 1
dimly 1
through 1
them 1
the 1
centre 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
and 1
across 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
fastened 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
broad 1
bars 1
of 1
an 1
iron 1
bed 1
padlocked 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
a 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
fastened 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
stout 1
cord 1
the 1
door 1
itself 1
was 1
locked 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
this 1
barricaded 1
door 1
corresponded 1
clearly 1
with 1
the 1
shuttered 1
window 1
outside 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
from 1
beneath 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
darkness 1
evidently 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
skylight 1
which 1
let 1
in 1
light 1
from 1
above 1
as 1
i 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
sinister 1
door 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
secret 1
it 1
might 1
veil 1
i 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
steps 1
within 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
slit 1
of 1
dim 1
light 1
which 1
shone 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
mad 1
unreasoning 1
terror 1
rose 1
up 1
in 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
mr 1
holmes 1
my 1
overstrung 1
nerves 1
failed 1
me 1
suddenly 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
and 1
ranran 1
as 1
though 1
some 1
dreadful 1
hand 1
were 1
behind 1
me 1
clutching 1
at 1
the 1
skirt 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
i 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
who 1
was 1
waiting 1
outside 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
oh 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
frightened 1
i 1
panted 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
ladyyou 1
cannot 1
think 1
how 1
caressing 1
and 1
soothing 1
his 1
manner 1
wasand 1
what 1
has 1
frightened 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
but 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
coaxing 1
he 1
overdid 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
my 1
guard 1
against 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
foolish 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
empty 1
wing 1
i 1
answered 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
lonely 1
and 1
eerie 1
in 1
this 1
dim 1
light 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
again 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
dreadfully 1
still 1
in 1
there 1
only 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
keenly 1
why 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
think 1
i 1
asked 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
lock 1
this 1
door 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
keep 1
people 1
out 1
who 1
have 1
no 1
business 1
there 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
manner 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
well 1
then 1
you 1
know 1
now 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
put 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
that 1
threshold 1
againhere 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
smile 1
hardened 1
into 1
a 1
grin 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
he 1
glared 1
down 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
demonill 1
throw 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
mastiff 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
rushed 1
past 1
him 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
i 1
remember 1
nothing 1
until 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
bed 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
there 1
longer 1
without 1
some 1
advice 1
i 1
was 1
frightened 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
horrible 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
bring 1
you 1
down 1
all 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
curiosity 1
was 1
almost 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
my 1
fears 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
soon 1
made 1
up 1
i 1
would 1
send 1
you 1
a 1
wire 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
cloak 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
which 1
is 1
about 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
feeling 1
very 1
much 1
easier 1
a 1
horrible 1
doubt 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
lest 1
the 1
dog 1
might 1
be 1
loose 1
but 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
toller 1
had 1
drunk 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insensibility 1
that 1
evening 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
household 1
who 1
had 1
any 1
influence 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
creature 1
or 1
who 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
i 1
slipped 1
in 1
in 1
safety 1
and 1
lay 1
awake 1
half 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
my 1
joy 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
seeing 1
you 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
winchester 1
this 1
morning 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
oclock 1
for 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
evening 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
adventures 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
listened 1
spellbound 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
story 1
my 1
friend 1
rose 1
now 1
and 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
and 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
profound 1
gravity 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
is 1
toller 1
still 1
drunk 1
he 1
asked 1
yes 1
i 1
heard 1
his 1
wife 1
tell 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
with 1
him 1
that 1
is 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
rucastles 1
go 1
out 1
tonight 1
yes 1
is 1
there 1
a 1
cellar 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
strong 1
lock 1
yes 1
the 1
winecellar 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
acted 1
all 1
through 1
this 1
matter 1
like 1
a 1
very 1
brave 1
and 1
sensible 1
girl 1
miss 1
hunter 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
perform 1
one 1
more 1
feat 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
ask 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
you 1
a 1
quite 1
exceptional 1
woman 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
by 1
seven 1
oclock 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
rucastles 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
and 1
toller 1
will 1
we 1
hope 1
be 1
incapable 1
there 1
only 1
remains 1
mrs 1
toller 1
who 1
might 1
give 1
the 1
alarm 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
send 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
on 1
some 1
errand 1
and 1
then 1
turn 1
the 1
key 1
upon 1
her 1
you 1
would 1
facilitate 1
matters 1
immensely 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
excellent 1
we 1
shall 1
then 1
look 1
thoroughly 1
into 1
the 1
affair 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
feasible 1
explanation 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
brought 1
there 1
to 1
personate 1
someone 1
and 1
the 1
real 1
person 1
is 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
this 1
chamber 1
that 1
is 1
obvious 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
this 1
prisoner 1
is 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
daughter 1
miss 1
alice 1
rucastle 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right 1
who 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
america 1
you 1
were 1
chosen 1
doubtless 1
as 1
resembling 1
her 1
in 1
height 1
figure 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
your 1
hair 1
hers 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
very 1
possibly 1
in 1
some 1
illness 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
has 1
passed 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
yours 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
also 1
by 1
a 1
curious 1
chance 1
you 1
came 1
upon 1
her 1
tresses 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
some 1
friend 1
of 1
herspossibly 1
her 1
fianceand 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
you 1
wore 1
the 1
girls 1
dress 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
like 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
from 1
your 1
laughter 1
whenever 1
he 1
saw 1
you 1
and 1
afterwards 1
from 1
your 1
gesture 1
that 1
miss 1
rucastle 1
was 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
desired 1
his 1
attentions 1
the 1
dog 1
is 1
let 1
loose 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
prevent 1
him 1
from 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
is 1
fairly 1
clear 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
is 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
has 1
that 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
ejaculated 1
my 1
dear 1
watson 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
medical 1
man 1
are 1
continually 1
gaining 1
light 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
tendencies 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
parents 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
converse 1
is 1
equally 1
valid 1
i 1
have 1
frequently 1
gained 1
my 1
first 1
real 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
parents 1
by 1
studying 1
their 1
children 1
this 1
childs 1
disposition 1
is 1
abnormally 1
cruel 1
merely 1
for 1
crueltys 1
sake 1
and 1
whether 1
he 1
derives 1
this 1
from 1
his 1
smiling 1
father 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
suspect 1
or 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
it 1
bodes 1
evil 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
their 1
power 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
mr 1
holmes 1
cried 1
our 1
client 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
make 1
me 1
certain 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
hit 1
it 1
oh 1
let 1
us 1
lose 1
not 1
an 1
instant 1
in 1
bringing 1
help 1
to 1
this 1
poor 1
creature 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
circumspect 1
for 1
we 1
are 1
dealing 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
cunning 1
man 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
seven 1
oclock 1
at 1
that 1
hour 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
before 1
we 1
solve 1
the 1
mystery 1
we 1
were 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
seven 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
having 1
put 1
up 1
our 1
trap 1
at 1
a 1
wayside 1
publichouse 1
the 1
group 1
of 1
trees 1
with 1
their 1
dark 1
leaves 1
shining 1
like 1
burnished 1
metal 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
mark 1
the 1
house 1
even 1
had 1
miss 1
hunter 1
not 1
been 1
standing 1
smiling 1
on 1
the 1
doorstep 1
have 1
you 1
managed 1
it 1
asked 1
holmes 1
a 1
loud 1
thudding 1
noise 1
came 1
from 1
somewhere 1
downstairs 1
that 1
is 1
mrs 1
toller 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
said 1
she 1
her 1
husband 1
lies 1
snoring 1
on 1
the 1
kitchen 1
rug 1
here 1
are 1
his 1
keys 1
which 1
are 1
the 1
duplicates 1
of 1
mr 1
rucastles 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
well 1
indeed 1
cried 1
holmes 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
now 1
lead 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
black 1
business 1
we 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
stair 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
followed 1
on 1
down 1
a 1
passage 1
and 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
barricade 1
which 1
miss 1
hunter 1
had 1
described 1
holmes 1
cut 1
the 1
cord 1
and 1
removed 1
the 1
transverse 1
bar 1
then 1
he 1
tried 1
the 1
various 1
keys 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
no 1
sound 1
came 1
from 1
within 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
silence 1
holmes 1
face 1
clouded 1
over 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
late 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
think 1
miss 1
hunter 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
without 1
you 1
now 1
watson 1
put 1
your 1
shoulder 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whether 1
we 1
cannot 1
make 1
our 1
way 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
rickety 1
door 1
and 1
gave 1
at 1
once 1
before 1
our 1
united 1
strength 1
together 1
we 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
empty 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
furniture 1
save 1
a 1
little 1
pallet 1
bed 1
a 1
small 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
basketful 1
of 1
linen 1
the 1
skylight 1
above 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
prisoner 1
gone 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
some 1
villainy 1
here 1
said 1
holmes 1
this 1
beauty 1
has 1
guessed 1
miss 1
hunters 1
intentions 1
and 1
has 1
carried 1
his 1
victim 1
off 1
but 1
how 1
through 1
the 1
skylight 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
managed 1
it 1
he 1
swung 1
himself 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
roof 1
ah 1
yes 1
he 1
cried 1
heres 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
light 1
ladder 1
against 1
the 1
eaves 1
that 1
is 1
how 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
said 1
miss 1
hunter 1
the 1
ladder 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
when 1
the 1
rucastles 1
went 1
away 1
he 1
has 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
dangerous 1
man 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
surprised 1
if 1
this 1
were 1
he 1
whose 1
step 1
i 1
hear 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
your 1
pistol 1
ready 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
before 1
a 1
man 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
very 1
fat 1
and 1
burly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
miss 1
hunter 1
screamed 1
and 1
shrunk 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sprang 1
forward 1
and 1
confronted 1
him 1
you 1
villain 1
said 1
he 1
wheres 1
your 1
daughter 1
the 1
fat 1
man 1
cast 1
his 1
eyes 1
round 1
and 1
then 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
skylight 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
thieves 1
spies 1
and 1
thieves 1
i 1
have 1
caught 1
you 1
have 1
i 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
ill 1
serve 1
you 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
clattered 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
hes 1
gone 1
for 1
the 1
dog 1
cried 1
miss 1
hunter 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
revolver 1
said 1
i 1
better 1
close 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
cried 1
holmes 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
together 1
we 1
had 1
hardly 1
reached 1
the 1
hall 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
scream 1
of 1
agony 1
with 1
a 1
horrible 1
worrying 1
sound 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
an 1
elderly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
face 1
and 1
shaking 1
limbs 1
came 1
staggering 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
side 1
door 1
my 1
god 1
he 1
cried 1
someone 1
has 1
loosed 1
the 1
dog 1
its 1
not 1
been 1
fed 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
quick 1
quick 1
or 1
itll 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
toller 1
hurrying 1
behind 1
us 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
huge 1
famished 1
brute 1
its 1
black 1
muzzle 1
buried 1
in 1
rucastles 1
throat 1
while 1
he 1
writhed 1
and 1
screamed 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
running 1
up 1
i 1
blew 1
its 1
brains 1
out 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
with 1
its 1
keen 1
white 1
teeth 1
still 1
meeting 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
neck 1
with 1
much 1
labour 1
we 1
separated 1
them 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
living 1
but 1
horribly 1
mangled 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
we 1
laid 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
drawingroom 1
sofa 1
and 1
having 1
dispatched 1
the 1
sobered 1
toller 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
news 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
i 1
did 1
what 1
i 1
could 1
to 1
relieve 1
his 1
pain 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
assembled 1
round 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
gaunt 1
woman 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
mrs 1
toller 1
cried 1
miss 1
hunter 1
yes 1
miss 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
you 1
ah 1
miss 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
you 1
didnt 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
were 1
planning 1
for 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
pains 1
were 1
wasted 1
ha 1
said 1
holmes 1
looking 1
keenly 1
at 1
her 1
it 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
mrs 1
toller 1
knows 1
more 1
about 1
this 1
matter 1
than 1
anyone 1
else 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
do 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
ready 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
i 1
know 1
then 1
pray 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
it 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
points 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
id 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
before 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
ha 1
got 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
if 1
theres 1
policecourt 1
business 1
over 1
this 1
youll 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
stood 1
your 1
friend 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
miss 1
alices 1
friend 1
too 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
happy 1
at 1
home 1
miss 1
alice 1
wasnt 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
married 1
again 1
she 1
was 1
slighted 1
like 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
say 1
in 1
anything 1
but 1
it 1
never 1
really 1
became 1
bad 1
for 1
her 1
until 1
after 1
she 1
met 1
mr 1
fowler 1
at 1
a 1
friends 1
house 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
learn 1
miss 1
alice 1
had 1
rights 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
by 1
will 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
and 1
patient 1
she 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
them 1
but 1
just 1
left 1
everything 1
in 1
mr 1
rucastles 1
hands 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
a 1
husband 1
coming 1
forward 1
who 1
would 1
ask 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
then 1
her 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
time 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
stop 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
sign 1
a 1
paper 1
so 1
that 1
whether 1
she 1
married 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
could 1
use 1
her 1
money 1
when 1
she 1
wouldnt 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
kept 1
on 1
worrying 1
her 1
until 1
she 1
got 1
brainfever 1
and 1
for 1
six 1
weeks 1
was 1
at 1
deaths 1
door 1
then 1
she 1
got 1
better 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
worn 1
to 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
with 1
her 1
beautiful 1
hair 1
cut 1
off 1
but 1
that 1
didnt 1
make 1
no 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
stuck 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
man 1
could 1
be 1
ah 1
said 1
holmes 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
us 1
makes 1
the 1
matter 1
fairly 1
clear 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
deduce 1
all 1
that 1
remains 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
then 1
i 1
presume 1
took 1
to 1
this 1
system 1
of 1
imprisonment 1
yes 1
sir 1
and 1
brought 1
miss 1
hunter 1
down 1
from 1
london 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
disagreeable 1
persistence 1
of 1
mr 1
fowler 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
sir 1
but 1
mr 1
fowler 1
being 1
a 1
persevering 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
seaman 1
should 1
be 1
blockaded 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
having 1
met 1
you 1
succeeded 1
by 1
certain 1
arguments 1
metallic 1
or 1
otherwise 1
in 1
convincing 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
interests 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
his 1
mr 1
fowler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
kindspoken 1
freehanded 1
gentleman 1
said 1
mrs 1
toller 1
serenely 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
he 1
managed 1
that 1
your 1
good 1
man 1
should 1
have 1
no 1
want 1
of 1
drink 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
ladder 1
should 1
be 1
ready 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
your 1
master 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
you 1
have 1
it 1
sir 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
we 1
owe 1
you 1
an 1
apology 1
mrs 1
toller 1
said 1
holmes 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
certainly 1
cleared 1
up 1
everything 1
which 1
puzzled 1
us 1
and 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
country 1
surgeon 1
and 1
mrs 1
rucastle 1
so 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
best 1
escort 1
miss 1
hunter 1
back 1
to 1
winchester 1
as 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
our 1
locus 1
standi 1
now 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
questionable 1
one 1
and 1
thus 1
was 1
solved 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
sinister 1
house 1
with 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
mr 1
rucastle 1
survived 1
but 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
broken 1
man 1
kept 1
alive 1
solely 1
through 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
devoted 1
wife 1
they 1
still 1
live 1
with 1
their 1
old 1
servants 1
who 1
probably 1
know 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
rucastles 1
past 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
finds 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
part 1
from 1
them 1
mr 1
fowler 1
and 1
miss 1
rucastle 1
were 1
married 1
by 1
special 1
license 1
in 1
southampton 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
their 1
flight 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
holder 1
of 1
a 1
government 1
appointment 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
of 1
mauritius 1
as 1
to 1
miss 1
violet 1
hunter 1
my 1
friend 1
holmes 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
disappointment 1
manifested 1
no 1
further 1
interest 1
in 1
her 1
when 1
once 1
she 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
problems 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
private 1
school 1
at 1
walsall 1
where 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
met 1
