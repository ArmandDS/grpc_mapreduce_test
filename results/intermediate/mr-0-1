somewhat 1
bewildered 1
by 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
born 1
or 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
bred 1
in 1
a 1
handbag 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
handles 1
or 1
not 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
display 1
a 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
ordinary 1
decencies 1
of 1
family 1
life 1
that 1
reminds 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
excesses 1
of 1
the 1
french 1
revolution 1
and 1
i 1
presume 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
movement 1
led 1
to 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
particular 1
locality 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
handbag 1
was 1
found 1
a 1
cloakroom 1
at 1
a 1
railway 1
station 1
might 1
serve 1
to 1
conceal 1
a 1
social 1
indiscretionhas 1
probably 1
indeed 1
been 1
used 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
before 1
nowbut 1
it 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
an 1
assured 1
basis 1
for 1
a 1
recognised 1
position 1
in 1
good 1
society 1
jack 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
you 1
would 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
need 1
hardly 1
say 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
ensure 1
gwendolens 1
happiness 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
i 1
would 1
strongly 1
advise 1
you 1
mr 1
worthing 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
acquire 1
some 1
relations 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
definite 1
effort 1
to 1
produce 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
one 1
parent 1
of 1
either 1
sex 1
before 1
the 1
season 1
is 1
quite 1
over 1
jack 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
how 1
i 1
could 1
possibly 1
manage 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
produce 1
the 1
handbag 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
dressingroom 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
really 1
think 1
that 1
should 1
satisfy 1
you 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
me 1
sir 1
what 1
has 1
it 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
and 1
lord 1
bracknell 1
would 1
dream 1
of 1
allowing 1
our 1
only 1
daughtera 1
girl 1
brought 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
careto 1
marry 1
into 1
a 1
cloak 1
room 1
and 1
form 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
a 1
parcel 1
good 1
morning 1
mr 1
worthing 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
sweeps 1
out 1
in 1
majestic 1
indignation 1
jack 1
good 1
morning 1
algernon 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
strikes 1
up 1
the 1
wedding 1
march 1
jack 1
looks 1
perfectly 1
furious 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
dont 1
play 1
that 1
ghastly 1
tune 1
algy 1
how 1
idiotic 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
music 1
stops 1
and 1
algernon 1
enters 1
cheerily 1
algernon 1
didnt 1
it 1
go 1
off 1
all 1
right 1
old 1
boy 1
you 1
dont 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
gwendolen 1
refused 1
you 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
way 1
she 1
has 1
she 1
is 1
always 1
refusing 1
people 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
illnatured 1
of 1
her 1
jack 1
oh 1
gwendolen 1
is 1
as 1
right 1
as 1
a 1
trivet 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
she 1
is 1
concerned 1
we 1
are 1
engaged 1
her 1
mother 1
is 1
perfectly 1
unbearable 1
never 1
met 1
such 1
a 1
gorgon 1
i 1
dont 1
really 1
know 1
what 1
a 1
gorgon 1
is 1
like 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
is 1
one 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
monster 1
without 1
being 1
a 1
myth 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
unfair 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
algy 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
shouldnt 1
talk 1
about 1
your 1
own 1
aunt 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
before 1
you 1
algernon 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
i 1
love 1
hearing 1
my 1
relations 1
abused 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
relations 1
are 1
simply 1
a 1
tedious 1
pack 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
havent 1
got 1
the 1
remotest 1
knowledge 1
of 1
how 1
to 1
live 1
nor 1
the 1
smallest 1
instinct 1
about 1
when 1
to 1
die 1
jack 1
oh 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
algernon 1
it 1
isnt 1
jack 1
well 1
i 1
wont 1
argue 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
you 1
always 1
want 1
to 1
argue 1
about 1
things 1
algernon 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
things 1
were 1
originally 1
made 1
for 1
jack 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
id 1
shoot 1
myself 1
a 1
pause 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
chance 1
of 1
gwendolen 1
becoming 1
like 1
her 1
mother 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
years 1
do 1
you 1
algy 1
algernon 1
all 1
women 1
become 1
like 1
their 1
mothers 1

is 1
their 1
tragedy 1

man 1
does 1
thats 1
his 1
jack 1
is 1
that 1
clever 1
algernon 1

is 1
perfectly 1
phrased 1
and 1
quite 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
any 1
observation 1
in 1
civilised 1
life 1
should 1
be 1
jack 1
i 1
am 1
sick 1
to 1
death 1
of 1
cleverness 1
everybody 1
is 1
clever 1
nowadays 1
you 1
cant 1
go 1
anywhere 1
without 1
meeting 1
clever 1
people 1

thing 1

become 1
an 1
absolute 1
public 1
nuisance 1

had 1
a 1
few 1
fools 1

the 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1

nice 1
sweet 1
refined 1
girl 1

extraordinary 1
ideas 1
you 1
have 1
about 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
behave 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
algernon 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
behave 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
pretty 1
and 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
else 1

something 1
very 1
particular 1
to 1

really 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
allow 1
this 1
at 1
all 1
gwendolen 1
algy 1
you 1
always 1
adopt 1
a 1
strictly 1
immoral 1
attitude 1
towards 1
life 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
old 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
algernon 1
retires 1
to 1
the 1
fireplace 1
jack 1
my 1
own 1
darling 1
gwendolen 1
ernest 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
married 1
from 1
the 1
expression 1
on 1
mammas 1
face 1
i 1
fear 1
we 1
never 1
shall 1
few 1
parents 1
nowadays 1
pay 1
any 1
regard 1
to 1
what 1
their 1
children 1
say 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
oldfashioned 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
young 1
is 1
fast 1
dying 1
out 1
whatever 1
influence 1
i 1
ever 1
had 1
over 1
mamma 1
i 1
lost 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
three 1
but 1
although 1
she 1
may 1
prevent 1
us 1
from 1
becoming 1
man 1
and 1
wife 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
marry 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
and 1
marry 1
often 1
nothing 1
that 1
she 1
can 1
possibly 1
do 1
can 1
alter 1
my 1
eternal 1
devotion 1
to 1
you 1
jack 1
dear 1
gwendolen 1
gwendolen 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
your 1
romantic 1
origin 1
as 1
related 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
mamma 1
with 1
unpleasing 1
comments 1
has 1
naturally 1
stirred 1
the 1
deeper 1
fibres 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
your 1
christian 1
name 1
has 1
an 1
irresistible 1
fascination 1
the 1
simplicity 1
of 1
your 1
character 1
makes 1
you 1
exquisitely 1
incomprehensible 1
to 1
me 1
your 1
town 1
address 1
at 1
the 1
albany 1
i 1
have 1
what 1
is 1

country 1

the 1
manor 1

woolton 1
hertfordshire 1
algernon 1

has 1
been 1
carefully 1
listening 1

to 1
himself 1
and 1
writes 1
the 1
address 1

his 1
shirtcuff 1

up 1
the 1
railway 1
guide 1
gwendolen 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
postal 1
service 1
i 1
suppose 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
desperate 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
will 1
require 1
serious 1
consideration 1
i 1
will 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
daily 1
jack 1

cecily 1
surely 1
such 1
a 1
utilitarian 1
occupation 1
as 1
the 1
watering 1
of 1

is 1
rather 1
moultons 1
duty 1
than 1
yours 1

at 1
a 1

intellectual 1

await 1

we 1
will 1
repeat 1
yesterdays 1
lesson 1
cecily 1
coming 1
over 1
very 1
slowly 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
german 1
it 1
isnt 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
becoming 1
language 1
i 1
know 1
perfectly 1
well 1
that 1
i 1
look 1
quite 1
plain 1
after 1
my 1
german 1
lesson 1
miss 1
prism 1
child 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
anxious 1
your 1
guardian 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
improve 1
yourself 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
he 1
laid 1
particular 1
stress 1
on 1
your 1
german 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
leaving 1
for 1
town 1
yesterday 1
indeed 1
he 1
always 1
lays 1
stress 1
on 1
your 1
german 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
leaving 1
for 1
town 1
cecily 1
dear 1
uncle 1
jack 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
serious 1
sometimes 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
serious 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
cannot 1
be 1
quite 1
well 1
miss 1
prism 1
drawing 1
herself 1
up 1
your 1
guardian 1
enjoys 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
his 1
gravity 1
of 1
demeanour 1
is 1
especially 1
to 1
be 1
commended 1
in 1
one 1
so 1
comparatively 1
young 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
i 1
know 1
no 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
higher 1
sense 1
of 1
duty 1
and 1
responsibility 1
cecily 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
he 1
often 1
looks 1
a 1
little 1
bored 1
when 1
we 1
three 1
are 1
together 1
miss 1
prism 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
surprised 1
at 1
you 1
mr 1
worthing 1
has 1
many 1
troubles 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
idle 1
merriment 1
and 1
triviality 1
would 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
in 1
his 1
conversation 1
you 1
must 1
remember 1
his 1
constant 1
anxiety 1
about 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
cecily 1
i 1
wish 1
uncle 1
jack 1
would 1
allow 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
sometimes 1
we 1
might 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
miss 1
prism 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
certainly 1
would 1
you 1
know 1
german 1
and 1
geology 1
and 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
influence 1
a 1
man 1
very 1
much 1
cecily 1
begins 1
to 1
write 1
in 1
her 1
diary 1
miss 1
prism 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
even 1
i 1
could 1
produce 1
any 1
effect 1
on 1
a 1
character 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
brothers 1
admission 1
is 1
irretrievably 1
weak 1
and 1
vacillating 1
indeed 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
desire 1
to 1
reclaim 1
him 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
this 1
modern 1
mania 1
for 1
turning 1
bad 1
people 1
into 1
good 1
people 1
at 1
a 1
moments 1
notice 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
sows 1
so 1
let 1
him 1
reap 1
you 1
must 1
put 1
away 1
your 1
diary 1
cecily 1
i 1
really 1
dont 1
see 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
at 1
all 1
cecily 1
i 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
wonderful 1
secrets 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
write 1
them 1
down 1
i 1
should 1
probably 1
forget 1
all 1
about 1
them 1
miss 1
prism 1
memory 1
my 1
dear 1
cecily 1
is 1
the 1
diary 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
carry 1
about 1
with 1
us 1
cecily 1
yes 1
but 1
it 1
usually 1
chronicles 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
have 1
never 1
happened 1
and 1
couldnt 1
possibly 1
have 1
happened 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
memory 1
is 1
responsible 1
for 1
nearly 1
all 1
the 1
threevolume 1
novels 1
that 1
mudie 1
sends 1
us 1
miss 1
prism 1
do 1
not 1
speak 1
slightingly 1
of 1
the 1
threevolume 1
novel 1
cecily 1
i 1
wrote 1
one 1
myself 1
in 1
earlier 1
days 1
cecily 1
did 1
you 1
really 1
miss 1
prism 1
how 1
wonderfully 1
clever 1
you 1
are 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
end 1
happily 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
novels 1
that 1
end 1
happily 1
they 1
depress 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
miss 1
prism 1
the 1
good 1
ended 1
happily 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
unhappily 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
fiction 1
means 1
cecily 1
i 1
suppose 1
so 1
but 1
it 1
seems 1
very 1
unfair 1
and 1
was 1
your 1
novel 1
ever 1
published 1
miss 1
prism 1
alas 1
no 1
the 1
manuscript 1
unfortunately 1
was 1
abandoned 1
cecily 1
starts 1
i 1
use 1
the 1
word 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
lost 1
or 1
mislaid 1
to 1
your 1
work 1
child 1
these 1
speculations 1
are 1
profitless 1
cecily 1
smiling 1
but 1
i 1
see 1
dear 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
coming 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
garden 1
miss 1
prism 1
rising 1
and 1
advancing 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
this 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
pleasure 1
enter 1
canon 1
chasuble 1
chasuble 1
and 1
how 1
are 1
we 1
this 1
morning 1
miss 1
prism 1
you 1
are 1
i 1
trust 1
well 1
cecily 1
miss 1
prism 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
complaining 1
of 1
a 1
slight 1
headache 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
good 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
short 1
stroll 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
miss 1
prism 1
cecily 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
mentioned 1
anything 1
about 1
a 1
headache 1
cecily 1
no 1
dear 1
miss 1
prism 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
instinctively 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
headache 1
indeed 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
about 1
that 1
and 1
not 1
about 1
my 1
german 1
lesson 1
when 1
the 1
rector 1
came 1
in 1
chasuble 1
i 1
hope 1
cecily 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
inattentive 1
cecily 1
oh 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
am 1
chasuble 1
that 1
is 1
strange 1
were 1
i 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
miss 1
prisms 1
pupil 1
i 1
would 1
hang 1
upon 1
her 1
lips 1
miss 1
prism 1
glares 1
i 1
spoke 1
metaphoricallymy 1
metaphor 1
was 1
drawn 1
from 1
bees 1
ahem 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
suppose 1
has 1
not 1
returned 1
from 1
town 1
yet 1
miss 1
prism 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
expect 1
him 1
till 1
monday 1
afternoon 1
chasuble 1
ah 1
yes 1
he 1
usually 1
likes 1
to 1
spend 1
his 1
sunday 1
in 1
london 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
sole 1
aim 1
is 1
enjoyment 1
as 1
by 1
all 1
accounts 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
disturb 1
egeria 1
and 1
her 1
pupil 1
any 1
longer 1

you 1
both 1
no 1
doubt 1
at 1
evensong 1

think 1
dear 1
doctor 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
stroll 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
find 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
headache 1
after 1
all 1
and 1
a 1
walk 1
might 1
do 1
it 1
good 1
chasuble 1
with 1
pleasure 1
miss 1
prism 1
with 1
pleasure 1
we 1
might 1
go 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
schools 1
and 1
back 1
miss 1
prism 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
delightful 1
cecily 1
you 1

the 1

may 1
omit 1
it 1

somewhat 1
too 1
sensational 1
even 1
these 1
metallic 1
problems 1
have 1
their 1
melodramatic 1
side 1
goes 1
down 1

mentioned 1

you 1

in 1

anxious 1

to 1
you 1
privately 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
cecily 1
ask 1
mr 1
ernest 1

to 1
come 1

better 1
talk 1
to 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
about 1
a 1
room 1
for 1
him 1
merriman 1
yes 1

off 1
cecily 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
any 1
really 1
wicked 1
person 1
before 1
i 1
feel 1
rather 1
frightened 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
afraid 1
he 1
will 1
look 1
just 1
like 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
enter 1
algernon 1
very 1
gay 1
and 1
debonnair 1
he 1
does 1
algernon 1
raising 1
his 1
hat 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
little 1
cousin 1
cecily 1
im 1
sure 1
cecily 1
you 1
are 1
under 1
some 1
strange 1
mistake 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
little 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
am 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
tall 1
for 1
my 1
age 1
algernon 1
is 1
rather 1
taken 1
aback 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
cousin 1
cecily 1
you 1
i 1
see 1
from 1
your 1
card 1
are 1
uncle 1
jacks 1
brother 1
my 1
cousin 1
ernest 1
my 1
wicked 1
cousin 1
ernest 1
algernon 1
oh 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
really 1
wicked 1
at 1
all 1
cousin 1
cecily 1
you 1
mustnt 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
wicked 1
cecily 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
then 1
you 1
have 1
certainly 1
been 1
deceiving 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
inexcusable 1
manner 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
leading 1
a 1
double 1
life 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
wicked 1
and 1
being 1
really 1
good 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
hypocrisy 1
algernon 1
looks 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
oh 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
rather 1
reckless 1
cecily 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
algernon 1
in 1
fact 1
now 1
you 1
mention 1
the 1
subject 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
bad 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
small 1
way 1
cecily 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
proud 1
of 1
that 1
though 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
pleasant 1
algernon 1
it 1
is 1
much 1
pleasanter 1
being 1
here 1
with 1
you 1
cecily 1
i 1
cant 1
understand 1
how 1
you 1
are 1
here 1
at 1
all 1
uncle 1
jack 1
wont 1
be 1
back 1
till 1
monday 1
afternoon 1
algernon 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
disappointment 1
i 1
am 1
obliged 1
to 1
go 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
train 1
on 1
monday 1
morning 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
business 1
appointment 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
anxious 1
to 1
miss 1
cecily 1
couldnt 1
you 1
miss 1
it 1
anywhere 1
but 1
in 1
london 1
algernon 1
no 1
the 1
appointment 1
is 1
in 1
london 1
cecily 1
well 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
course 1
how 1
important 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
business 1
engagement 1
if 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
retain 1
any 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
wait 1
till 1
uncle 1
jack 1
arrives 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
your 1
emigrating 1
algernon 1
about 1
my 1
what 1
cecily 1
your 1
emigrating 1
he 1
has 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
buy 1

i 1
am 1
hungry 1
cecily 1
how 1
thoughtless 1
of 1

going 1
to 1
lead 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
life 1

pink 1
rose 1
cousin 1

cecily 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1

can 1
be 1
right 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
miss 1
prism 1
never 1
says 1
such 1
things 1
to 1
me 1
algernon 1
then 1
miss 1
prism 1
is 1
a 1
shortsighted 1
old 1
lady 1
cecily 1
puts 1
the 1
rose 1
in 1
his 1
buttonhole 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
prettiest 1
girl 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
cecily 1
miss 1
prism 1
says 1
that 1
all 1
good 1
looks 1
are 1
a 1
snare 1
algernon 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
snare 1
that 1
every 1
sensible 1
man 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
caught 1
in 1
cecily 1
oh 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
would 1
care 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
sensible 1
man 1
i 1
shouldnt 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
him 1
about 1
they 1
pass 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
miss 1
prism 1
and 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
return 1
miss 1
prism 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
much 1
alone 1
dear 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
you 1
should 1
get 1
married 1
a 1
misanthrope 1
i 1
can 1
understanda 1
womanthrope 1
never 1
chasuble 1
with 1
a 1
scholars 1
shudder 1
believe 1
me 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
deserve 1
so 1
neologistic 1
a 1
phrase 1
the 1
precept 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
practice 1
of 1
the 1
primitive 1
church 1
was 1
distinctly 1
against 1
matrimony 1
miss 1
prism 1
sententiously 1
that 1
is 1
obviously 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
the 1
primitive 1
church 1
has 1
not 1
lasted 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
and 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
realise 1
dear 1
doctor 1
that 1
by 1
persistently 1
remaining 1
single 1
a 1
man 1
converts 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
permanent 1
public 1
temptation 1
men 1
should 1
be 1
more 1
careful 1
this 1
very 1
celibacy 1
leads 1
weaker 1
vessels 1
astray 1
chasuble 1
but 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
not 1
equally 1
attractive 1
when 1
married 1
miss 1
prism 1
no 1
married 1
man 1
is 1
ever 1
attractive 1
except 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
chasuble 1
and 1
often 1
ive 1
been 1
told 1
not 1
even 1
to 1
her 1
miss 1
prism 1
that 1
depends 1
on 1
the 1
intellectual 1
sympathies 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1

always 1
be 1

spoke 1
horticulturally 1
my 1
metaphor 1
was 1
drawn 1
from 1
fruits 1

where 1

a 1
surprise 1

for 1
you 1
till 1
monday 1
afternoon 1
jack 1

a 1
tragic 1
manner 1

returned 1

are 1
well 1
chasuble 1
dear 1
mr 1
worthing 1

trust 1
this 1
garb 1

terrible 1
calamity 1

shameful 1

a 1
lesson 1
for 1
him 1

trust 1
he 1
will 1
profit 1
by 1
it 1
chasuble 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
offer 1
you 1
my 1
sincere 1
condolence 1
you 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
consolation 1
of 1
knowing 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
always 1
the 1
most 1
generous 1
and 1
forgiving 1
of 1
brothers 1
jack 1
poor 1
ernest 1
he 1
had 1
many 1
faults 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sad 1
sad 1
blow 1
chasuble 1
very 1
sad 1
indeed 1
were 1
you 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
jack 1
no 1
he 1
died 1
abroad 1
in 1
paris 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
telegram 1
last 1
night 1
from 1
the 1
manager 1
of 1
the 1
grand 1
hotel 1
chasuble 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
death 1
mentioned 1
jack 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
it 1
seems 1
miss 1
prism 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
sows 1
so 1
shall 1
he 1
reap 1
chasuble 1
raising 1
his 1

none 1
of 1
us 1
are 1
perfect 1
i 1
myself 1
am 1
peculiarly 1
susceptible 1
to 1
draughts 1
will 1
the 1
interment 1
take 1
place 1
here 1
jack 1

he 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
buried 1
in 1
paris 1
chasuble 1
in 1
paris 1
shakes 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
hardly 1
points 1
to 1
any 1
very 1
serious 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
you 1
would 1
no 1
doubt 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
slight 1
allusion 1
to 1
this 1
tragic 1
domestic 1
affliction 1
next 1
sunday 1
jack 1
presses 1
his 1
hand 1
convulsively 1
my 1
sermon 1
on 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
the 1
manna 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness 1
can 1
be 1
adapted 1
to 1
almost 1
any 1
occasion 1
joyful 1
or 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
distressing 1
all 1
sigh 1
i 1
have 1
preached 1
it 1
at 1
harvest 1
celebrations 1
christenings 1
confirmations 1
on 1
days 1
of 1
humiliation 1
and 1
festal 1
days 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
i 1
delivered 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
cathedral 1
as 1
a 1
charity 1
sermon 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
for 1
the 1
prevention 1
of 1
discontent 1
among 1
the 1
upper 1
orders 1
the 1
bishop 1
who 1
was 1
present 1
was 1
much 1
struck 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
analogies 1
i 1
drew 1
jack 1
ah 1
that 1
reminds 1
me 1
you 1
mentioned 1
christenings 1
i 1
think 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
christen 1
all 1
right 1
dr 1
chasuble 1
looks 1
astounded 1
i 1
mean 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
are 1
continually 1
christening 1
arent 1
you 1
miss 1
prism 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
regret 1
to 1
say 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rectors 1
most 1
constant 1
duties 1
in 1
this 1
parish 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
spoken 1
to 1
the 1
poorer 1
classes 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
they 1
dont 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
thrift 1
is 1
chasuble 1
but 1
is 1
there 1
any 1
particular 1
infant 1
in 1
whom 1
you 1
are 1
interested 1
mr 1
worthing 1
your 1
brother 1
was 1
i 1
believe 1
unmarried 1
was 1
he 1
not 1
jack 1
oh 1
yes 1
miss 1
prism 1
bitterly 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
entirely 1
for 1
pleasure 1
usually 1
are 1
jack 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
for 1
any 1
child 1
dear 1
doctor 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
children 1
no 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
myself 1
this 1
afternoon 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
nothing 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
chasuble 1
but 1
surely 1
mr 1
worthing 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
jack 1
i 1
dont 1
remember 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
chasuble 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
grave 1
doubts 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
jack 1
i 1
certainly 1
intend 1
to 1
have 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
if 1
the 1
thing 1
would 1
bother 1
you 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
or 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
old 1
now 1
chasuble 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
sprinkling 1
and 1
indeed 1
the 1
immersion 1
of 1
adults 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
canonical 1
practice 1
jack 1
immersion 1
chasuble 1
you 1
need 1
have 1
no 1
apprehensions 1
sprinkling 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
necessary 1
or 1
indeed 1
i 1
think 1
advisable 1
our 1
weather 1
is 1
so 1
changeable 1
at 1
what 1
hour 1
would 1
you 1
wish 1
the 1
ceremony 1
performed 1
jack 1
oh 1
i 1
might 1
trot 1
round 1
about 1
five 1
if 1
that 1
would 1
suit 1
you 1
chasuble 1
perfectly 1
perfectly 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
have 1
two 1
similar 1
ceremonies 1
to 1
perform 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
twins 1
that 1
occurred 1
recently 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
outlying 1
cottages 1
on 1
your 1
own 1
estate 1
poor 1
jenkins 1
the 1
carter 1
a 1
most 1
hardworking 1
man 1
jack 1
oh 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
much 1
fun 1
in 1
being 1
christened 1
along 1
with 1
other 1
babies 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
childish 1
would 1
halfpast 1
five 1
do 1
chasuble 1
admirably 1
admirably 1
takes 1
out 1
watch 1
and 1
now 1
dear 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
intrude 1
any 1
longer 1
into 1
a 1
house 1
of 1
sorrow 1
i 1
would 1
merely 1
beg 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
bowed 1
down 1
by 1
grief 1
what 1
seem 1
to 1
us 1
bitter 1
trials 1
are 1
often 1
blessings 1
in 1
disguise 1
miss 1

to 1
me 1
a 1
blessing 1
of 1
an 1
extremely 1
obvious 1
kind 1

his 1
loss 1

sudden 1

the 1
diningroom 1

is 1
some 1
good 1
in 1
every 1
one 1
ernest 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
telling 1
me 1
about 1
his 1
poor 1
invalid 1
friend 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
whom 1
he 1
goes 1
to 1
visit 1
so 1
often 1
and 1
surely 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
much 1
good 1
in 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
kind 1
to 1
an 1
invalid 1
and 1
leaves 1
the 1
pleasures 1
of 1
london 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
pain 1
jack 1

been 1
talking 1
about 1
bunbury 1

told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
poor 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
and 1
his 1
terrible 1
state 1
of 1
health 1
jack 1
bunbury 1
well 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
him 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
bunbury 1
or 1
about 1
anything 1
else 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
drive 1
one 1
perfectly 1
frantic 1
algernon 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
faults 1
were 1
all 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
brother 1
johns 1
coldness 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
peculiarly 1
painful 1
i 1
expected 1
a 1
more 1
enthusiastic 1
welcome 1
especially 1
considering 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
here 1
cecily 1
uncle 1
jack 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
ernest 1

will 1
never 1
forgive 1

shakes 1
with 1
algernon 1
and 1
glares 1
chasuble 1
its 1
pleasant 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
so 1
perfect 1
a 1
reconciliation 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
might 1
leave 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
together 1
miss 1
prism 1
cecily 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
with 1

little 1
task 1
of 1
reconciliation 1
is 1
over 1
chasuble 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
beautiful 1
action 1
today 1
dear 1
child 1
miss 1
prism 1
we 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
premature 1
in 1
our 1
judgments 1
cecily 1

feel 1
very 1
happy 1

duty 1
as 1
a 1
gentleman 1
calls 1
you 1
back 1
algernon 1
my 1
duty 1
as 1
a 1
gentleman 1
has 1
never 1
interfered 1
with 1
my 1
pleasures 1
in 1
the 1
smallest 1
degree 1
jack 1
i 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
that 1
algernon 1
well 1
cecily 1
is 1
a 1
darling 1
jack 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
miss 1
cardew 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
it 1
algernon 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
your 1
clothes 1
you 1
look 1
perfectly 1
ridiculous 1
in 1
them 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
dont 1
you 1
go 1
up 1
and 1
change 1
it 1
is 1
perfectly 1
childish 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
deep 1
mourning 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
actually 1
staying 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
week 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
house 1
as 1
a 1
guest 1
i 1
call 1
it 1
grotesque 1
jack 1
you 1
are 1
certainly 1
not 1
staying 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
week 1
as 1
a 1
guest 1
or 1
anything 1
else 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
leave 1
by 1
the 1
fourfive 1
train 1
algernon 1
i 1
certainly 1
wont 1
leave 1
you 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
mourning 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
unfriendly 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
in 1
mourning 1
you 1
would 1
stay 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
very 1
unkind 1
if 1
you 1
didnt 1
jack 1
well 1
will 1
you 1
go 1
if 1
i 1
change 1
my 1
clothes 1
algernon 1
yes 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
long 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
anybody 1
take 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
dress 1
and 1
with 1
such 1
little 1
result 1
jack 1
well 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
that 1
is 1
better 1
than 1
being 1
always 1
overdressed 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
algernon 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
occasionally 1
a 1
little 1
overdressed 1
i 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
it 1
by 1
being 1
always 1
immensely 1
overeducated 1
jack 1
your 1
vanity 1
is 1
ridiculous 1
your 1
conduct 1
an 1
outrage 1
and 1
your 1
presence 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
utterly 1
absurd 1
however 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
fourfive 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
pleasant 1
journey 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
this 1
bunburying 1
as 1
you 1
call 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
for 1
you 1
goes 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
will 1
find 1
little 1
credit 1
to 1
be 1
gained 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
case 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
deceptive 1
than 1
an 1
obvious 1
fact 1
he 1
answered 1
laughing 1
besides 1
we 1
may 1
chance 1
to 1
hit 1
upon 1
some 1
other 1
obvious 1
facts 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
obvious 1
to 1
mr 1
lestrade 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
too 1
well 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
boasting 1
when 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
either 1
confirm 1
or 1
destroy 1
his 1
theory 1
by 1
means 1
which 1
he 1
is 1
quite 1
incapable 1
of 1
employing 1
or 1
even 1
of 1
understanding 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
first 1
example 1
to 1
hand 1
i 1
very 1
clearly 1
perceive 1
that 1
in 1
your 1
bedroom 1
the 1
window 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
righthand 1
side 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
question 1
whether 1
mr 1
lestrade 1
would 1
have 1
noted 1
even 1
so 1
selfevident 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
well 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
military 1
neatness 1
which 1
characterises 1
you 1
you 1
shave 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
season 1
you 1
shave 1
by 1
the 1
sunlight 1
but 1
since 1
your 1
shaving 1
is 1
less 1
and 1
less 1
complete 1
as 1
we 1
get 1
farther 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
until 1
it 1
becomes 1
positively 1
slovenly 1
as 1
we 1
get 1
round 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
jaw 1
it 1
is 1
surely 1
very 1
clear 1
that 1
that 1
side 1
is 1
less 1
illuminated 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
your 1
habits 1
looking 1
at 1
himself 1
in 1
an 1
equal 1
light 1
and 1
being 1
satisfied 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
result 1
i 1
only 1
quote 1
this 1
as 1
a 1
trivial 1
example 1
of 1
observation 1
and 1
inference 1
therein 1
lies 1
my 1
metier 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
service 1
in 1
the 1
investigation 1
which 1
lies 1
before 1
us 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
minor 1
points 1
which 1
were 1
brought 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
inquest 1
and 1
which 1
are 1
worth 1
considering 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
it 1
appears 1
that 1
his 1
arrest 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
place 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
after 1
the 1
return 1
to 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
on 1
the 1
inspector 1
of 1
constabulary 1
informing 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
he 1
remarked 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
surprised 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
his 1
deserts 1
this 1
observation 1
of 1
his 1
had 1
the 1
natural 1
effect 1
of 1
removing 1
any 1
traces 1
of 1
doubt 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
coroners 1
jury 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
confession 1
i 1
ejaculated 1
no 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
protestation 1
of 1
innocence 1
coming 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
damning 1
series 1
of 1
events 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
most 1
suspicious 1
remark 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
brightest 1
rift 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
at 1
present 1
see 1
in 1
the 1
clouds 1
however 1
innocent 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
such 1
an 1
absolute 1
imbecile 1
as 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
circumstances 1
were 1
very 1
black 1
against 1
him 1
had 1
he 1
appeared 1
surprised 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
arrest 1
or 1
feigned 1
indignation 1
at 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
highly 1
suspicious 1
because 1
such 1
surprise 1
or 1
anger 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
natural 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
and 1
yet 1
might 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
policy 1
to 1
a 1
scheming 1
man 1
his 1
frank 1
acceptance 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
marks 1
him 1
as 1
either 1
an 1
innocent 1
man 1
or 1
else 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
considerable 1
selfrestraint 1
and 1
firmness 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
remark 1
about 1
his 1
deserts 1
it 1
was 1
also 1
not 1
unnatural 1
if 1
you 1
consider 1
that 1
he 1
stood 1
beside 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
so 1
far 1
forgotten 1
his 1
filial 1
duty 1
as 1
to 1
bandy 1
words 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
even 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
whose 1
evidence 1
is 1
so 1
important 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
strike 1
him 1
the 1
selfreproach 1
and 1
contrition 1
which 1
are 1
displayed 1
in 1
his 1
remark 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
a 1
healthy 1
mind 1
rather 1
than 1
of 1
a 1
guilty 1
one 1
i 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
many 1
men 1
have 1
been 1
hanged 1
on 1
far 1
slighter 1
evidence 1
i 1
remarked 1
so 1
they 1
have 1
and 1
many 1
men 1
have 1
been 1
wrongfully 1
hanged 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
young 1
mans 1
own 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
not 1
very 1
encouraging 1
to 1
his 1
supporters 1
though 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
points 1
in 1
it 1
which 1
are 1
suggestive 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
may 1
read 1
it 1
for 1
yourself 1
he 1
picked 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
bundle 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
the 1
local 1
herefordshire 1
paper 1
and 1
having 1
turned 1
down 1
the 1
sheet 1
he 1
pointed 1
out 1
the 1
paragraph 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
own 1
statement 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
i 1
settled 1
myself 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
very 1
carefully 1
it 1
ran 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
mr 1
james 1
mccarthy 1
the 1
only 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
was 1
then 1
called 1
and 1
gave 1
evidence 1
as 1
follows 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
at 1
bristol 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
just 1
returned 1
upon 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
last 1
monday 1
the 1
3rd 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
absent 1
from 1
home 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
arrival 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
informed 1
by 1
the 1
maid 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
driven 1
over 1
to 1
ross 1
with 1
john 1
cobb 1
the 1
groom 1
shortly 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
his 1
trap 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
window 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
get 1
out 1
and 1
walk 1
rapidly 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
yard 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
in 1
which 1
direction 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
i 1
then 1
took 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
strolled 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
visiting 1
the 1
rabbit 1
warren 1
which 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
i 1
saw 1
william 1
crowder 1
the 1
gamekeeper 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
stated 1
in 1
his 1
evidence 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
mistaken 1
in 1
thinking 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
following 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
when 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
pool 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
cooee 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
usual 1
signal 1
between 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
myself 1
i 1
then 1
hurried 1
forward 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
pool 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
much 1
surprised 1
at 1
seeing 1
me 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
rather 1
roughly 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
there 1
a 1
conversation 1
ensued 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
high 1
words 1
and 1
almost 1
to 1
blows 1
for 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
violent 1
temper 1
seeing 1
that 1
his 1
passion 1
was 1
becoming 1
ungovernable 1
i 1
left 1
him 1
and 1
returned 1
towards 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
more 1
than 1
150 1
yards 1
however 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
hideous 1
outcry 1
behind 1
me 1
which 1
caused 1
me 1
to 1
run 1
back 1
again 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
father 1
expiring 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
terribly 1
injured 1
i 1
dropped 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
but 1
he 1
almost 1
instantly 1
expired 1
i 1
knelt 1
beside 1
him 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
mr 1
turners 1
lodgekeeper 1
his 1
house 1
being 1
the 1
nearest 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
assistance 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
near 1
my 1
father 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
how 1
he 1
came 1
by 1
his 1
injuries 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
popular 1
man 1
being 1
somewhat 1
cold 1
and 1
forbidding 1
in 1
his 1
manners 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
know 1
no 1
active 1
enemies 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
further 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
coroner 1
did 1
your 1
father 1
make 1
any 1
statement 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
he 1
died 1
witness 1
he 1
mumbled 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
catch 1
some 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
the 1
coroner 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
understand 1
by 1
that 1
witness 1
it 1
conveyed 1
no 1
meaning 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
delirious 1
the 1
coroner 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
point 1
upon 1
which 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
had 1
this 1
final 1
quarrel 1
witness 1
i 1
should 1
prefer 1
not 1
to 1
answer 1
the 1
coroner 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
press 1
it 1
witness 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
i 1
can 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
sad 1
tragedy 1
which 1
followed 1
the 1
coroner 1
that 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
court 1
to 1
decide 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
point 1
out 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
refusal 1
to 1
answer 1
will 1
prejudice 1
your 1
case 1
considerably 1
in 1
any 1
future 1
proceedings 1
which 1
may 1
arise 1
witness 1
i 1
must 1
still 1
refuse 1
the 1
coroner 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
cooee 1
was 1
a 1
common 1
signal 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
witness 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
coroner 1
how 1
was 1
it 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
uttered 1
it 1
before 1
he 1
saw 1
you 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
even 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
returned 1
from 1
bristol 1
witness 1
with 1
considerable 1
confusion 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
a 1
juryman 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
nothing 1
which 1
aroused 1
your 1
suspicions 1
when 1
you 1
returned 1
on 1
hearing 1
the 1
cry 1
and 1
found 1
your 1
father 1
fatally 1
injured 1
witness 1
nothing 1
definite 1
the 1
coroner 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
witness 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
disturbed 1
and 1
excited 1
as 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
except 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
yet 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
vague 1
impression 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
ran 1
forward 1
something 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
me 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
grey 1
in 1
colour 1
a 1
coat 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
or 1
a 1
plaid 1
perhaps 1
when 1
i 1
rose 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
looked 1
round 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
it 1
disappeared 1
before 1
you 1
went 1
for 1
help 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
you 1
cannot 1
say 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
feeling 1
something 1
was 1
there 1
how 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
body 1
a 1
dozen 1
yards 1
or 1
so 1
and 1
how 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
then 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
removed 1
it 1
was 1
while 1
you 1
were 1
within 1
a 1
dozen 1
yards 1
of 1
it 1
yes 1
but 1
with 1
my 1
back 1
towards 1
it 1
this 1
concluded 1
the 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
witness 1
i 1
see 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
i 1
glanced 1
down 1
the 1
column 1
that 1
the 1
coroner 1
in 1
his 1
concluding 1
remarks 1
was 1
rather 1
severe 1
upon 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
he 1
calls 1
attention 1
and 1
with 1
reason 1
to 1
the 1
discrepancy 1
about 1
his 1
father 1
having 1
signalled 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
seeing 1
him 1
also 1
to 1
his 1
refusal 1
to 1
give 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
conversation 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
singular 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
fathers 1
dying 1
words 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
as 1
he 1
remarks 1
very 1
much 1
against 1
the 1
son 1
holmes 1
laughed 1
softly 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
cushioned 1
seat 1
both 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
coroner 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
some 1
pains 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
single 1
out 1
the 1
very 1
strongest 1
points 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
mans 1
favour 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
alternately 1
give 1
him 1
credit 1
for 1
having 1
too 1
much 1
imagination 1
and 1
too 1
little 1
too 1
little 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
invent 1
a 1
cause 1
of 1
quarrel 1
which 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
the 1
jury 1
too 1
much 1
if 1
he 1
evolved 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
inner 1
consciousness 1
anything 1
so 1
outre 1
as 1
a 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
vanishing 1
cloth 1
no 1
sir 1
i 1
shall 1
approach 1
this 1
case 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
that 1
what 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
says 1
is 1
true 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whither 1
that 1
hypothesis 1
will 1
lead 1
us 1
and 1
now 1
here 1
is 1
my 1
pocket 1
petrarch 1
and 1
not 1
another 1
word 1
shall 1
i 1
say 1
of 1
this 1
case 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
we 1
lunch 1
at 1
swindon 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
four 1
oclock 1
when 1
we 1
at 1
last 1
after 1
passing 1
through 1
the 1
beautiful 1
stroud 1
valley 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
broad 1
gleaming 1
severn 1
found 1
ourselves 1
at 1
the 1
pretty 1
little 1
countrytown 1
of 1
ross 1
a 1
lean 1
ferretlike 1
man 1
furtive 1
and 1
slylooking 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
platform 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
light 1
brown 1
dustcoat 1
and 1
leatherleggings 1
which 1
he 1
wore 1
in 1
deference 1
to 1
his 1
rustic 1
surroundings 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
recognising 1
lestrade 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
with 1
him 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
the 1
hereford 1
arms 1
where 1
a 1
room 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
engaged 1
for 1
us 1
i 1
have 1
ordered 1
a 1
carriage 1
said 1
lestrade 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
over 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
i 1
knew 1
your 1
energetic 1
nature 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
happy 1
until 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
complimentary 1
of 1
you 1
holmes 1
answered 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
barometric 1
pressure 1
lestrade 1
looked 1
startled 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
quite 1
follow 1
he 1
said 1
how 1
is 1
the 1
glass 1
twentynine 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
wind 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
cloud 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
caseful 1
of 1
cigarettes 1
here 1
which 1
need 1
smoking 1
and 1
the 1
sofa 1
is 1
very 1
much 1
superior 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
country 1
hotel 1
abomination 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
use 1
the 1
carriage 1
tonight 1
lestrade 1
laughed 1
indulgently 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
already 1
formed 1
your 1
conclusions 1
from 1
the 1
newspapers 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
case 1
is 1
as 1
plain 1
as 1
a 1
pikestaff 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
one 1
goes 1
into 1
it 1
the 1
plainer 1
it 1
becomes 1
still 1
of 1
course 1
one 1
cant 1
refuse 1
a 1
lady 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
positive 1
one 1
too 1
she 1
has 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
your 1
opinion 1
though 1
i 1
repeatedly 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
which 1
you 1
could 1
do 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
already 1
done 1
why 1
bless 1
my 1
soul 1
here 1
is 1
her 1
carriage 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
had 1
hardly 1
spoken 1
before 1
there 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
lovely 1
young 1
women 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
her 1
violet 1
eyes 1
shining 1
her 1
lips 1
parted 1
a 1
pink 1
flush 1
upon 1
her 1
cheeks 1
all 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
natural 1
reserve 1
lost 1
in 1
her 1
overpowering 1
excitement 1
and 1
concern 1
oh 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
she 1
cried 1
glancing 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
finally 1
with 1
a 1
womans 1
quick 1
intuition 1
fastening 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
i 1
have 1
driven 1
down 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
so 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
james 1
didnt 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
start 1
upon 1
your 1
work 1
knowing 1
it 1
too 1
never 1
let 1
yourself 1
doubt 1
upon 1
that 1
point 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
since 1
we 1
were 1
little 1
children 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
his 1
faults 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
does 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
too 1
tenderhearted 1
to 1
hurt 1
a 1
fly 1
such 1
a 1
charge 1
is 1
absurd 1
to 1
anyone 1
who 1
really 1
knows 1
him 1
i 1
hope 1
we 1
may 1
clear 1
him 1
miss 1
turner 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
you 1
may 1
rely 1
upon 1
my 1
doing 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
evidence 1
you 1
have 1
formed 1
some 1
conclusion 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
see 1
some 1
loophole 1
some 1
flaw 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
yourself 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable 1
there 1
now 1
she 1
cried 1
throwing 1
back 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
looking 1
defiantly 1
at 1
lestrade 1
you 1
hear 1
he 1
gives 1
me 1
hopes 1
lestrade 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
my 1
colleague 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
little 1
quick 1
in 1
forming 1
his 1
conclusions 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
right 1
oh 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
right 1
james 1
never 1
did 1
it 1
and 1
about 1
his 1
quarrel 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
about 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
coroner 1
was 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
concerned 1
in 1
it 1
in 1
what 1
way 1
asked 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
hide 1
anything 1
james 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
many 1
disagreements 1
about 1
me 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
was 1
very 1
anxious 1
that 1
there 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
marriage 1
between 1
us 1
james 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
is 1
young 1
and 1
has 1
seen 1
very 1
little 1
of 1
life 1
yet 1
andandwell 1
he 1
naturally 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
like 1
that 1
yet 1
so 1
there 1
were 1
quarrels 1
and 1
this 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
asked 1
holmes 1
was 1
he 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
union 1
no 1
he 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
it 1
also 1
no 1
one 1
but 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
was 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
quick 1
blush 1
passed 1
over 1
her 1
fresh 1
young 1
face 1
as 1
holmes 1
shot 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
keen 1
questioning 1
glances 1
at 1
her 1

dr 1
willows 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
wreck 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
nervous 1
system 1
is 1
shattered 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
alive 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
dad 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
in 1

god 1
help 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
undertaking 1
she 1
hurried 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
impulsively 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
entered 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
her 1
carriage 1
rattle 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
i 1
am 1
ashamed 1
of 1
you 1
holmes 1
said 1
lestrade 1
with 1
dignity 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
silence 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
raise 1
up 1
hopes 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
disappoint 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
overtender 1
of 1
heart 1
but 1
i 1
call 1
it 1
cruel 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
clearing 1
james 1
mccarthy 1
said 1
holmes 1
have 1
you 1
an 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
in 1
prison 1
yes 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
reconsider 1
my 1
resolution 1
about 1
going 1
out 1
we 1
have 1
still 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
train 1
to 1
hereford 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
tonight 1
ample 1
then 1
let 1
us 1
do 1
so 1
watson 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
very 1
slow 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
only 1
be 1
away 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
i 1
walked 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
wandered 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
finally 1
returning 1
to 1
the 1
hotel 1
where 1
i 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
interest 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
yellowbacked 1
novel 1
the 1
puny 1
plot 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
so 1
thin 1
however 1
when 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
deep 1
mystery 1
through 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
groping 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
attention 1
wander 1
so 1
continually 1
from 1
the 1
action 1
to 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
i 1
at 1
last 1
flung 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
gave 1
myself 1
up 1
entirely 1
to 1
a 1
consideration 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
supposing 1
that 1
this 1
unhappy 1
young 1
mans 1
story 1
were 1
absolutely 1
true 1
then 1
what 1
hellish 1
thing 1
what 1
absolutely 1
unforeseen 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
calamity 1
could 1
have 1
occurred 1
between 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
parted 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
drawn 1
back 1
by 1
his 1
screams 1
he 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
glade 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
terrible 1
and 1
deadly 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
might 1
not 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
injuries 1
reveal 1
something 1
to 1
my 1
medical 1
instincts 1
i 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
weekly 1
county 1
paper 1
which 1
contained 1
a 1
verbatim 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
inquest 1
in 1
the 1
surgeons 1
deposition 1
it 1
was 1
stated 1
that 1
the 1
posterior 1
third 1
of 1
the 1
left 1
parietal 1
bone 1
and 1
the 1
left 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
occipital 1
bone 1
had 1
been 1
shattered 1
by 1
a 1
heavy 1
blow 1
from 1
a 1
blunt 1
weapon 1
i 1
marked 1
the 1
spot 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
head 1
clearly 1
such 1
a 1
blow 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
struck 1
from 1
behind 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
accused 1
as 1
when 1
seen 1
quarrelling 1
he 1
was 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
still 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
for 1
very 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
older 1
man 1
might 1
have 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
before 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
still 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
call 1
holmes 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
peculiar 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
what 1
could 1
that 1
mean 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
delirium 1
a 1
man 1
dying 1
from 1
a 1
sudden 1
blow 1
does 1
not 1
commonly 1
become 1
delirious 1
no 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
explain 1
how 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
fate 1
but 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
indicate 1
i 1
cudgelled 1
my 1
brains 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
possible 1
explanation 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
grey 1
cloth 1
seen 1
by 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
if 1
that 1
were 1
true 1
the 1
murderer 1
must 1
have 1
dropped 1
some 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
dress 1
presumably 1
his 1
overcoat 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
hardihood 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
instant 1
when 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
kneeling 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
turned 1
not 1
a 1
dozen 1
paces 1
off 1
what 1
a 1
tissue 1
of 1
mysteries 1
and 1
improbabilities 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
wonder 1
at 1
lestrades 1
opinion 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
faith 1
in 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
insight 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
lose 1
hope 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
every 1
fresh 1
fact 1
seemed 1
to 1
strengthen 1
his 1
conviction 1
of 1
young 1
mccarthys 1
innocence 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
before 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
returned 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
alone 1
for 1
lestrade 1
was 1
staying 1
in 1
lodgings 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
the 1
glass 1
still 1
keeps 1
very 1
high 1
he 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
importance 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
rain 1
before 1
we 1
are 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
the 1
ground 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
his 1
very 1
best 1
and 1
keenest 1
for 1
such 1
nice 1
work 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
when 1
fagged 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
learn 1
from 1
him 1
nothing 1
could 1
he 1
throw 1
no 1
light 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
screening 1
him 1
or 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
convinced 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
puzzled 1
as 1
everyone 1
else 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
quickwitted 1
youth 1
though 1
comely 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
sound 1
at 1
heart 1
i 1
cannot 1
admire 1
his 1
taste 1
i 1
remarked 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
a 1
marriage 1
with 1
so 1
charming 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
as 1
this 1
miss 1
turner 1
ah 1
thereby 1
hangs 1
a 1
rather 1
painful 1
tale 1
this 1
fellow 1
is 1
madly 1
insanely 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
some 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
lad 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
really 1
knew 1
her 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
five 1
years 1
at 1
a 1
boardingschool 1
what 1
does 1
the 1
idiot 1
do 1
but 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
a 1
barmaid 1
in 1
bristol 1
and 1
marry 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
registry 1
office 1
no 1
one 1
knows 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
maddening 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
upbraided 1
for 1
not 1
doing 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
his 1
very 1
eyes 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
knows 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
impossible 1
it 1
was 1
sheer 1
frenzy 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
throw 1
his 1
hands 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
when 1
his 1
father 1
at 1
their 1
last 1
interview 1
was 1
goading 1
him 1
on 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
miss 1
turner 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
supporting 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
by 1
all 1
accounts 1
a 1
very 1
hard 1
man 1
would 1
have 1
thrown 1
him 1
over 1
utterly 1
had 1
he 1
known 1
the 1
truth 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
his 1
barmaid 1
wife 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
bristol 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
mark 1
that 1
point 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
importance 1
good 1
has 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
evil 1
however 1
for 1
the 1
barmaid 1
finding 1
from 1
the 1
papers 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
serious 1
trouble 1
and 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
hanged 1
has 1
thrown 1
him 1
over 1
utterly 1
and 1
has 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
husband 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
bermuda 1
dockyard 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
no 1
tie 1
between 1
them 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
that 1
bit 1
of 1
news 1
has 1
consoled 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
suffered 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
who 1
has 1
done 1
it 1
ah 1
who 1
i 1
would 1
call 1
your 1
attention 1
very 1
particularly 1
to 1
two 1
points 1
one 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
had 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
someone 1
at 1
the 1
pool 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
someone 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
son 1
for 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
when 1
he 1
would 1
return 1
the 1
second 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
was 1
heard 1
to 1
cry 1
cooee 1
before 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
son 1
had 1
returned 1
those 1
are 1
the 1
crucial 1
points 1
upon 1
which 1
the 1
case 1
depends 1
and 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
about 1
george 1
meredith 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
leave 1
all 1
minor 1
matters 1
until 1
tomorrow 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
rain 1
as 1
holmes 1
had 1
foretold 1
and 1
the 1
morning 1
broke 1
bright 1
and 1
cloudless 1
at 1
nine 1
oclock 1
lestrade 1
called 1
for 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
off 1
for 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
and 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
there 1
is 1
serious 1
news 1
this 1
morning 1
lestrade 1
observed 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
mr 1
turner 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
is 1
so 1
ill 1
that 1
his 1
life 1
is 1
despaired 1
of 1
an 1
elderly 1
man 1
i 1
presume 1
said 1
holmes 1
about 1
sixty 1
but 1
his 1
constitution 1
has 1
been 1
shattered 1
by 1
his 1
life 1
abroad 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
failing 1
health 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
this 1
business 1
has 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
effect 1
upon 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
of 1
mccarthys 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
add 1
a 1
great 1
benefactor 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
learned 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
rent 1
free 1
indeed 1
that 1
is 1
interesting 1
said 1
holmes 1
oh 1
yes 1
in 1
a 1
hundred 1
other 1
ways 1
he 1
has 1
helped 1
him 1
everybody 1
about 1
here 1
speaks 1
of 1
his 1
kindness 1
to 1
him 1
really 1
does 1
it 1
not 1
strike 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
little 1
singular 1
that 1
this 1
mccarthy 1
who 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
under 1
such 1
obligations 1
to 1
turner 1
should 1
still 1
talk 1
of 1
marrying 1
his 1
son 1
to 1
turners 1
daughter 1
who 1
is 1
presumably 1
heiress 1
to 1
the 1
estate 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
cocksure 1
manner 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
merely 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
a 1
proposal 1
and 1
all 1
else 1
would 1
follow 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
strange 1
since 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
turner 1
himself 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
the 1
daughter 1
told 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
deduce 1
something 1
from 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
deductions 1
and 1
the 1
inferences 1
said 1
lestrade 1
winking 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
hard 1
enough 1
to 1
tackle 1
facts 1
holmes 1
without 1
flying 1
away 1
after 1
theories 1
and 1
fancies 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
said 1
holmes 1
demurely 1
you 1
do 1
find 1
it 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
tackle 1
the 1
facts 1
anyhow 1
i 1
have 1
grasped 1
one 1
fact 1
which 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
replied 1
lestrade 1
with 1
some 1
warmth 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
mccarthy 1
senior 1
met 1
his 1
death 1
from 1
mccarthy 1
junior 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
theories 1
to 1
the 1
contrary 1
are 1
the 1
merest 1
moonshine 1
well 1
moonshine 1
is 1
a 1
brighter 1
thing 1
than 1
fog 1
said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
upon 1
the 1
left 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
widespread 1
comfortablelooking 1
building 1
twostoried 1
slateroofed 1
with 1
great 1
yellow 1
blotches 1
of 1
lichen 1
upon 1
the 1
grey 1
walls 1
the 1
drawn 1
blinds 1
and 1
the 1
smokeless 1
chimneys 1
however 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
stricken 1
look 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
this 1
horror 1
still 1
lay 1
heavy 1
upon 1
it 1
we 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
when 1
the 1
maid 1
at 1
holmes 1
request 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
boots 1
which 1
her 1
master 1
wore 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
and 1
also 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
the 1
sons 1
though 1
not 1
the 1
pair 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
then 1
had 1
having 1
measured 1
these 1
very 1
carefully 1
from 1
seven 1
or 1
eight 1
different 1
points 1
holmes 1
desired 1
to 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
courtyard 1
from 1
which 1
we 1
all 1
followed 1
the 1
winding 1
track 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
transformed 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
such 1
a 1
scent 1
as 1
this 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
only 1
known 1
the 1
quiet 1
thinker 1
and 1
logician 1
of 1
baker 1
street 1
would 1
have 1
failed 1
to 1
recognise 1
him 1
his 1
face 1
flushed 1
and 1
darkened 1
his 1
brows 1
were 1
drawn 1
into 1
two 1
hard 1
black 1
lines 1
while 1
his 1
eyes 1
shone 1
out 1
from 1
beneath 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
steely 1
glitter 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
bent 1
downward 1
his 1
shoulders 1
bowed 1
his 1
lips 1
compressed 1
and 1
the 1
veins 1
stood 1
out 1
like 1
whipcord 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
sinewy 1
neck 1
his 1
nostrils 1
seemed 1
to 1
dilate 1
with 1
a 1
purely 1
animal 1
lust 1
for 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
so 1
absolutely 1
concentrated 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
before 1
him 1
that 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
remark 1
fell 1
unheeded 1
upon 1
his 1
ears 1
or 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
only 1
provoked 1
a 1
quick 1
impatient 1
snarl 1
in 1
reply 1
swiftly 1
and 1
silently 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
along 1
the 1
track 1
which 1
ran 1
through 1
the 1
meadows 1
and 1
so 1
by 1
way 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
it 1
was 1
damp 1
marshy 1
ground 1
as 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
district 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
marks 1
of 1
many 1
feet 1
both 1
upon 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
amid 1
the 1
short 1
grass 1
which 1
bounded 1
it 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
sometimes 1
holmes 1
would 1
hurry 1
on 1
sometimes 1
stop 1
dead 1
and 1
once 1
he 1
made 1
quite 1
a 1
little 1
detour 1
into 1
the 1
meadow 1
lestrade 1
and 1
i 1
walked 1
behind 1
him 1
the 1
detective 1
indifferent 1
and 1
contemptuous 1
while 1
i 1
watched 1
my 1
friend 1
with 1
the 1
interest 1
which 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
actions 1
was 1
directed 1
towards 1
a 1
definite 1
end 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
reedgirt 1
sheet 1
of 1
water 1
some 1
fifty 1
yards 1
across 1
is 1
situated 1
at 1
the 1
boundary 1
between 1
the 1
hatherley 1
farm 1
and 1
the 1
private 1
park 1
of 1
the 1
wealthy 1
mr 1
turner 1
above 1
the 1
woods 1
which 1
lined 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
farther 1
side 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
red 1
jutting 1
pinnacles 1
which 1
marked 1
the 1
site 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
landowners 1
dwelling 1
on 1
the 1
hatherley 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
pool 1
the 1
woods 1
grew 1
very 1
thick 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
belt 1
of 1
sodden 1
grass 1
twenty 1
paces 1
across 1
between 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
reeds 1
which 1
lined 1
the 1
lake 1
lestrade 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
exact 1
spot 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
and 1
indeed 1
so 1
moist 1
was 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
plainly 1
see 1
the 1
traces 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
by 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
the 1
stricken 1
man 1
to 1
holmes 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
eager 1
face 1
and 1
peering 1
eyes 1
very 1
many 1
other 1
things 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
read 1
upon 1
the 1
trampled 1
grass 1
he 1
ran 1
round 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
who 1
is 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
scent 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
pool 1
for 1
he 1
asked 1
i 1
fished 1
about 1
with 1
a 1
rake 1
i 1
thought 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
some 1
weapon 1
or 1
other 1
trace 1
but 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
oh 1
tut 1
tut 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
time 1
that 1
left 1
foot 1
of 1
yours 1
with 1
its 1
inward 1
twist 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
a 1
mole 1
could 1
trace 1
it 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
vanishes 1
among 1
the 1
reeds 1
oh 1
how 1
simple 1
it 1
would 1
all 1
have 1
been 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
here 1
before 1
they 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
herd 1
of 1
buffalo 1
and 1
wallowed 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
here 1
is 1
where 1
the 1
party 1
with 1
the 1
lodgekeeper 1
came 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
covered 1
all 1
tracks 1
for 1
six 1
or 1
eight 1
feet 1
round 1
the 1
body 1
but 1
here 1
are 1
three 1
separate 1
tracks 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
feet 1
he 1
drew 1
out 1
a 1
lens 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
waterproof 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
better 1
view 1
talking 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
rather 1
to 1
himself 1
than 1
to 1
us 1
these 1
are 1
young 1
mccarthys 1
feet 1
twice 1
he 1
was 1
walking 1
and 1
once 1
he 1
ran 1
swiftly 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
soles 1
are 1
deeply 1
marked 1
and 1
the 1
heels 1
hardly 1
visible 1
that 1
bears 1
out 1
his 1
story 1
he 1
ran 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
father 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
then 1
here 1
are 1
the 1
fathers 1
feet 1
as 1
he 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
buttend 1
of 1
the 1
gun 1
as 1
the 1
son 1
stood 1
listening 1
and 1
this 1
ha 1
ha 1
what 1
have 1
we 1
here 1
tiptoes 1
tiptoes 1
square 1
too 1
quite 1
unusual 1
boots 1
they 1
come 1
they 1
go 1
they 1
come 1
againof 1
course 1
that 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
cloak 1
now 1
where 1
did 1
they 1
come 1
from 1
he 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
sometimes 1
losing 1
sometimes 1
finding 1
the 1
track 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
within 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
beech 1
the 1
largest 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
holmes 1
traced 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
farther 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
remained 1
there 1
turning 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
dried 1
sticks 1
gathering 1
up 1
what 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
dust 1
into 1
an 1
envelope 1
and 1
examining 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
bark 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
a 1
jagged 1
stone 1
was 1
lying 1
among 1
the 1
moss 1
and 1
this 1
also 1
he 1
carefully 1
examined 1
and 1
retained 1
then 1
he 1
followed 1
a 1
pathway 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
where 1
all 1
traces 1
were 1
lost 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
considerable 1
interest 1
he 1
remarked 1
returning 1
to 1
his 1
natural 1
manner 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
this 1
grey 1
house 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
lodge 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
word 1
with 1
moran 1
and 1
perhaps 1
write 1
a 1
little 1
note 1
having 1
done 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
drive 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
luncheon 1
you 1
may 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
presently 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
before 1
we 1
regained 1
our 1
cab 1
and 1
drove 1
back 1
into 1
ross 1
holmes 1
still 1
carrying 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
stone 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
picked 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
this 1
may 1
interest 1
you 1
lestrade 1
he 1
remarked 1
holding 1
it 1
out 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
marks 1
there 1
are 1
none 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
then 1
the 1
grass 1
was 1
growing 1
under 1
it 1
it 1
had 1
only 1
lain 1
there 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
whence 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
it 1
corresponds 1
with 1
the 1
injuries 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
weapon 1
and 1
the 1
murderer 1
is 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
lefthanded 1
limps 1
with 1
the 1
right 1
leg 1
wears 1
thicksoled 1
shootingboots 1
and 1
a 1
grey 1
cloak 1
smokes 1
indian 1
cigars 1
uses 1
a 1
cigarholder 1
and 1
carries 1
a 1
blunt 1
penknife 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
other 1
indications 1
but 1
these 1
may 1
be 1
enough 1
to 1
aid 1
us 1
in 1
our 1
search 1
lestrade 1
laughed 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
a 1
sceptic 1
he 1
said 1
theories 1
are 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
a 1
hardheaded 1
british 1
jury 1
nous 1
verrons 1
answered 1
holmes 1
calmly 1
you 1
work 1
your 1
own 1
method 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
work 1
mine 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
busy 1
this 1
afternoon 1
and 1
shall 1
probably 1
return 1
to 1
london 1
by 1
the 1
evening 1
train 1
and 1
leave 1
your 1
case 1
unfinished 1
no 1
finished 1
but 1
the 1
mystery 1
it 1
is 1
solved 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
criminal 1
then 1
the 1
gentleman 1
i 1
describe 1
but 1
who 1
is 1
he 1
surely 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
difficult 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
populous 1
neighbourhood 1
lestrade 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
practical 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
i 1
really 1
cannot 1
undertake 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
lefthanded 1
gentleman 1
with 1
a 1
game 1
leg 1
i 1
should 1
become 1
the 1
laughingstock 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
holmes 1
quietly 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
the 1
chance 1
here 1
are 1
your 1
lodgings 1
goodbye 1
i 1
shall 1
drop 1
you 1
a 1
line 1
before 1
i 1
leave 1
having 1
left 1
lestrade 1
at 1
his 1
rooms 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
our 1
hotel 1
where 1
we 1
found 1
lunch 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
holmes 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
buried 1
in 1
thought 1
with 1
a 1
pained 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
finds 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
perplexing 1
position 1
look 1
here 1
watson 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
the 1
cloth 1
was 1
cleared 1
just 1
sit 1
down 1
in 1
this 1
chair 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
quite 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
value 1
your 1
advice 1
light 1
a 1
cigar 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
expound 1
pray 1
do 1
so 1
well 1
now 1
in 1
considering 1
this 1
case 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
points 1
about 1
young 1
mccarthys 1
narrative 1
which 1
struck 1
us 1
both 1
instantly 1
although 1
they 1
impressed 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
and 1
you 1
against 1
him 1
one 1
was 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
should 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
account 1
cry 1
cooee 1
before 1
seeing 1
him 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
his 1
singular 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
he 1
mumbled 1
several 1
words 1
you 1
understand 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
caught 1
the 1
sons 1
ear 1
now 1
from 1
this 1
double 1
point 1
our 1
research 1
must 1
commence 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
begin 1
it 1
by 1
presuming 1
that 1
what 1
the 1
lad 1
says 1
is 1
absolutely 1
true 1
what 1
of 1
this 1
cooee 1
then 1
well 1
obviously 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
meant 1
for 1
the 1
son 1
the 1
son 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
in 1
bristol 1
it 1
was 1
mere 1
chance 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
within 1
earshot 1
the 1
cooee 1
was 1
meant 1
to 1
attract 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
whoever 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
appointment 1
with 1
but 1
cooee 1
is 1
a 1
distinctly 1
australian 1
cry 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
used 1
between 1
australians 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
strong 1
presumption 1
that 1
the 1
person 1
whom 1
mccarthy 1
expected 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
was 1
someone 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
australia 1
what 1
of 1
the 1
rat 1
then 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
took 1
a 1
folded 1
paper 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
flattened 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
colony 1
of 1
victoria 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
wired 1
to 1
bristol 1
for 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
map 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
read 1
arat 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
hand 1
ballarat 1
quite 1
so 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
word 1
the 1
man 1
uttered 1
and 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
son 1
only 1
caught 1
the 1
last 1
two 1
syllables 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
utter 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
his 1
murderer 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
ballarat 1
it 1
is 1
wonderful 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
i 1
had 1
narrowed 1
the 1
field 1
down 1
considerably 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
a 1
grey 1
garment 1
was 1
a 1
third 1
point 1
which 1
granting 1
the 1
sons 1
statement 1
to 1
be 1
correct 1
was 1
a 1
certainty 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
now 1
out 1
of 1
mere 1
vagueness 1
to 1
the 1
definite 1
conception 1
of 1
an 1
australian 1
from 1
ballarat 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
cloak 1
certainly 1
and 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
district 1
for 1
the 1
pool 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
approached 1
by 1
the 1
farm 1
or 1
by 1
the 1
estate 1
where 1
strangers 1
could 1
hardly 1
wander 1
quite 1
so 1
then 1
comes 1
our 1
expedition 1
of 1
today 1
by 1
an 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
gained 1
the 1
trifling 1
details 1
which 1
i 1
gave 1
to 1
that 1
imbecile 1
lestrade 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
the 1
criminal 1
but 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
gain 1
them 1
you 1
know 1
my 1
method 1
it 1
is 1
founded 1
upon 1
the 1
observation 1
of 1
trifles 1
his 1
height 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
roughly 1
judge 1
from 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
his 1
stride 1
his 1
boots 1
too 1
might 1
be 1
told 1
from 1
their 1
traces 1
yes 1
they 1
were 1
peculiar 1
boots 1
but 1
his 1
lameness 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
his 1
right 1
foot 1
was 1
always 1
less 1
distinct 1
than 1
his 1
left 1
he 1
put 1
less 1
weight 1
upon 1
it 1
why 1
because 1
he 1
limpedhe 1
was 1
lame 1
but 1
his 1
lefthandedness 1
you 1
were 1
yourself 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
injury 1
as 1
recorded 1
by 1
the 1
surgeon 1
at 1
the 1
inquest 1
the 1
blow 1
was 1
struck 1
from 1
immediately 1
behind 1
and 1
yet 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
now 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
by 1
a 1
lefthanded 1
man 1
he 1
had 1
stood 1
behind 1
that 1
tree 1
during 1
the 1
interview 1
between 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
son 1
he 1
had 1
even 1
smoked 1
there 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
ash 1
of 1
a 1
cigar 1
which 1
my 1
special 1
knowledge 1
of 1
tobacco 1
ashes 1
enables 1
me 1
to 1
pronounce 1
as 1
an 1
indian 1
cigar 1
i 1
have 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
devoted 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
this 1
and 1
written 1
a 1
little 1
monograph 1
on 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
140 1
different 1
varieties 1
of 1
pipe 1
cigar 1
and 1
cigarette 1
tobacco 1
having 1
found 1
the 1
ash 1
i 1
then 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
discovered 1
the 1
stump 1
among 1
the 1
moss 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
tossed 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
indian 1
cigar 1
of 1
the 1
variety 1
which 1
are 1
rolled 1
in 1
rotterdam 1
and 1
the 1
cigarholder 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
end 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
therefore 1
he 1
used 1
a 1
holder 1
the 1
tip 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
not 1
bitten 1
off 1
but 1
the 1
cut 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
clean 1
one 1
so 1
i 1
deduced 1
a 1
blunt 1
penknife 1
holmes 1
i 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
drawn 1
a 1
net 1
round 1
this 1
man 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
cannot 1
escape 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
an 1
innocent 1
human 1
life 1
as 1
truly 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
cut 1
the 1
cord 1
which 1
was 1
hanging 1
him 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
all 1
this 1
points 1
the 1
culprit 1
is 1
mr 1
john 1
turner 1
cried 1
the 1
hotel 1
waiter 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
our 1
sittingroom 1
and 1
ushering 1
in 1
a 1
visitor 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
impressive 1
figure 1
his 1
slow 1
limping 1
step 1
and 1
bowed 1
shoulders 1
gave 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
decrepitude 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
hard 1
deeplined 1
craggy 1
features 1
and 1
his 1
enormous 1
limbs 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
possessed 1
of 1
unusual 1
strength 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
of 1
character 1
his 1
tangled 1
beard 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
and 1
outstanding 1
drooping 1
eyebrows 1
combined 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
dignity 1
and 1
power 1
to 1
his 1
appearance 1
but 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
of 1
an 1
ashen 1
white 1
while 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
his 1
nostrils 1
were 1
tinged 1
with 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
blue 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
grip 1
of 1
some 1
deadly 1
and 1
chronic 1
disease 1
pray 1
sit 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
said 1
holmes 1
gently 1
you 1
had 1
my 1
note 1
yes 1
the 1
lodgekeeper 1
brought 1
it 1
up 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
here 1
to 1
avoid 1
scandal 1
i 1
thought 1
people 1
would 1
talk 1
if 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
he 1
looked 1
across 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
with 1
despair 1
in 1
his 1
weary 1
eyes 1
as 1
though 1
his 1
question 1
was 1
already 1
answered 1
yes 1
said 1
holmes 1
answering 1
the 1
look 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
words 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
i 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
mccarthy 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
sank 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
god 1
help 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
let 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
come 1
to 1
harm 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
went 1
against 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
assizes 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
said 1
holmes 1
gravely 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
now 1
had 1
it 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
my 1
dear 1
girl 1
it 1
would 1
break 1
her 1
heartit 1
will 1
break 1
her 1
heart 1
when 1
she 1
hears 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
arrested 1
it 1
may 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
said 1
holmes 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
official 1
agent 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
daughter 1
who 1
required 1
my 1
presence 1
here 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
acting 1
in 1
her 1
interests 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
must 1
be 1
got 1
off 1
however 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
dying 1
man 1
said 1
old 1
turner 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
diabetes 1
for 1
years 1
my 1
doctor 1
says 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
i 1
shall 1
live 1
a 1
month 1
yet 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
die 1
under 1
my 1
own 1
roof 1
than 1
in 1
a 1
gaol 1
holmes 1
rose 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
pen 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
paper 1
before 1
him 1
just 1
tell 1
us 1
the 1
truth 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
shall 1
jot 1
down 1
the 1
facts 1
you 1
will 1
sign 1
it 1
and 1
watson 1
here 1
can 1
witness 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
could 1
produce 1
your 1
confession 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
extremity 1
to 1
save 1
young 1
mccarthy 1
i 1
promise 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
use 1
it 1
unless 1
it 1
is 1
absolutely 1
needed 1
its 1
as 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
its 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
i 1
shall 1
live 1
to 1
the 1
assizes 1
so 1
it 1
matters 1
little 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
spare 1
alice 1
the 1
shock 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
acting 1
but 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
didnt 1
know 1
this 1
dead 1
man 1
mccarthy 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
devil 1
incarnate 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
god 1
keep 1
you 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
he 1
his 1
grip 1
has 1
been 1
upon 1
me 1
these 1
twenty 1
years 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
blasted 1
my 1
life 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
first 1
how 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
60s 1
at 1
the 1
diggings 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
chap 1
then 1
hotblooded 1
and 1
reckless 1
ready 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
hand 1
at 1
anything 1
i 1
got 1
among 1
bad 1
companions 1
took 1
to 1
drink 1
had 1
no 1
luck 1
with 1
my 1
claim 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
became 1
what 1
you 1
would 1
call 1
over 1
here 1
a 1
highway 1
robber 1
there 1
were 1
six 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
free 1
life 1
of 1
it 1
sticking 1
up 1
a 1
station 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
or 1
stopping 1
the 1
wagons 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
the 1
diggings 1
black 1
jack 1
of 1
ballarat 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
i 1
went 1
under 1
and 1
our 1
party 1
is 1
still 1
remembered 1
in 1
the 1
colony 1
as 1
the 1
ballarat 1
gang 1
one 1
day 1
a 1
gold 1
convoy 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
ballarat 1
to 1
melbourne 1
and 1
we 1
lay 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
attacked 1
it 1
there 1
were 1
six 1
troopers 1
and 1
six 1
of 1
us 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
close 1
thing 1
but 1
we 1
emptied 1
four 1
of 1
their 1
saddles 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
volley 1
three 1
of 1
our 1
boys 1
were 1
killed 1
however 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
swag 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
pistol 1
to 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
wagondriver 1
who 1
was 1
this 1
very 1
man 1
mccarthy 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
the 1
lord 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
shot 1
him 1
then 1
but 1
i 1
spared 1
him 1
though 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
wicked 1
little 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
remember 1
every 1
feature 1
we 1
got 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
gold 1
became 1
wealthy 1
men 1
and 1
made 1
our 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
england 1
without 1
being 1
suspected 1
there 1
i 1
parted 1
from 1
my 1
old 1
pals 1
and 1
determined 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
quiet 1
and 1
respectable 1
life 1
i 1
bought 1
this 1
estate 1
which 1
chanced 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
i 1
set 1
myself 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
little 1
good 1
with 1
my 1
money 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
earned 1
it 1
i 1
married 1
too 1
and 1
though 1
my 1
wife 1
died 1
young 1
she 1
left 1
me 1
my 1
dear 1
little 1
alice 1
even 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
baby 1
her 1
wee 1
hand 1
seemed 1
to 1
lead 1
me 1
down 1
the 1
right 1
path 1
as 1
nothing 1
else 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
i 1
turned 1
over 1
a 1
new 1
leaf 1
and 1
did 1
my 1
best 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
past 1
all 1
was 1
going 1
well 1
when 1
mccarthy 1
laid 1
his 1
grip 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
about 1
an 1
investment 1
and 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
in 1
regent 1
street 1
with 1
hardly 1
a 1
coat 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
a 1
boot 1
to 1
his 1
foot 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
jack 1
says 1
he 1
touching 1
me 1

no 1
peace 1
no 1
forgetfulness 1
turn 1
where 1
i 1
would 1
there 1
was 1
his 1
cunning 1
grinning 1
face 1
at 1
my 1
elbow 1
it 1
grew 1
worse 1
as 1
alice 1
grew 1
up 1
for 1
he 1
soon 1
saw 1
i 1
was 1
more 1
afraid 1
of 1
her 1
knowing 1
my 1
past 1
than 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
whatever 1
he 1
wanted 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
and 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
without 1
question 1
land 1
money 1
houses 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
thing 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
give 1
he 1
asked 1
for 1
alice 1
his 1
son 1
you 1
see 1
had 1
grown 1
up 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
my 1
girl 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
weak 1
health 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
fine 1
stroke 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
lad 1
should 1
step 1
into 1
the 1
whole 1
property 1
but 1
there 1
i 1
was 1
firm 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
his 1
cursed 1
stock 1
mixed 1
with 1
mine 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
any 1
dislike 1
to 1
the 1
lad 1
but 1
his 1
blood 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
i 1
stood 1
firm 1
mccarthy 1
threatened 1
i 1
braved 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
his 1
worst 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
the 1
pool 1
midway 1
between 1
our 1
houses 1
to 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
down 1
there 1
i 1
found 1
him 1
talking 1
with 1
his 1
son 1
so 1
i 1
smoked 1
a 1
cigar 1
and 1
waited 1
behind 1
a 1
tree 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
alone 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
talk 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
black 1
and 1
bitter 1
in 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
uppermost 1
he 1
was 1
urging 1
his 1
son 1
to 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
with 1
as 1
little 1
regard 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
might 1
think 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
a 1
slut 1
from 1
off 1
the 1
streets 1
it 1
drove 1
me 1
mad 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
held 1
most 1
dear 1
should 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
this 1
could 1
i 1
not 1
snap 1
the 1
bond 1
i 1
was 1
already 1
a 1
dying 1
and 1
a 1
desperate 1
man 1
though 1
clear 1
of 1
mind 1
and 1
fairly 1
strong 1
of 1
limb 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
fate 1
was 1
sealed 1
but 1
my 1
memory 1
and 1
my 1
girl 1
both 1
could 1
be 1
saved 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
silence 1
that 1
foul 1
tongue 1
i 1
did 1
it 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
again 1
deeply 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
sinned 1
i 1
have 1
led 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
martyrdom 1
to 1
atone 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
girl 1
should 1
be 1
entangled 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
meshes 1
which 1
held 1
me 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
could 1
suffer 1
i 1
struck 1
him 1
down 1
with 1
no 1
more 1
compunction 1
than 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
foul 1
and 1
venomous 1
beast 1
his 1
cry 1
brought 1
back 1
his 1
son 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
gained 1
the 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
cloak 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
dropped 1
in 1
my 1
flight 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
story 1
gentlemen 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
occurred 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
judge 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
signed 1
the 1
statement 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
out 1
i 1
pray 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
exposed 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
temptation 1
i 1
pray 1
not 1
sir 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
view 1
of 1
your 1
health 1
nothing 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
aware 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
to 1
answer 1
for 1
your 1
deed 1
at 1
a 1
higher 1
court 1
than 1
the 1
assizes 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
your 1
confession 1
and 1
if 1
mccarthy 1
is 1
condemned 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
if 1
not 1
it 1
shall 1
never 1
be 1
seen 1
by 1
mortal 1
eye 1
and 1
your 1
secret 1
whether 1
you 1
be 1
alive 1
or 1
dead 1
shall 1
be 1
safe 1
with 1
us 1
farewell 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
solemnly 1
your 1
own 1
deathbeds 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
easier 1
for 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
to 1
mine 1
tottering 1
and 1
shaking 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
giant 1
frame 1
he 1
stumbled 1
slowly 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
god 1
help 1
us 1
said 1
holmes 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
why 1
does 1
fate 1
play 1
such 1
tricks 1
with 1
poor 1
helpless 1
worms 1
i 1
never 1
hear 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
as 1
this 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
baxters 1
words 1
and 1
say 1
there 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
god 1
goes 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
james 1
mccarthy 1
was 1
acquitted 1
at 1
the 1
assizes 1
on 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
objections 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
out 1
by 1
holmes 1
and 1
submitted 1
to 1
the 1
defending 1
counsel 1
old 1
turner 1
lived 1
for 1
seven 1
months 1
after 1
our 1
interview 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
dead 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
every 1
prospect 1
that 1
the 1
son 1
and 1
daughter 1
may 1
come 1
to 1
live 1
happily 1
together 1
in 1
ignorance 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
cloud 1
which 1
rests 1
upon 1
their 1
past 1
adventure 1
v 1
the 1
five 1
orange 1
pips 1
when 1
i 1
glance 1
over 1
my 1
notes 1
and 1
records 1
of 1
the 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
cases 1
between 1
the 1
years 1
82 1
and 1
90 1
i 1
am 1
faced 1
by 1
so 1
many 1
which 1
present 1
strange 1
and 1
interesting 1
features 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
easy 1
matter 1
to 1
know 1
which 1
to 1
choose 1
and 1
which 1
to 1
leave 1
some 1
however 1
have 1
already 1
gained 1
publicity 1
through 1
the 1
papers 1
and 1
others 1
have 1
not 1
offered 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
those 1
peculiar 1
qualities 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
possessed 1
in 1
so 1
high 1
a 1
degree 1
and 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
these 1
papers 1
to 1
illustrate 1
some 1
too 1
have 1
baffled 1
his 1
analytical 1
skill 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
narratives 1
beginnings 1
without 1
an 1
ending 1
while 1
others 1
have 1
been 1
but 1
partially 1
cleared 1
up 1
and 1
have 1
their 1
explanations 1
founded 1
rather 1
upon 1
conjecture 1
and 1
surmise 1
than 1
on 1
that 1
absolute 1
logical 1
proof 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
there 1
is 1
however 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
last 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
remarkable 1
in 1
its 1
details 1
and 1
so 1
startling 1
in 1
its 1
results 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
tempted 1
to 1
give 1
some 1
account 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
which 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
probably 1
never 1
will 1
be 1
entirely 1
cleared 1
up 1
the 1
year 1
87 1
furnished 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
series 1
of 1
cases 1
of 1
greater 1
or 1
less 1
interest 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
retain 1
the 1
records 1
among 1
my 1
headings 1
under 1
this 1
one 1
twelve 1
months 1
i 1
find 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
paradol 1
chamber 1
of 1
the 1
amateur 1
mendicant 1
society 1
who 1
held 1
a 1
luxurious 1
club 1
in 1
the 1
lower 1
vault 1
of 1
a 1
furniture 1
warehouse 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
british 1
barque 1
sophy 1
anderson 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
adventures 1
of 1
the 1
grice 1
patersons 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
of 1
uffa 1
and 1
finally 1
of 1
the 1
camberwell 1
poisoning 1
case 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
as 1
may 1
be 1
remembered 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
able 1
by 1
winding 1
up 1
the 1
dead 1
mans 1
watch 1
to 1
prove 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
wound 1
up 1
two 1
hours 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
therefore 1
the 1
deceased 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
within 1
that 1
timea 1
deduction 1
which 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
importance 1
in 1
clearing 1
up 1
the 1
case 1
all 1
these 1
i 1
may 1
sketch 1
out 1
at 1
some 1
future 1
date 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
present 1
such 1
singular 1
features 1
as 1
the 1
strange 1
train 1
of 1
circumstances 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
now 1
taken 1
up 1
my 1
pen 1
to 1
describe 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
days 1
of 1
september 1
and 1
the 1
equinoctial 1
gales 1
had 1
set 1
in 1
with 1
exceptional 1
violence 1
all 1
day 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
screamed 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
had 1
beaten 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
great 1
handmade 1
london 1
we 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
raise 1
our 1
minds 1
for 1
the 1
instant 1
from 1
the 1
routine 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
recognise 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
those 1
great 1
elemental 1
forces 1
which 1
shriek 1
at 1
mankind 1
through 1
the 1
bars 1
of 1
his 1
civilisation 1
like 1
untamed 1
beasts 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
as 1
evening 1
drew 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
grew 1
higher 1
and 1
louder 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
cried 1
and 1
sobbed 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
moodily 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
fireplace 1
crossindexing 1
his 1
records 1
of 1
crime 1
while 1
i 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
deep 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
clark 1
russells 1
fine 1
seastories 1
until 1
the 1
howl 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
from 1
without 1
seemed 1
to 1
blend 1
with 1
the 1
text 1
and 1
the 1
splash 1
of 1
the 1
rain 1
to 1
lengthen 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
long 1
swash 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
waves 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
her 1
mothers 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
dweller 1
once 1
more 1
in 1
my 1
old 1
quarters 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
why 1
said 1
i 1
glancing 1
up 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
that 1
was 1
surely 1
the 1
bell 1
who 1
could 1
come 1
tonight 1
some 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
perhaps 1
except 1
yourself 1
i 1
have 1
none 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
encourage 1
visitors 1
a 1
client 1
then 1
if 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
serious 1
case 1
nothing 1
less 1
would 1
bring 1
a 1
man 1
out 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
hour 1
but 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
some 1
crony 1
of 1
the 1
landladys 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
wrong 1
in 1
his 1
conjecture 1
however 1
for 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
step 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
long 1
arm 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
lamp 1
away 1
from 1
himself 1
and 1
towards 1
the 1
vacant 1
chair 1
upon 1
which 1
a 1
newcomer 1
must 1
sit 1
come 1
in 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
young 1
some 1
twoandtwenty 1
at 1
the 1
outside 1
wellgroomed 1
and 1
trimly 1
clad 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
refinement 1
and 1
delicacy 1
in 1
his 1
bearing 1
the 1
streaming 1
umbrella 1
which 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
his 1
long 1
shining 1
waterproof 1
told 1
of 1
the 1
fierce 1
weather 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
he 1
looked 1
about 1
him 1
anxiously 1
in 1
the 1
glare 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
pale 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
heavy 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
weighed 1
down 1
with 1
some 1
great 1
anxiety 1
i 1
owe 1
you 1
an 1
apology 1
he 1
said 1
raising 1
his 1
golden 1
pincenez 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
intruding 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
brought 1
some 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
storm 1
and 1
rain 1
into 1
your 1
snug 1
chamber 1
give 1
me 1
your 1
coat 1
and 1
umbrella 1
said 1
holmes 1
they 1
may 1
rest 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
hook 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
dry 1
presently 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
up 1
from 1

last 1
court 1
of 1
appeal 1

question 1
sir 1
whether 1
in 1
all 1
your 1
experience 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
mysterious 1
and 1
inexplicable 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
than 1
those 1
which 1
have 1
happened 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
family 1
you 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
interest 1

give 1
us 1
the 1
essential 1
facts 1
from 1
the 1
commencement 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
afterwards 1
question 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
those 1
details 1
which 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
most 1
important 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
pulled 1
his 1
chair 1
up 1
and 1
pushed 1
his 1
wet 1
feet 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
blaze 1
my 1
name 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
john 1
openshaw 1
but 1
my 1
own 1
affairs 1
have 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
understand 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
this 1
awful 1
business 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
hereditary 1
matter 1
so 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
that 1
my 1
grandfather 1
had 1
two 1
sonsmy 1
uncle 1
elias 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
joseph 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
a 1
small 1
factory 1
at 1
coventry 1
which 1
he 1
enlarged 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
invention 1
of 1
bicycling 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
patentee 1
of 1
the 1
openshaw 1
unbreakable 1
tire 1
and 1
his 1
business 1
met 1
with 1
such 1
success 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
retire 1
upon 1
a 1
handsome 1
competence 1
my 1
uncle 1
elias 1
emigrated 1
to 1
america 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
planter 1
in 1
florida 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
reported 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
very 1
well 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
he 1
fought 1
in 1
jacksons 1
army 1
and 1
afterwards 1
under 1
hood 1
where 1
he 1
rose 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
colonel 1
when 1
lee 1
laid 1
down 1
his 1
arms 1
my 1
uncle 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
plantation 1
where 1
he 1
remained 1
for 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
years 1
about 1
1869 1
or 1
1870 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
europe 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
small 1
estate 1
in 1
sussex 1
near 1
horsham 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
considerable 1
fortune 1
in 1
the 1
states 1
and 1
his 1
reason 1
for 1
leaving 1
them 1
was 1
his 1
aversion 1
to 1
the 1
negroes 1
and 1
his 1
dislike 1
of 1
the 1
republican 1
policy 1
in 1
extending 1
the 1
franchise 1
to 1
them 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
man 1
fierce 1
and 1
quicktempered 1
very 1
foulmouthed 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
angry 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
retiring 1
disposition 1
during 1
all 1
the 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
lived 1
at 1
horsham 1
i 1
doubt 1
if 1
ever 1
he 1
set 1
foot 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
fields 1
round 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
his 1
exercise 1
though 1
very 1
often 1
for 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
leave 1
his 1
room 1
he 1
drank 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
smoked 1
very 1
heavily 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
no 1
society 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
any 1
friends 1
not 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
brother 1
he 1
didnt 1
mind 1
me 1
in 1
fact 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
fancy 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
first 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
youngster 1
of 1
twelve 1
or 1
so 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
1878 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
eight 1
or 1
nine 1
years 1
in 1
england 1
he 1
begged 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sober 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
fond 1
of 1
playing 1
backgammon 1
and 1
draughts 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
me 1
his 1
representative 1
both 1
with 1
the 1
servants 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
tradespeople 1
so 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
sixteen 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
kept 1
all 1
the 1
keys 1
and 1
could 1
go 1
where 1
i 1
liked 1
and 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
liked 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
disturb 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
privacy 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
singular 1
exception 1
however 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
single 1
room 1
a 1
lumberroom 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
attics 1
which 1
was 1
invariably 1
locked 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
permit 1
either 1
me 1
or 1
anyone 1
else 1
to 1
enter 1
with 1
a 1
boys 1
curiosity 1
i 1
have 1
peeped 1
through 1
the 1
keyhole 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
than 1
such 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
old 1
trunks 1
and 1
bundles 1
as 1
would 1
be 1
expected 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
room 1
one 1
dayit 1
was 1
in 1
march 1
1883a 1
letter 1
with 1
a 1
foreign 1
stamp 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
colonels 1
plate 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
common 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
receive 1
letters 1
for 1
his 1
bills 1
were 1
all 1
paid 1
in 1
ready 1
money 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
friends 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
from 1
india 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
pondicherry 1
postmark 1
what 1
can 1
this 1
be 1
opening 1
it 1
hurriedly 1
out 1
there 1
jumped 1
five 1
little 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
which 1
pattered 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
plate 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
laugh 1
at 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
laugh 1
was 1
struck 1
from 1
my 1
lips 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
his 1
lip 1
had 1
fallen 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
protruding 1
his 1
skin 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
putty 1
and 1
he 1
glared 1
at 1
the 1
envelope 1
which 1
he 1
still 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
trembling 1
hand 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
he 1
shrieked 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
god 1
my 1
god 1
my 1
sins 1
have 1
overtaken 1
me 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
uncle 1
i 1
cried 1
death 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
retired 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
leaving 1
me 1
palpitating 1
with 1
horror 1
i 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
envelope 1
and 1
saw 1
scrawled 1
in 1
red 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
inner 1
flap 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
gum 1
the 1
letter 1
k 1
three 1
times 1
repeated 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
save 1
the 1
five 1
dried 1
pips 1
what 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
reason 1
of 1
his 1
overpowering 1
terror 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
breakfasttable 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
ascended 1
the 1
stair 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
coming 1
down 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
key 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
attic 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
brass 1
box 1
like 1
a 1
cashbox 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
may 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
like 1
but 1
ill 1
checkmate 1
them 1
still 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
an 1
oath 1
tell 1
mary 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
want 1
a 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
today 1
and 1
send 1
down 1
to 1
fordham 1
the 1
horsham 1
lawyer 1
i 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
ordered 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
lawyer 1
arrived 1
i 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
step 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
fire 1
was 1
burning 1
brightly 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
grate 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
black 1
fluffy 1
ashes 1
as 1
of 1
burned 1
paper 1
while 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
stood 1
open 1
and 1
empty 1
beside 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
box 1
i 1
noticed 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
that 1
upon 1
the 1
lid 1
was 1
printed 1
the 1
treble 1
k 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
upon 1
the 1
envelope 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
john 1
said 1
my 1
uncle 1
to 1
witness 1
my 1
will 1
i 1
leave 1
my 1
estate 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
advantages 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
disadvantages 1
to 1
my 1
brother 1
your 1
father 1
whence 1
it 1
will 1
no 1
doubt 1
descend 1
to 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
enjoy 1
it 1
in 1
peace 1
well 1
and 1
good 1
if 1
you 1
find 1
you 1
cannot 1
take 1
my 1
advice 1
my 1
boy 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
your 1
deadliest 1
enemy 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
such 1
a 1
twoedged 1
thing 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
say 1
what 1
turn 1
things 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
kindly 1
sign 1
the 1
paper 1
where 1
mr 1
fordham 1
shows 1
you 1
i 1
signed 1
the 1
paper 1
as 1
directed 1
and 1
the 1
lawyer 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
singular 1
incident 1
made 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
the 1
deepest 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
pondered 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
every 1
way 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
without 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
anything 1
of 1
it 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
shake 1
off 1
the 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
dread 1
which 1
it 1
left 1
behind 1
though 1
the 1
sensation 1
grew 1
less 1
keen 1
as 1
the 1
weeks 1
passed 1
and 1
nothing 1
happened 1
to 1
disturb 1
the 1
usual 1
routine 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
change 1
in 1
my 1
uncle 1
however 1
he 1
drank 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
less 1
inclined 1
for 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
society 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
he 1
would 1
spend 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
the 1
door 1
locked 1
upon 1
the 1
inside 1
but 1
sometimes 1
he 1
would 1
emerge 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
drunken 1
frenzy 1
and 1
would 1
burst 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
tear 1
about 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
a 1
revolver 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
screaming 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
no 1
man 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
cooped 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
sheep 1
in 1
a 1
pen 1
by 1
man 1
or 1
devil 1
when 1
these 1
hot 1
fits 1
were 1
over 1
however 1
he 1
would 1
rush 1
tumultuously 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
lock 1
and 1
bar 1
it 1
behind 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
brazen 1
it 1
out 1
no 1
longer 1
against 1
the 1
terror 1
which 1
lies 1
at 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
at 1
such 1
times 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
his 1
face 1
even 1
on 1
a 1
cold 1
day 1
glisten 1
with 1
moisture 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
new 1
raised 1
from 1
a 1
basin 1
well 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
abuse 1
your 1
patience 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
night 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
drunken 1
sallies 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
we 1
found 1
him 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
face 1
downward 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
greenscummed 1
pool 1
which 1
lay 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
but 1
two 1
feet 1
deep 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
jury 1
having 1
regard 1
to 1
his 1
known 1
eccentricity 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
suicide 1
but 1
i 1
who 1
knew 1
how 1
he 1
winced 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
thought 1
of 1
death 1
had 1
much 1
ado 1
to 1
persuade 1
myself 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
meet 1
it 1
the 1
matter 1
passed 1
however 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
into 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
estate 1
and 1
of 1
some 1
14000 1
pounds 1
which 1
lay 1
to 1
his 1
credit 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
one 1
moment 1
holmes 1
interposed 1
your 1
statement 1
is 1
i 1
foresee 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
remarkable 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
the 1
reception 1
by 1
your 1
uncle 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
his 1
supposed 1
suicide 1
the 1
letter 1
arrived 1
on 1
march 1
10 1
1883 1
his 1
death 1
was 1
seven 1
weeks 1
later 1
upon 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
may 1
2nd 1
thank 1
you 1
pray 1
proceed 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
took 1
over 1
the 1
horsham 1
property 1
he 1
at 1
my 1
request 1
made 1
a 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
attic 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
always 1
locked 1
up 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
there 1
although 1
its 1
contents 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
cover 1
was 1
a 1
paper 1
label 1
with 1
the 1
initials 1
of 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
repeated 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
letters 1
memoranda 1
receipts 1
and 1
a 1
register 1
written 1
beneath 1
these 1
we 1
presume 1
indicated 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
by 1
colonel 1
openshaw 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
of 1
much 1
importance 1
in 1
the 1
attic 1
save 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
scattered 1
papers 1
and 1
notebooks 1
bearing 1
upon 1
my 1
uncles 1
life 1
in 1
america 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
time 1
and 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
his 1
duty 1
well 1
and 1
had 1
borne 1
the 1
repute 1
of 1
a 1
brave 1
soldier 1
others 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
date 1
during 1
the 1
reconstruction 1
of 1
the 1
southern 1
states 1
and 1
were 1
mostly 1
concerned 1
with 1
politics 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
evidently 1
taken 1
a 1
strong 1
part 1
in 1
opposing 1
the 1
carpetbag 1
politicians 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
sent 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
north 1
well 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
84 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
came 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
horsham 1
and 1
all 1
went 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
possible 1
with 1
us 1
until 1
the 1
january 1
of 1
85 1
on 1
the 1
fourth 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
new 1
year 1
i 1
heard 1
my 1
father 1
give 1
a 1
sharp 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
breakfasttable 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
with 1
a 1
newly 1
opened 1
envelope 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
five 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
in 1
the 1
outstretched 1
palm 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
laughed 1
at 1
what 1
he 1
called 1
my 1
cockandbull 1
story 1
about 1
the 1
colonel 1
but 1
he 1
looked 1
very 1
scared 1
and 1
puzzled 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
himself 1
why 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
john 1
he 1
stammered 1
my 1
heart 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
lead 1
it 1
is 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
said 1
i 1
he 1
looked 1
inside 1
the 1
envelope 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
he 1
cried 1
here 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
letters 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
written 1
above 1
them 1
put 1
the 1
papers 1
on 1
the 1
sundial 1
i 1
read 1
peeping 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
what 1
papers 1
what 1
sundial 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
sundial 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
other 1
said 1
i 1
but 1
the 1
papers 1
must 1
be 1
those 1
that 1
are 1
destroyed 1
pooh 1
said 1
he 1
gripping 1
hard 1
at 1
his 1
courage 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
civilised 1
land 1
here 1
and 1
we 1
cant 1
have 1
tomfoolery 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
where 1
does 1
the 1
thing 1
come 1
from 1
from 1
dundee 1
i 1
answered 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
postmark 1
some 1
preposterous 1
practical 1
joke 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
sundials 1
and 1
papers 1
i 1
shall 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
such 1
nonsense 1
i 1
should 1
certainly 1
speak 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
i 1
said 1
and 1
be 1
laughed 1
at 1
for 1
my 1
pains 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
then 1
let 1
me 1
do 1
so 1
no 1
i 1
forbid 1
you 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
a 1
fuss 1
made 1
about 1
such 1
nonsense 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
argue 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
obstinate 1
man 1
i 1
went 1
about 1
however 1
with 1
a 1
heart 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
forebodings 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
my 1
father 1
went 1
from 1
home 1
to 1
visit 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
of 1
his 1
major 1
freebody 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
command 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
forts 1
upon 1
portsdown 1
hill 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
farther 1
from 1
danger 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
in 1
that 1
however 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
error 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
absence 1
i 1
received 1
a 1
telegram 1
from 1
the 1
major 1
imploring 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
fallen 1
over 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
deep 1
chalkpits 1
which 1
abound 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
was 1
lying 1
senseless 1
with 1
a 1
shattered 1
skull 1
i 1
hurried 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
passed 1
away 1
without 1
having 1
ever 1
recovered 1
his 1
consciousness 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
it 1
appears 1
been 1
returning 1
from 1
fareham 1
in 1
the 1
twilight 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
unknown 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
chalkpit 1
unfenced 1
the 1
jury 1
had 1
no 1
hesitation 1
in 1
bringing 1
in 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
death 1
from 1
accidental 1
causes 1
carefully 1
as 1
i 1
examined 1
every 1
fact 1
connected 1
with 1
his 1
death 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
find 1
anything 1
which 1
could 1
suggest 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
murder 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
violence 1
no 1
footmarks 1
no 1
robbery 1
no 1
record 1
of 1
strangers 1
having 1
been 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
roads 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
at 1
ease 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
wellnigh 1
certain 1
that 1
some 1
foul 1
plot 1
had 1
been 1
woven 1
round 1
him 1
in 1
this 1
sinister 1
way 1
i 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
inheritance 1
you 1
will 1
ask 1
me 1
why 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dispose 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
answer 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
well 1
convinced 1
that 1
our 1
troubles 1
were 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
dependent 1
upon 1
an 1
incident 1
in 1
my 1
uncles 1
life 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
pressing 1
in 1
one 1
house 1
as 1
in 1
another 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
january 1
85 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
father 1
met 1
his 1
end 1
and 1
two 1
years 1
and 1
eight 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
then 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
lived 1
happily 1
at 1
horsham 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
hope 1
that 1
this 1
curse 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
ended 1
with 1
the 1
last 1
generation 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
take 1
comfort 1
too 1
soon 1
however 1
yesterday 1
morning 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
shape 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
my 1
father 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
took 1
from 1
his 1
waistcoat 1
a 1
crumpled 1
envelope 1
and 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
shook 1
out 1
upon 1
it 1
five 1
little 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
envelope 1
he 1
continued 1
the 1
postmark 1
is 1
londoneastern 1
division 1
within 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
words 1
which 1
were 1
upon 1
my 1
fathers 1
last 1
message 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
the 1
papers 1
on 1
the 1
sundial 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
asked 1
holmes 1
nothing 1
nothing 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truthhe 1
sank 1
his 1
face 1
into 1
his 1
thin 1
white 1
handsi 1
have 1
felt 1
helpless 1
i 1
have 1
felt 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
poor 1
rabbits 1
when 1
the 1
snake 1
is 1
writhing 1
towards 1
it 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
some 1
resistless 1
inexorable 1
evil 1
which 1
no 1
foresight 1
and 1
no 1
precautions 1
can 1
guard 1
against 1
tut 1
tut 1
cried 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
you 1
must 1
act 1
man 1
or 1
you 1
are 1
lost 1
nothing 1
but 1
energy 1
can 1
save 1
you 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
despair 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
police 1
ah 1
but 1
they 1
listened 1
to 1
my 1
story 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
i 1
am 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
inspector 1
has 1
formed 1
the 1
opinion 1
that 1
the 1
letters 1
are 1
all 1
practical 1
jokes 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
my 1
relations 1
were 1
really 1
accidents 1
as 1
the 1
jury 1
stated 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
warnings 1
holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
clenched 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
incredible 1
imbecility 1
he 1
cried 1
they 1
have 1
however 1
allowed 1
me 1
a 1
policeman 1
who 1
may 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
me 1
has 1
he 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
tonight 1
no 1
his 1
orders 1
were 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
holmes 1
raved 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
today 1
that 1
i 1
spoke 1
to 1
major 1
prendergast 1
about 1
my 1
troubles 1
and 1
was 1
advised 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
two 1
days 1
since 1
you 1
had 1
the 1
letter 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
acted 1
before 1
this 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
further 1
evidence 1
i 1
suppose 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
placed 1
before 1
usno 1
suggestive 1
detail 1
which 1
might 1
help 1
us 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
said 1
john 1
openshaw 1
he 1
rummaged 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
pocket 1
and 1
drawing 1
out 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
discoloured 1
bluetinted 1
paper 1
he 1
laid 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
remembrance 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
uncle 1
burned 1
the 1
papers 1
i 1
observed 1
that 1
the 1
small 1
unburned 1
margins 1
which 1
lay 1
amid 1
the 1
ashes 1
were 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
colour 1
i 1
found 1
this 1
single 1
sheet 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
which 1
has 1
perhaps 1
fluttered 1
out 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
has 1
escaped 1
destruction 1
beyond 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
pips 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
that 1
it 1
helps 1
us 1
much 1
i 1
think 1
myself 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
page 1
from 1
some 1
private 1
diary 1
the 1
writing 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
my 1
uncles 1
holmes 1
moved 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
we 1
both 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
which 1
showed 1
by 1
its 1
ragged 1
edge 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
indeed 1
been 1
torn 1
from 1
a 1
book 1
it 1
was 1
headed 1
march 1
1869 1
and 1
beneath 1
were 1
the 1
following 1
enigmatical 1
notices 1
4th 1

all 1
well 1
thank 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
folding 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
returning 1
it 1
to 1
our 1
visitor 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
lose 1
another 1
instant 1
we 1
cannot 1
spare 1
time 1
even 1
to 1
discuss 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
must 1
get 1
home 1
instantly 1
and 1
act 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
at 1
once 1
you 1
must 1
put 1
this 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
shown 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
described 1
you 1
must 1
also 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
papers 1
were 1
burned 1
by 1
your 1
uncle 1
and 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
remains 1
you 1
must 1
assert 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
will 1

conviction 1
with 1

having 1
done 1
this 1
you 1
must 1
at 1
once 1
put 1
the 1
box 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
sundial 1
as 1
directed 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
entirely 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
revenge 1
or 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
at 1
present 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
gain 1
that 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
web 1
to 1
weave 1
while 1
theirs 1
is 1
already 1
woven 1
the 1
first 1
consideration 1
is 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
pressing 1
danger 1
which 1
threatens 1
you 1
the 1
second 1
is 1
to 1
clear 1
up 1
the 1
mystery 1

to 1
punish 1
the 1
guilty 1
parties 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
rising 1
and 1
pulling 1
on 1
his 1
overcoat 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
fresh 1
life 1
and 1
hope 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
advise 1
do 1
not 1
lose 1
an 1
instant 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
for 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
a 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
threatened 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
real 1
and 1
imminent 1
danger 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
go 1
back 1
by 1
train 1
from 1
waterloo 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
nine 1
the 1
streets 1
will 1
be 1
crowded 1
so 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
in 1
safety 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
cannot 1
guard 1
yourself 1
too 1
closely 1
i 1
am 1
armed 1
that 1
is 1
well 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
shall 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
upon 1
your 1
case 1
i 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
at 1
horsham 1
then 1
no 1
your 1
secret 1
lies 1
in 1
london 1
it 1
is 1
there 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
seek 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
with 1
news 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
the 1
papers 1
i 1
shall 1
take 1
your 1
advice 1
in 1
every 1
particular 1
he 1
shook 1
hands 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
leave 1
outside 1
the 1
wind 1
still 1
screamed 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
splashed 1
and 1
pattered 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
this 1
strange 1
wild 1
story 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
mad 1
elementsblown 1
in 1
upon 1
us 1
like 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
seaweed 1
in 1
a 1

sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
silence 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
forward 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
bent 1
upon 1
the 1
red 1
glow 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
then 1
he 1
lit 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
he 1
watched 1
the 1
blue 1
smokerings 1
as 1
they 1
chased 1
each 1
other 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
he 1
remarked 1
at 1
last 1
that 1
of 1
all 1
our 1
cases 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
none 1
more 1
fantastic 1
than 1
this 1
save 1
perhaps 1
the 1
sign 1
of 1
four 1
well 1
yes 1
save 1
perhaps 1
that 1
and 1
yet 1
this 1
john 1
openshaw 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
walking 1
amid 1
even 1
greater 1
perils 1
than 1
did 1
the 1
sholtos 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
i 1
asked 1
formed 1
any 1
definite 1
conception 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
these 1
perils 1
are 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
nature 1
he 1
answered 1
then 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
who 1
is 1
this 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
and 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
pursue 1
this 1
unhappy 1
family 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
placed 1
his 1
elbows 1
upon 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
fingertips 1
together 1
the 1
ideal 1
reasoner 1
he 1
remarked 1
would 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
shown 1
a 1
single 1
fact 1
in 1
all 1
its 1
bearings 1
deduce 1
from 1
it 1
not 1
only 1
all 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
which 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
also 1
all 1
the 1
results 1
which 1
would 1
follow 1
from 1
it 1
as 1
cuvier 1
could 1
correctly 1
describe 1
a 1
whole 1
animal 1
by 1
the 1
contemplation 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
bone 1
so 1
the 1
observer 1
who 1
has 1
thoroughly 1
understood 1
one 1
link 1
in 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
incidents 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
accurately 1
state 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
ones 1
both 1
before 1
and 1
after 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
grasped 1
the 1
results 1
which 1
the 1
reason 1
alone 1
can 1
attain 1
to 1
problems 1
may 1
be 1
solved 1
in 1
the 1
study 1
which 1
have 1
baffled 1
all 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
sought 1
a 1
solution 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
their 1
senses 1
to 1
carry 1
the 1
art 1
however 1
to 1
its 1
highest 1
pitch 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
that 1
the 1
reasoner 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
utilise 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
knowledge 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
implies 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
readily 1
see 1
a 1
possession 1
of 1
all 1
knowledge 1
which 1
even 1
in 1
these 1
days 1
of 1
free 1
education 1
and 1
encyclopaedias 1
is 1
a 1
somewhat 1
rare 1
accomplishment 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
impossible 1
however 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
possess 1
all 1
knowledge 1
which 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
this 1
i 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
in 1
my 1
case 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
rightly 1
you 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
our 1
friendship 1
defined 1
my 1
limits 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
precise 1
fashion 1
yes 1
i 1
answered 1
laughing 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
document 1
philosophy 1
astronomy 1
and 1

those 1
i 1
think 1
were 1
the 1
main 1
points 1
of 1
my 1
analysis 1
holmes 1
grinned 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
item 1
well 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
say 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
then 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
keep 1
his 1
little 1
brainattic 1
stocked 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
use 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
he 1
can 1
put 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
lumberroom 1
of 1
his 1
library 1
where 1
he 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
wants 1
it 1
now 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
submitted 1
to 1
us 1
tonight 1
we 1
need 1
certainly 1
to 1
muster 1
all 1
our 1
resources 1
kindly 1
hand 1
me 1
down 1
the 1
letter 1
k 1
of 1
the 1
american 1
encyclopaedia 1
which 1
stands 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
beside 1
you 1
thank 1
you 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
consider 1
the 1
situation 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
may 1
be 1
deduced 1
from 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
we 1
may 1
start 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
presumption 1
that 1
colonel 1
openshaw 1
had 1
some 1
very 1
strong 1
reason 1
for 1
leaving 1
america 1
men 1
at 1
his 1
time 1
of 1
life 1
do 1
not 1
change 1
all 1
their 1
habits 1
and 1
exchange 1
willingly 1
the 1
charming 1
climate 1
of 1
florida 1
for 1
the 1
lonely 1
life 1
of 1
an 1
english 1
provincial 1
town 1
his 1
extreme 1
love 1
of 1
solitude 1
in 1
england 1
suggests 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
fear 1
of 1
someone 1
or 1
something 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
assume 1
as 1
a 1
working 1
hypothesis 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
fear 1
of 1
someone 1
or 1
something 1
which 1
drove 1
him 1
from 1
america 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
feared 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
deduce 1
that 1
by 1
considering 1
the 1
formidable 1
letters 1
which 1
were 1
received 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
successors 1
did 1
you 1
remark 1
the 1
postmarks 1
of 1
those 1
letters 1
the 1
first 1
was 1
from 1
pondicherry 1
the 1
second 1
from 1
dundee 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
from 1
london 1
from 1
east 1
london 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
from 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
seaports 1
that 1
the 1
writer 1
was 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
excellent 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
a 1
clue 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
probabilitythe 1
strong 1
probabilityis 1
that 1
the 1
writer 1
was 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
consider 1
another 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
pondicherry 1
seven 1
weeks 1
elapsed 1
between 1
the 1
threat 1
and 1
its 1
fulfilment 1
in 1
dundee 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
some 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
days 1
does 1
that 1
suggest 1
anything 1
a 1
greater 1
distance 1
to 1
travel 1
but 1
the 1
letter 1
had 1
also 1
a 1
greater 1
distance 1
to 1
come 1
then 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
point 1
there 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
presumption 1
that 1
the 1
vessel 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
man 1
or 1
men 1
are 1
is 1
a 1
sailingship 1
it 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
always 1
send 1
their 1
singular 1
warning 1
or 1
token 1
before 1
them 1
when 1
starting 1
upon 1
their 1
mission 1
you 1
see 1
how 1
quickly 1
the 1
deed 1
followed 1
the 1
sign 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
dundee 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
from 1
pondicherry 1
in 1
a 1
steamer 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
arrived 1
almost 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
their 1
letter 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
seven 1
weeks 1
elapsed 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
those 1
seven 1
weeks 1
represented 1
the 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
mailboat 1
which 1
brought 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
sailing 1
vessel 1
which 1
brought 1
the 1
writer 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
deadly 1
urgency 1
of 1
this 1
new 1
case 1
and 1
why 1
i 1
urged 1
young 1
openshaw 1
to 1
caution 1
the 1
blow 1
has 1
always 1
fallen 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
which 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
senders 1
to 1
travel 1
the 1
distance 1
but 1
this 1
one 1
comes 1
from 1
london 1
and 1
therefore 1
we 1
cannot 1
count 1
upon 1
delay 1
good 1
god 1
i 1
cried 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
mean 1
this 1
relentless 1
persecution 1
the 1
papers 1
which 1
openshaw 1
carried 1
are 1
obviously 1
of 1
vital 1
importance 1
to 1
the 1
person 1
or 1
persons 1
in 1
the 1
sailingship 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
carried 1
out 1
two 1
deaths 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
way 1
as 1
to 1
deceive 1
a 1
coroners 1
jury 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
several 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
men 1
of 1
resource 1
and 1
determination 1
their 1
papers 1
they 1
mean 1
to 1
have 1
be 1
the 1
holder 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
it 1
may 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
you 1
see 1
k 1
k 1
k 1
ceases 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
initials 1
of 1
an 1
individual 1
and 1
becomes 1
the 1
badge 1
of 1
a 1
society 1
but 1
of 1
what 1
society 1
have 1
you 1
never 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
bending 1
forward 1
and 1
sinking 1
his 1
voicehave 1
you 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
ku 1
klux 1
klan 1
i 1
never 1
have 1
holmes 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
here 1
it 1
is 1

presently 1
ku 1
klux 1
klan 1
a 1
name 1
derived 1
from 1
the 1
fanciful 1
resemblance 1
to 1
the 1
sound 1
produced 1
by 1
cocking 1
a 1
rifle 1
this 1
terrible 1
secret 1
society 1
was 1
formed 1
by 1
some 1
exconfederate 1
soldiers 1
in 1
the 1
southern 1
states 1
after 1
the 1
civil 1
war 1
and 1
it 1
rapidly 1
formed 1
local 1
branches 1
in 1
different 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
notably 1
in 1
tennessee 1
louisiana 1
the 1
carolinas 1
georgia 1
and 1
florida 1
its 1
power 1
was 1
used 1
for 1
political 1
purposes 1
principally 1
for 1
the 1
terrorising 1
of 1
the 1
negro 1
voters 1
and 1
the 1
murdering 1
and 1
driving 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
opposed 1
to 1
its 1
views 1
its 1
outrages 1
were 1
usually 1
preceded 1
by 1
a 1
warning 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
marked 1
man 1
in 1
some 1
fantastic 1
but 1
generally 1
recognised 1

some 1
parts 1
melon 1

or 1
orange 1
pips 1
in 1
others 1
on 1
receiving 1
this 1
the 1
victim 1
might 1
either 1
openly 1
abjure 1
his 1
former 1
ways 1
or 1
might 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
if 1
he 1
braved 1
the 1
matter 1
out 1
death 1
would 1
unfailingly 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
usually 1
in 1
some 1
strange 1
and 1
unforeseen 1
manner 1
so 1
perfect 1
was 1
the 1
organisation 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
and 1
so 1
systematic 1
its 1
methods 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
case 1
upon 1
record 1
where 1
any 1
man 1
succeeded 1
in 1
braving 1
it 1
with 1
impunity 1
or 1
in 1
which 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
outrages 1
were 1
traced 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
perpetrators 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
the 1
organisation 1
flourished 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
efforts 1
of 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
government 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
better 1
classes 1
of 1
the 1
community 1
in 1
the 1
south 1
eventually 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
1869 1
the 1
movement 1
rather 1
suddenly 1
collapsed 1
although 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
sporadic 1
outbreaks 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
sort 1
since 1
that 1
date 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
said 1
holmes 1
laying 1
down 1
the 1
volume 1
that 1
the 1
sudden 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
was 1
coincident 1
with 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
openshaw 1
from 1
america 1
with 1
their 1
papers 1
it 1
may 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
cause 1
and 1
effect 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
have 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
more 1
implacable 1
spirits 1
upon 1
their 1
track 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
this 1
register 1
and 1
diary 1
may 1
implicate 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
south 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
many 1
who 1
will 1
not 1
sleep 1
easy 1
at 1
night 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
recovered 1
then 1
the 1
page 1
we 1
have 1
seen 1
is 1
such 1
as 1
we 1
might 1
expect 1
it 1
ran 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right 1
sent 1
the 1
pips 1
to 1
a 1
b 1
and 1
cthat 1
is 1
sent 1
the 1
societys 1
warning 1
to 1
them 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
successive 1
entries 1
that 1
a 1
and 1
b 1
cleared 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
finally 1
that 1
c 1
was 1
visited 1
with 1
i 1
fear 1
a 1
sinister 1
result 1
for 1
c 1
well 1
i 1
think 1
doctor 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
let 1
some 1
light 1
into 1
this 1
dark 1
place 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
chance 1
young 1
openshaw 1
has 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
is 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
him 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
or 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
tonight 1
so 1
hand 1
me 1
over 1
my 1
violin 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
to 1
forget 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
miserable 1
weather 1
and 1
the 1
still 1
more 1
miserable 1
ways 1
of 1
our 1
fellowmen 1
it 1
had 1
cleared 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
with 1
a 1
subdued 1
brightness 1
through 1
the 1
dim 1
veil 1
which 1
hangs 1
over 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
already 1
at 1
breakfast 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
not 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
i 1
foresee 1
a 1
very 1
busy 1
day 1
before 1
me 1
in 1
looking 1
into 1
this 1
case 1
of 1
young 1
openshaws 1
what 1
steps 1
will 1
you 1
take 1
i 1
asked 1
it 1
will 1
very 1
much 1
depend 1
upon 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
inquiries 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
horsham 1
after 1
all 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
first 1
no 1
i 1
shall 1
commence 1
with 1
the 1
city 1
just 1
ring 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
will 1
bring 1
up 1
your 1
coffee 1
as 1
i 1
waited 1
i 1
lifted 1
the 1
unopened 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
glanced 1
my 1
eye 1
over 1
it 1
it 1
rested 1
upon 1
a 1
heading 1
which 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
holmes 1
i 1
cried 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
late 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
laying 1
down 1
his 1
cup 1
i 1
feared 1
as 1
much 1
how 1
was 1
it 1
done 1
he 1
spoke 1
calmly 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
moved 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
openshaw 1
and 1
the 1
heading 1
tragedy 1
near 1
waterloo 1
bridge 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
account 1
between 1
nine 1
and 1
ten 1
last 1
night 1
policeconstable 1
cook 1
of 1
the 1
h 1
division 1
on 1
duty 1
near 1
waterloo 1
bridge 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
a 1
splash 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
night 1
however 1
was 1
extremely 1
dark 1
and 1
stormy 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
several 1
passersby 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
impossible 1
to 1
effect 1
a 1
rescue 1
the 1
alarm 1
however 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
waterpolice 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
eventually 1
recovered 1
it 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
name 1
as 1
it 1
appears 1
from 1
an 1
envelope 1
which 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
was 1
john 1
openshaw 1
and 1
whose 1
residence 1
is 1
near 1
horsham 1
it 1
is 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
hurrying 1
down 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
from 1
waterloo 1
station 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
haste 1
and 1
the 1
extreme 1
darkness 1
he 1
missed 1
his 1
path 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
landingplaces 1
for 1
river 1
steamboats 1
the 1
body 1
exhibited 1
no 1
traces 1
of 1
violence 1
and 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
deceased 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
which 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
calling 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
the 1
authorities 1
to 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
riverside 1
landingstages 1
we 1
sat 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
holmes 1
more 1
depressed 1
and 1
shaken 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
him 1
that 1
hurts 1
my 1
pride 1
watson 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
petty 1
feeling 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
it 1
hurts 1
my 1
pride 1
it 1
becomes 1
a 1
personal 1
matter 1
with 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
if 1
god 1
sends 1
me 1
health 1
i 1
shall 1
set 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
this 1
gang 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
death 1
he 1
sprang 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
paced 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
uncontrollable 1
agitation 1
with 1
a 1
flush 1
upon 1
his 1
sallow 1
cheeks 1
and 1
a 1
nervous 1
clasping 1
and 1
unclasping 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
hands 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
cunning 1
devils 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
at 1
last 1
how 1
could 1
they 1
have 1
decoyed 1
him 1
down 1
there 1
the 1
embankment 1
is 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
direct 1
line 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
the 1
bridge 1
no 1
doubt 1
was 1
too 1
crowded 1
even 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
night 1
for 1
their 1
purpose 1
well 1
watson 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
who 1
will 1
win 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
out 1
now 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
no 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
own 1
police 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
spun 1
the 1
web 1
they 1
may 1
take 1
the 1
flies 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
all 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
my 1
professional 1
work 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
i 1
returned 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
ten 1
oclock 1
before 1
he 1
entered 1
looking 1
pale 1
and 1
worn 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
tearing 1
a 1
piece 1
from 1
the 1
loaf 1
he 1
devoured 1
it 1
voraciously 1
washing 1
it 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
draught 1
of 1
water 1
you 1
are 1
hungry 1
i 1
remarked 1
starving 1
it 1
had 1
escaped 1
my 1
memory 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
nothing 1
since 1
breakfast 1
nothing 1
not 1
a 1
bite 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
have 1
you 1
succeeded 1
well 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
clue 1
i 1
have 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
young 1
openshaw 1
shall 1
not 1
long 1
remain 1
unavenged 1
why 1
watson 1
let 1
us 1
put 1
their 1
own 1
devilish 1
trademark 1
upon 1
them 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
he 1
took 1
an 1
orange 1
from 1
the 1
cupboard 1
and 1
tearing 1
it 1
to 1
pieces 1
he 1
squeezed 1
out 1
the 1
pips 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
of 1
these 1
he 1
took 1
five 1
and 1
thrust 1
them 1
into 1
an 1
envelope 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
flap 1
he 1
wrote 1
s 1
h 1
for 1
j 1
o 1
then 1
he 1
sealed 1
it 1
and 1
addressed 1
it 1
to 1
captain 1
james 1
calhoun 1
barque 1
lone 1
star 1
savannah 1
georgia 1
that 1
will 1
await 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
enters 1
port 1
said 1
he 1
chuckling 1
it 1
may 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
sleepless 1
night 1
he 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
as 1
sure 1
a 1
precursor 1
of 1
his 1
fate 1
as 1
openshaw 1
did 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
who 1
is 1
this 1
captain 1
calhoun 1
the 1
leader 1
of 1
the 1
gang 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
others 1
but 1
he 1
first 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
trace 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
all 1
covered 1
with 1
dates 1
and 1
names 1
i 1
have 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
said 1
he 1
over 1
lloyds 1
registers 1
and 1
files 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
papers 1
following 1
the 1
future 1
career 1
of 1
every 1
vessel 1
which 1
touched 1
at 1
pondicherry 1
in 1
january 1
and 1
february 1
in 1
83 1
there 1
were 1
thirtysix 1
ships 1
of 1
fair 1
tonnage 1
which 1
were 1
reported 1
there 1
during 1
those 1
months 1
of 1
these 1
one 1
the 1
lone 1
star 1
instantly 1
attracted 1
my 1
attention 1
since 1
although 1
it 1
was 1
reported 1
as 1
having 1
cleared 1
from 1
london 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
given 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
states 1
of 1
the 1
union 1
texas 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
and 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
which 1
but 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
must 1
have 1
an 1
american 1
origin 1
what 1
then 1
i 1
searched 1
the 1
dundee 1
records 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
barque 1
lone 1
star 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
january 1
85 1
my 1
suspicion 1
became 1
a 1
certainty 1
i 1
then 1
inquired 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
vessels 1
which 1
lay 1
at 1
present 1
in 1
the 1
port 1
of 1
london 1
yes 1
the 1
lone 1
star 1
had 1
arrived 1
here 1
last 1
week 1
i 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
albert 1
dock 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
by 1
the 1
early 1
tide 1
this 1
morning 1
homeward 1
bound 1
to 1
savannah 1
i 1
wired 1
to 1
gravesend 1
and 1
learned 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
some 1
time 1
ago 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
is 1
easterly 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
past 1
the 1
goodwins 1
and 1
not 1
very 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
isle 1
of 1
wight 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
oh 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
him 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
mates 1
are 1
as 1
i 1
learn 1
the 1
only 1
nativeborn 1
americans 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
the 1
others 1
are 1
finns 1
and 1
germans 1
i 1
know 1
also 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
three 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
ship 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
had 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
stevedore 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
loading 1
their 1
cargo 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
their 1
sailingship 1
reaches 1
savannah 1
the 1
mailboat 1
will 1
have 1
carried 1
this 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
cable 1
will 1
have 1
informed 1
the 1
police 1
of 1
savannah 1
that 1
these 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
badly 1
wanted 1
here 1
upon 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
there 1
is 1
ever 1
a 1
flaw 1
however 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
laid 1
of 1
human 1
plans 1
and 1
the 1
murderers 1
of 1
john 1
openshaw 1
were 1
never 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
orange 1
pips 1
which 1
would 1
show 1
them 1
that 1
another 1
as 1
cunning 1
and 1
as 1
resolute 1
as 1
themselves 1
was 1
upon 1
their 1
track 1
very 1
long 1
and 1
very 1
severe 1
were 1
the 1
equinoctial 1
gales 1
that 1
year 1
we 1
waited 1
long 1
for 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
lone 1
star 1
of 1
savannah 1
but 1
none 1
ever 1
reached 1
us 1
we 1
did 1
at 1
last 1
hear 1
that 1
somewhere 1
far 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
atlantic 1
a 1
shattered 1
sternpost 1
of 1
a 1
boat 1
was 1
seen 1
swinging 1
in 1
the 1
trough 1
of 1
a 1
wave 1
with 1
the 1
letters 1
l 1
s 1
carved 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
which 1
we 1
shall 1
ever 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1

adventure 1
vi 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
isa 1
whitney 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
late 1
elias 1
whitney 1
dd 1
principal 1
of 1
the 1
theological 1
college 1
of 1
st 1
georges 1
was 1
much 1
addicted 1
to 1
opium 1
the 1
habit 1
grew 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
from 1
some 1
foolish 1
freak 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
college 1
for 1
having 1
read 1
de 1
quinceys 1
description 1
of 1
his 1
dreams 1
and 1
sensations 1
he 1
had 1
drenched 1
his 1
tobacco 1
with 1
laudanum 1
in 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
produce 1
the 1
same 1
effects 1
he 1
found 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
more 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
the 1
practice 1
is 1
easier 1
to 1
attain 1
than 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
and 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
he 1
continued 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
the 1
drug 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
mingled 1
horror 1
and 1
pity 1
to 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
relatives 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
with 1
yellow 1
pasty 1
face 1
drooping 1
lids 1
and 1
pinpoint 1
pupils 1
all 1
huddled 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
ruin 1
of 1
a 1
noble 1
man 1
one 1
nightit 1
was 1
in 1
june 1
89there 1
came 1
a 1
ring 1
to 1
my 1
bell 1
about 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
gives 1
his 1
first 1
yawn 1
and 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
i 1
sat 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
chair 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
laid 1
her 1
needlework 1
down 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
face 1
of 1
disappointment 1
a 1
patient 1
said 1
she 1
youll 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
i 1
groaned 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
newly 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
a 1
weary 1
day 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
a 1
few 1
hurried 1
words 1
and 1
then 1
quick 1
steps 1
upon 1
the 1
linoleum 1
our 1
own 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
lady 1
clad 1
in 1
some 1
darkcoloured 1
stuff 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
veil 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
calling 1
so 1
late 1
she 1
began 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
losing 1
her 1
selfcontrol 1
she 1
ran 1
forward 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
about 1
my 1
wifes 1
neck 1
and 1
sobbed 1
upon 1
her 1
shoulder 1
oh 1
im 1
in 1
such 1
trouble 1
she 1
cried 1
i 1
do 1
so 1
want 1
a 1
little 1
help 1
why 1
said 1
my 1
wife 1
pulling 1
up 1
her 1
veil 1
it 1
is 1
kate 1
whitney 1
how 1
you 1
startled 1
me 1
kate 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
an 1
idea 1
who 1
you 1
were 1
when 1
you 1
came 1
in 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
i 1
came 1
straight 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
way 1
folk 1
who 1
were 1
in 1
grief 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
like 1
birds 1
to 1
a 1
lighthouse 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
sweet 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
wine 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
sit 1
here 1
comfortably 1
and 1
tell 1
us 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
or 1
should 1
you 1
rather 1
that 1
i 1
sent 1
james 1
off 1
to 1
bed 1
oh 1
no 1
no 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
doctors 1
advice 1
and 1
help 1
too 1
its 1
about 1
isa 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
home 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
frightened 1
about 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
spoken 1
to 1
us 1
of 1
her 1
husbands 1
trouble 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
doctor 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
as 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
and 1
school 1
companion 1
we 1
soothed 1
and 1
comforted 1
her 1
by 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
find 1
did 1
she 1
know 1
where 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
surest 1
information 1
that 1
of 1
late 1
he 1
had 1
when 1
the 1
fit 1
was 1
on 1
him 1
made 1
use 1
of 1
an 1
opium 1
den 1
in 1
the 1
farthest 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
hitherto 1
his 1
orgies 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
confined 1
to 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
twitching 1
and 1
shattered 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
but 1
now 1
the 1
spell 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
him 1
eightandforty 1
hours 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
doubtless 1
among 1
the 1
dregs 1
of 1
the 1
docks 1
breathing 1
in 1
the 1
poison 1
or 1
sleeping 1
off 1
the 1
effects 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
she 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
upper 1
swandam 1
lane 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
she 1
to 1
do 1
how 1
could 1
she 1
a 1
young 1
and 1
timid 1
woman 1
make 1
her 1
way 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
pluck 1
her 1
husband 1
out 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
ruffians 1
who 1
surrounded 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
might 1
i 1
not 1
escort 1
her 1
to 1
this 1
place 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
a 1
second 1
thought 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
come 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
was 1
isa 1
whitneys 1
medical 1
adviser 1
and 1
as 1
such 1
i 1
had 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
i 1
could 1
manage 1
it 1
better 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
alone 1
i 1
promised 1
her 1
on 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
send 1
him 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
within 1
two 1
hours 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
indeed 1
at 1
the 1
address 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
and 1
so 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
my 1
armchair 1
and 1
cheery 1
sittingroom 1
behind 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
speeding 1
eastward 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
on 1
a 1
strange 1
errand 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
though 1
the 1
future 1
only 1
could 1
show 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
great 1
difficulty 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
stage 1
of 1
my 1
adventure 1
upper 1
swandam 1
lane 1
is 1
a 1
vile 1
alley 1
lurking 1
behind 1
the 1
high 1
wharves 1
which 1
line 1
the 1
north 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
london 1
bridge 1
between 1
a 1
slopshop 1
and 1
a 1
ginshop 1
approached 1
by 1
a 1
steep 1
flight 1
of 1
steps 1
leading 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
black 1
gap 1
like 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
cave 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
den 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
search 1
ordering 1
my 1
cab 1
to 1
wait 1
i 1
passed 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
worn 1
hollow 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
by 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
tread 1
of 1
drunken 1
feet 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
flickering 1
oillamp 1
above 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
latch 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
into 1
a 1
long 1
low 1
room 1
thick 1
and 1
heavy 1
with 1
the 1
brown 1
opium 1
smoke 1
and 1
terraced 1
with 1
wooden 1
berths 1
like 1
the 1
forecastle 1
of 1
an 1
emigrant 1
ship 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
one 1
could 1
dimly 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
bodies 1
lying 1
in 1
strange 1
fantastic 1
poses 1
bowed 1
shoulders 1
bent 1
knees 1
heads 1
thrown 1
back 1
and 1
chins 1
pointing 1
upward 1
with 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
dark 1
lacklustre 1
eye 1
turned 1
upon 1
the 1
newcomer 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
shadows 1
there 1
glimmered 1
little 1
red 1
circles 1
of 1
light 1
now 1
bright 1
now 1
faint 1
as 1
the 1
burning 1
poison 1
waxed 1
or 1
waned 1
in 1
the 1
bowls 1
of 1
the 1
metal 1
pipes 1
the 1
most 1
lay 1
silent 1
but 1
some 1
muttered 1
to 1
themselves 1
and 1
others 1
talked 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
low 1
monotonous 1
voice 1
their 1
conversation 1
coming 1
in 1
gushes 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
tailing 1
off 1
into 1
silence 1
each 1
mumbling 1
out 1
his 1
own 1
thoughts 1
and 1
paying 1
little 1
heed 1
to 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
his 1
neighbour 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
brazier 1
of 1
burning 1
charcoal 1
beside 1
which 1
on 1
a 1
threelegged 1
wooden 1
stool 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
tall 1
thin 1
old 1
man 1
with 1
his 1
jaw 1
resting 1
upon 1
his 1
two 1
fists 1
and 1
his 1
elbows 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
staring 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
as 1
i 1
entered 1
a 1
sallow 1
malay 1
attendant 1
had 1
hurried 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
pipe 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
a 1
supply 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
beckoning 1
me 1
to 1
an 1
empty 1
berth 1
thank 1

i 1
have 1
not 1
come 1
to 1

whitney 1
and 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1

with 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
movement 1
and 1
an 1
exclamation 1
from 1
my 1
right 1
and 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
i 1
saw 1
whitney 1
pale 1
haggard 1
and 1
unkempt 1
staring 1
out 1
at 1
me 1
my 1
god 1
its 1

his 1
face 1
onto 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sob 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
treble 1
key 1

all 1
off 1

i 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
for 1
myself 1
i 1
walked 1
down 1
the 1
narrow 1
passage 1
between 1
the 1
double 1
row 1
of 1
sleepers 1
holding 1
my 1
breath 1
to 1
keep 1
out 1
the 1
vile 1
stupefying 1
fumes 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
and 1
looking 1
about 1
for 1
the 1
manager 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
tall 1
man 1
who 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
brazier 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
sudden 1
pluck 1
at 1
my 1
skirt 1
and 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
whispered 1
walk 1
past 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
look 1
back 1
at 1
me 1
the 1
words 1
fell 1
quite 1
distinctly 1
upon 1
my 1
ear 1
i 1
glanced 1
down 1
they 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
sat 1
now 1
as 1
absorbed 1
as 1
ever 1
very 1
thin 1
very 1
wrinkled 1
bent 1
with 1
age 1
an 1
opium 1
pipe 1
dangling 1
down 1
from 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
dropped 1
in 1
sheer 1
lassitude 1
from 1
his 1
fingers 1
i 1
took 1
two 1
steps 1
forward 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
it 1
took 1
all 1
my 1
selfcontrol 1
to 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
breaking 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
astonishment 1
he 1
had 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
so 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
his 1
form 1
had 1
filled 1
out 1
his 1
wrinkles 1
were 1
gone 1
the 1
dull 1
eyes 1
had 1
regained 1
their 1
fire 1
and 1
there 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
grinning 1
at 1
my 1
surprise 1
was 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
slight 1
motion 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
approach 1
him 1
and 1
instantly 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
half 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
company 1
once 1
more 1
subsided 1
into 1
a 1
doddering 1
looselipped 1
senility 1
holmes 1
i 1
whispered 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
in 1
this 1
den 1
as 1
low 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
have 1
excellent 1
ears 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
kindness 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
that 1
sottish 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
exceedingly 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
talk 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
cab 1
outside 1
then 1
pray 1
send 1
him 1
home 1
in 1
it 1
you 1
may 1
safely 1
trust 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
limp 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
any 1
mischief 1
i 1
should 1
recommend 1
you 1
also 1
to 1
send 1
a 1
note 1
by 1
the 1
cabman 1
to 1
your 1
wife 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
thrown 1
in 1
your 1
lot 1
with 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
wait 1
outside 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
refuse 1
any 1
of 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
requests 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
always 1
so 1
exceedingly 1
definite 1
and 1
put 1
forward 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
quiet 1
air 1
of 1
mastery 1
i 1
felt 1
however 1
that 1
when 1
whitney 1
was 1
once 1
confined 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
my 1
mission 1
was 1
practically 1
accomplished 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
wish 1
anything 1
better 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
associated 1
with 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
singular 1
adventures 1
which 1
were 1
the 1
normal 1
condition 1
of 1
his 1
existence 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
i 1
had 1
written 1
my 1
note 1
paid 1
whitneys 1
bill 1
led 1
him 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
seen 1
him 1
driven 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
a 1
decrepit 1
figure 1
had 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
walking 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
for 1
two 1
streets 1
he 1
shuffled 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
bent 1
back 1
and 1
an 1
uncertain 1
foot 1
then 1
glancing 1
quickly 1
round 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
out 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
hearty 1
fit 1
of 1
laughter 1
i 1
suppose 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
added 1
opiumsmoking 1
to 1
cocaine 1
injections 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
little 1
weaknesses 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
favoured 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
medical 1
views 1
i 1
was 1
certainly 1
surprised 1
to 1
find 1
you 1
there 1
but 1
not 1
more 1
so 1
than 1
i 1
to 1
find 1
you 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
to 1
find 1
an 1
enemy 1
an 1
enemy 1
yes 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
natural 1
enemies 1
or 1
shall 1
i 1
say 1
my 1
natural 1
prey 1
briefly 1
watson 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
remarkable 1
inquiry 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
hoped 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
clue 1
in 1
the 1
incoherent 1
ramblings 1
of 1
these 1
sots 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
before 1
now 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
recognised 1
in 1
that 1
den 1
my 1
life 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
worth 1
an 1
hours 1
purchase 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
used 1
it 1
before 1
now 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
purposes 1
and 1
the 1
rascally 1
lascar 1
who 1
runs 1
it 1
has 1
sworn 1
to 1
have 1
vengeance 1
upon 1
me 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
trapdoor 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
that 1
building 1
near 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
pauls 1
wharf 1
which 1
could 1
tell 1
some 1
strange 1
tales 1
of 1
what 1
has 1
passed 1
through 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
moonless 1
nights 1
what 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
bodies 1
ay 1
bodies 1
watson 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
rich 1
men 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
1000 1
pounds 1
for 1
every 1
poor 1
devil 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
that 1
den 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
vilest 1
murdertrap 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
riverside 1
and 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
has 1
entered 1
it 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
more 1
but 1
our 1
trap 1
should 1
be 1
here 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
two 1
forefingers 1
between 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
whistled 1
shrillya 1
signal 1
which 1
was 1
answered 1
by 1
a 1
similar 1
whistle 1
from 1
the 1
distance 1
followed 1
shortly 1
by 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
wheels 1
and 1
the 1
clink 1
of 1
horses 1
hoofs 1
now 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
a 1
tall 1
dogcart 1
dashed 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
throwing 1
out 1
two 1
golden 1
tunnels 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
from 1
its 1
side 1
lanterns 1

come 1

chronicler 1
still 1
more 1
so 1

then 1
near 1

in 1

we 1
have 1
a 1
sevenmile 1
drive 1
before 1

but 1
i 1
am 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
of 1
course 1

her 1
head 1
so 1
long 1
then 1
he 1
flicked 1
the 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
we 1
dashed 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
endless 1
succession 1
of 1
sombre 1
and 1
deserted 1
streets 1
which 1
widened 1
gradually 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
flying 1
across 1
a 1
broad 1
balustraded 1
bridge 1
with 1
the 1
murky 1
river 1
flowing 1
sluggishly 1
beneath 1
us 1
beyond 1
lay 1
another 1
dull 1
wilderness 1
of 1
bricks 1
and 1
mortar 1
its 1
silence 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
heavy 1
regular 1
footfall 1
of 1
the 1
policeman 1
or 1
the 1
songs 1
and 1
shouts 1
of 1
some 1
belated 1
party 1
of 1
revellers 1
a 1
dull 1
wrack 1
was 1
drifting 1
slowly 1
across 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
a 1
star 1
or 1
two 1
twinkled 1
dimly 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
through 1
the 1
rifts 1
of 1
the 1
clouds 1
holmes 1
drove 1
in 1
silence 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
lost 1
in 1
thought 1
while 1
i 1
sat 1
beside 1
him 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
this 1
new 1
quest 1
might 1
be 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
tax 1
his 1
powers 1
so 1
sorely 1
and 1
yet 1
afraid 1
to 1
break 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
his 1
thoughts 1
we 1
had 1
driven 1
several 1
miles 1
and 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
fringe 1
of 1
the 1
belt 1
of 1
suburban 1
villas 1
when 1
he 1
shook 1
himself 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
lit 1
up 1
his 1
pipe 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
satisfied 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
acting 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
grand 1
gift 1
of 1
silence 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
makes 1
you 1
quite 1
invaluable 1
as 1
a 1
companion 1
pon 1
my 1
word 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
someone 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
thoughts 1
are 1
not 1
overpleasant 1
i 1
was 1
wondering 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
say 1
to 1
this 1
dear 1
little 1
woman 1
tonight 1
when 1
she 1
meets 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
you 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
shall 1
just 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
lee 1
it 1
seems 1
absurdly 1
simple 1
and 1
yet 1
somehow 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
nothing 1
to 1
go 1
upon 1
theres 1
plenty 1
of 1
thread 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
get 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
now 1
ill 1
state 1
the 1
case 1
clearly 1
and 1
concisely 1
to 1
you 1
watson 1
and 1
maybe 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
a 1
spark 1
where 1
all 1
is 1
dark 1
to 1
me 1
proceed 1
then 1
some 1
years 1
agoto 1
be 1
definite 1
in 1
may 1
1884there 1
came 1
to 1
lee 1
a 1
gentleman 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
by 1
name 1
who 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
plenty 1
of 1
money 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
villa 1
laid 1
out 1
the 1
grounds 1
very 1
nicely 1
and 1
lived 1
generally 1
in 1
good 1
style 1
by 1
degrees 1
he 1
made 1
friends 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
in 1
1887 1
he 1
married 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
local 1
brewer 1
by 1
whom 1
he 1
now 1
has 1
two 1
children 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
occupation 1
but 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
several 1
companies 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
returning 1
by 1
the 1
514 1
from 1
cannon 1
street 1
every 1
night 1
mr 1
st 1
clair 1
is 1
now 1
thirtyseven 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
temperate 1
habits 1
a 1
good 1
husband 1
a 1
very 1
affectionate 1
father 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
popular 1
with 1
all 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
i 1
may 1
add 1
that 1
his 1
whole 1
debts 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
ascertain 1
amount 1
to 1
88 1
pounds 1
10s 1
while 1
he 1
has 1
220 1
pounds 1
standing 1
to 1
his 1
credit 1
in 1
the 1
capital 1
and 1
counties 1
bank 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
therefore 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
money 1
troubles 1
have 1
been 1
weighing 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
last 1
monday 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
went 1
into 1
town 1
rather 1
earlier 1
than 1
usual 1
remarking 1
before 1
he 1
started 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
two 1
important 1
commissions 1
to 1
perform 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
bring 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
home 1
a 1
box 1
of 1
bricks 1
now 1
by 1
the 1
merest 1
chance 1
his 1
wife 1
received 1
a 1
telegram 1
upon 1
this 1
same 1
monday 1
very 1
shortly 1
after 1
his 1
departure 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
a 1
small 1
parcel 1
of 1
considerable 1
value 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
expecting 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
offices 1
of 1
the 1
aberdeen 1
shipping 1
company 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
up 1
in 1
your 1
london 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
is 1
in 1
fresno 1
street 1
which 1
branches 1
out 1
of 1
upper 1
swandam 1
lane 1
where 1
you 1
found 1
me 1
tonight 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
had 1
her 1
lunch 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
city 1
did 1
some 1
shopping 1
proceeded 1
to 1
the 1
companys 1
office 1
got 1
her 1
packet 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
at 1
exactly 1
435 1
walking 1
through 1
swandam 1
lane 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
have 1
you 1
followed 1
me 1
so 1
far 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
clear 1
if 1
you 1
remember 1
monday 1
was 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
hot 1
day 1
and 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
walked 1
slowly 1
glancing 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
seeing 1
a 1
cab 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
found 1
herself 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
walking 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
down 1
swandam 1
lane 1
she 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
an 1
ejaculation 1
or 1
cry 1
and 1
was 1
struck 1
cold 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
husband 1
looking 1
down 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
beckoning 1
to 1
her 1
from 1
a 1
secondfloor 1
window 1
the 1
window 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
she 1
distinctly 1
saw 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
she 1
describes 1
as 1
being 1
terribly 1
agitated 1
he 1
waved 1
his 1
hands 1
frantically 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
so 1
suddenly 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
plucked 1
back 1
by 1
some 1
irresistible 1
force 1
from 1
behind 1
one 1
singular 1
point 1
which 1
struck 1
her 1
quick 1
feminine 1
eye 1
was 1
that 1
although 1
he 1
wore 1
some 1
dark 1
coat 1
such 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
town 1
in 1
he 1
had 1
on 1
neither 1
collar 1
nor 1
necktie 1
convinced 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
amiss 1
with 1
him 1
she 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
stepsfor 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
found 1
me 1
tonightand 1
running 1
through 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
she 1
attempted 1
to 1
ascend 1
the 1
stairs 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
floor 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
however 1
she 1
met 1
this 1
lascar 1
scoundrel 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
spoken 1
who 1
thrust 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
aided 1
by 1
a 1
dane 1
who 1
acts 1
as 1
assistant 1
there 1
pushed 1
her 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
maddening 1
doubts 1
and 1
fears 1
she 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
by 1
rare 1
goodfortune 1
met 1
in 1
fresno 1
street 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
constables 1
with 1
an 1
inspector 1
all 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
their 1
beat 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
two 1
men 1
accompanied 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
continued 1
resistance 1
of 1
the 1
proprietor 1
they 1
made 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
mr 1
st 1
clair 1
had 1
last 1
been 1
seen 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
him 1
there 1
in 1
fact 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
that 1
floor 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
save 1
a 1
crippled 1
wretch 1
of 1
hideous 1
aspect 1
who 1
it 1
seems 1
made 1
his 1
home 1
there 1
both 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
lascar 1
stoutly 1
swore 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
during 1
the 1
afternoon 1
so 1
determined 1
was 1
their 1
denial 1
that 1
the 1
inspector 1
was 1
staggered 1
and 1
had 1
almost 1
come 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
had 1
been 1
deluded 1
when 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
she 1
sprang 1
at 1
a 1
small 1
deal 1
box 1
which 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
tore 1
the 1
lid 1
from 1
it 1
out 1
there 1
fell 1
a 1
cascade 1
of 1
childrens 1
bricks 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
toy 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
bring 1
home 1
this 1
discovery 1
and 1
the 1
evident 1
confusion 1
which 1
the 1
cripple 1
showed 1
made 1
the 1
inspector 1
realise 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
serious 1
the 1
rooms 1
were 1
carefully 1
examined 1
and 1
results 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
an 1
abominable 1
crime 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
was 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
as 1
a 1
sittingroom 1
and 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
bedroom 1
which 1
looked 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
wharves 1
between 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
the 1
bedroom 1
window 1
is 1
a 1
narrow 1
strip 1
which 1
is 1
dry 1
at 1
low 1
tide 1
but 1
is 1
covered 1
at 1
high 1
tide 1
with 1
at 1
least 1
four 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
feet 1
of 1
water 1
the 1
bedroom 1
window 1
was 1
a 1
broad 1
one 1
and 1
opened 1
from 1
below 1
on 1
examination 1
traces 1
of 1
blood 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
windowsill 1
and 1
several 1
scattered 1
drops 1
were 1
visible 1
upon 1
the 1
wooden 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
bedroom 1
thrust 1
away 1
behind 1
a 1
curtain 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
were 1
all 1
the 1
clothes 1
of 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
his 1
boots 1
his 1
socks 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
watchall 1
were 1
there 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
violence 1
upon 1
any 1
of 1
these 1
garments 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
other 1
traces 1
of 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
must 1
apparently 1
have 1
gone 1
for 1
no 1
other 1
exit 1
could 1
be 1
discovered 1
and 1
the 1
ominous 1
bloodstains 1
upon 1
the 1
sill 1
gave 1
little 1
promise 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
save 1
himself 1
by 1
swimming 1
for 1
the 1
tide 1
was 1
at 1
its 1
very 1
highest 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
villains 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
immediately 1
implicated 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
lascar 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
vilest 1
antecedents 1
but 1
as 1
by 1
mrs 1
st 1
clairs 1
story 1
he 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stair 1
within 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
seconds 1
of 1
her 1
husbands 1
appearance 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
accessory 1
to 1
the 1
crime 1
his 1
defence 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
absolute 1
ignorance 1
and 1
he 1
protested 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
doings 1
of 1
hugh 1
boone 1
his 1
lodger 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
gentlemans 1
clothes 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
lascar 1
manager 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
sinister 1
cripple 1
who 1
lives 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
certainly 1
the 1
last 1
human 1
being 1
whose 1
eyes 1
rested 1
upon 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
hugh 1
boone 1
and 1
his 1
hideous 1
face 1
is 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
goes 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
city 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
professional 1
beggar 1
though 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
police 1
regulations 1
he 1
pretends 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
trade 1
in 1
wax 1
vestas 1
some 1
little 1
distance 1
down 1
threadneedle 1
street 1
upon 1
the 1
lefthand 1
side 1
there 1
is 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
remarked 1
a 1
small 1
angle 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
this 1
creature 1
takes 1
his 1
daily 1
seat 1
crosslegged 1
with 1
his 1
tiny 1
stock 1
of 1
matches 1
on 1
his 1
lap 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
piteous 1
spectacle 1
a 1
small 1
rain 1
of 1
charity 1
descends 1
into 1
the 1
greasy 1
leather 1
cap 1
which 1
lies 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
beside 1
him 1
i 1
have 1
watched 1
the 1
fellow 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
before 1
ever 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
making 1
his 1
professional 1
acquaintance 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
surprised 1
at 1
the 1
harvest 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
reaped 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
his 1
appearance 1
you 1
see 1
is 1
so 1
remarkable 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
pass 1
him 1
without 1
observing 1
him 1
a 1
shock 1
of 1
orange 1
hair 1
a 1
pale 1
face 1
disfigured 1
by 1
a 1
horrible 1
scar 1
which 1
by 1
its 1
contraction 1
has 1
turned 1
up 1
the 1
outer 1
edge 1
of 1
his 1
upper 1
lip 1
a 1
bulldog 1
chin 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
very 1
penetrating 1
dark 1
eyes 1
which 1
present 1
a 1
singular 1
contrast 1
to 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
his 1
hair 1
all 1
mark 1
him 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
common 1
crowd 1
of 1
mendicants 1
and 1
so 1
too 1
does 1
his 1
wit 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
ever 1
ready 1
with 1
a 1
reply 1
to 1
any 1
piece 1
of 1
chaff 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
thrown 1
at 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
passersby 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
we 1
now 1
learn 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
lodger 1
at 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
last 1
man 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
gentleman 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
quest 1
but 1
a 1
cripple 1
said 1
i 1
what 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
done 1
singlehanded 1
against 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
prime 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
cripple 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
that 1
he 1
walks 1
with 1
a 1
limp 1
but 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
he 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
powerful 1
and 1
wellnurtured 1
man 1
surely 1
your 1
medical 1
experience 1
would 1
tell 1
you 1
watson 1
that 1
weakness 1
in 1
one 1
limb 1
is 1
often 1
compensated 1
for 1
by 1
exceptional 1
strength 1
in 1
the 1
others 1
pray 1
continue 1
your 1
narrative 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
had 1
fainted 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
blood 1
upon 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
escorted 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
as 1
her 1
presence 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
no 1
help 1
to 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
investigations 1
inspector 1
barton 1
who 1
had 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
premises 1
but 1
without 1
finding 1
anything 1
which 1
threw 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
one 1
mistake 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
in 1
not 1
arresting 1
boone 1
instantly 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
allowed 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
communicated 1
with 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
lascar 1
but 1
this 1
fault 1
was 1
soon 1
remedied 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
and 1
searched 1
without 1
anything 1
being 1
found 1
which 1
could 1
incriminate 1
him 1
there 1
were 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
some 1
bloodstains 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
shirtsleeve 1
but 1
he 1
pointed 1
to 1
his 1
ringfinger 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
near 1
the 1
nail 1
and 1
explained 1
that 1
the 1
bleeding 1
came 1
from 1
there 1
adding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
stains 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
observed 1
there 1
came 1
doubtless 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
source 1
he 1
denied 1
strenuously 1
having 1
ever 1
seen 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
and 1
swore 1
that 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
clothes 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
a 1
mystery 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
as 1
to 1
mrs 1
st 1
clairs 1
assertion 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
actually 1
seen 1
her 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
declared 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
either 1
mad 1
or 1
dreaming 1
he 1
was 1
removed 1
loudly 1
protesting 1
to 1
the 1
policestation 1
while 1
the 1
inspector 1
remained 1
upon 1
the 1
premises 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
ebbing 1
tide 1
might 1
afford 1
some 1
fresh 1
clue 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
though 1
they 1
hardly 1
found 1
upon 1
the 1
mudbank 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
feared 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
was 1
neville 1
st 1
clairs 1
coat 1
and 1
not 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
which 1
lay 1
uncovered 1
as 1
the 1
tide 1
receded 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
they 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
i 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
you 1
would 1
guess 1
every 1
pocket 1
stuffed 1
with 1
pennies 1
and 1
halfpennies421 1
pennies 1
and 1
270 1
halfpennies 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
swept 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
tide 1
but 1
a 1
human 1
body 1
is 1
a 1
different 1
matter 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
fierce 1
eddy 1
between 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
the 1
house 1
it 1
seemed 1
likely 1
enough 1
that 1
the 1
weighted 1
coat 1
had 1
remained 1
when 1
the 1
stripped 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
sucked 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
clothes 1
were 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
would 1
the 1
body 1
be 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
coat 1
alone 1
no 1
sir 1
but 1
the 1
facts 1
might 1
be 1
met 1
speciously 1
enough 1
suppose 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
boone 1
had 1
thrust 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
human 1
eye 1
which 1
could 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
deed 1
what 1
would 1
he 1
do 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
of 1
course 1
instantly 1
strike 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
telltale 1
garments 1
he 1
would 1
seize 1
the 1
coat 1
then 1
and 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
throwing 1
it 1
out 1
when 1
it 1
would 1
occur 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
swim 1
and 1
not 1
sink 1
he 1
has 1
little 1
time 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
heard 1
the 1
scuffle 1
downstairs 1
when 1
the 1
wife 1
tried 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
way 1
up 1
and 1
perhaps 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
heard 1
from 1
his 1
lascar 1
confederate 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
are 1
hurrying 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
he 1
rushes 1
to 1
some 1
secret 1
hoard 1
where 1
he 1
has 1
accumulated 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
his 1
beggary 1
and 1
he 1
stuffs 1
all 1
the 1
coins 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
can 1
lay 1
his 1
hands 1
into 1
the 1
pockets 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
of 1
the 1
coats 1
sinking 1
he 1
throws 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
garments 1
had 1
not 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
rush 1
of 1
steps 1
below 1
and 1
only 1
just 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
close 1
the 1
window 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
appeared 1
it 1
certainly 1
sounds 1
feasible 1
well 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
working 1
hypothesis 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
better 1
boone 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
was 1
arrested 1
and 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
but 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
shown 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
been 1
anything 1
against 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
for 1
years 1
been 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
professional 1
beggar 1
but 1
his 1
life 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
quiet 1
and 1
innocent 1
one 1
there 1
the 1
matter 1
stands 1
at 1
present 1
and 1
the 1
questions 1
which 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
solvedwhat 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
was 1
doing 1
in 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
what 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
there 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
now 1
and 1
what 1
hugh 1
boone 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
his 1
disappearanceare 1
all 1
as 1
far 1
from 1
a 1
solution 1
as 1
ever 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
recall 1
any 1
case 1
within 1
my 1
experience 1
which 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
glance 1
so 1
simple 1
and 1
yet 1
which 1
presented 1
such 1
difficulties 1
while 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
been 1
detailing 1
this 1
singular 1
series 1
of 1
events 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
whirling 1
through 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
town 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
straggling 1
houses 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
behind 1
and 1
we 1
rattled 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
country 1
hedge 1
upon 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
us 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
finished 1
however 1
we 1
drove 1
through 1
two 1
scattered 1
villages 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
lights 1
still 1
glimmered 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
we 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
lee 1
said 1
my 1
companion 1
we 1
have 1
touched 1
on 1
three 1
english 1
counties 1
in 1
our 1
short 1
drive 1
starting 1
in 1
middlesex 1
passing 1
over 1
an 1
angle 1
of 1
surrey 1
and 1
ending 1
in 1
kent 1
see 1
that 1
light 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
cedars 1
and 1
beside 1
that 1
lamp 1
sits 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
anxious 1
ears 1
have 1
already 1
i 1
have 1
little 1
doubt 1
caught 1
the 1
clink 1
of 1
our 1
horses 1
feet 1
but 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
conducting 1
the 1
case 1
from 1
baker 1
street 1
i 1
asked 1
because 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
inquiries 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
made 1
out 1
here 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
has 1
most 1
kindly 1
put 1
two 1
rooms 1
at 1
my 1
disposal 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
rest 1
assured 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
welcome 1
for 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
i 1
hate 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
watson 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
news 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
whoa 1
there 1
whoa 1
we 1
had 1
pulled 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
villa 1
which 1
stood 1
within 1
its 1
own 1
grounds 1
a 1
stableboy 1
had 1
run 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
horses 1
head 1
and 1
springing 1
down 1
i 1
followed 1
holmes 1
up 1
the 1
small 1
winding 1
graveldrive 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
blonde 1
woman 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
opening 1
clad 1
in 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
light 1
mousseline 1
de 1
soie 1
with 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
fluffy 1
pink 1
chiffon 1
at 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
wrists 1
she 1
stood 1
with 1
her 1
figure 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
flood 1
of 1
light 1
one 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
one 1
halfraised 1
in 1
her 1
eagerness 1
her 1
body 1
slightly 1
bent 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
face 1
protruded 1
with 1
eager 1
eyes 1
and 1
parted 1
lips 1
a 1
standing 1
question 1
well 1
she 1
cried 1
well 1
and 1
then 1
seeing 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
she 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
hope 1
which 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
groan 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
no 1
good 1
news 1
none 1
no 1
bad 1
no 1
thank 1
god 1
for 1
that 1
but 1
come 1
in 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
weary 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
dr 1
watson 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
of 1
most 1
vital 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
several 1
of 1
my 1
cases 1
and 1
a 1
lucky 1
chance 1
has 1
made 1
it 1
possible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
associate 1
him 1
with 1
this 1
investigation 1
i 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
said 1
she 1
pressing 1
my 1
hand 1
warmly 1
you 1
will 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
forgive 1
anything 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
wanting 1
in 1
our 1
arrangements 1
when 1
you 1
consider 1
the 1
blow 1
which 1
has 1
come 1
so 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
us 1
my 1
dear 1
madam 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
old 1
campaigner 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
not 1
i 1
can 1
very 1
well 1
see 1
that 1
no 1
apology 1
is 1
needed 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
assistance 1
either 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
here 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
indeed 1
happy 1
now 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
a 1
welllit 1
diningroom 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
of 1
which 1
a 1
cold 1
supper 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
out 1
i 1
should 1
very 1
much 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
plain 1
questions 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
a 1
plain 1
answer 1
certainly 1
madam 1
do 1
not 1
trouble 1
about 1
my 1
feelings 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
hysterical 1
nor 1
given 1
to 1
fainting 1
i 1
simply 1
wish 1
to 1
hear 1
your 1
real 1
real 1
opinion 1
upon 1
what 1
point 1
in 1
your 1
heart 1
of 1
hearts 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
neville 1
is 1
alive 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
embarrassed 1
by 1
the 1
question 1
frankly 1
now 1
she 1
repeated 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
rug 1
and 1
looking 1
keenly 1
down 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
basketchair 1
frankly 1
then 1
madam 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
i 1
do 1
murdered 1
i 1
dont 1
say 1
that 1
perhaps 1
and 1
on 1
what 1
day 1
did 1
he 1
meet 1
his 1
death 1
on 1
monday 1
then 1
perhaps 1
mr 1
holmes 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
explain 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
him 1
today 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
galvanised 1
what 1
he 1
roared 1
yes 1
today 1
she 1
stood 1
smiling 1
holding 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
may 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
certainly 1
he 1
snatched 1
it 1
from 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
eagerness 1
and 1
smoothing 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
drew 1
over 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
intently 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
my 1
chair 1
and 1
was 1
gazing 1
at 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
the 1
envelope 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
coarse 1
one 1
and 1
was 1
stamped 1
with 1
the 1
gravesend 1
postmark 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
or 1
rather 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
considerably 1
after 1
midnight 1
coarse 1
writing 1
murmured 1
holmes 1
surely 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
husbands 1
writing 1
madam 1
no 1
but 1
the 1
enclosure 1
is 1
i 1
perceive 1
also 1
that 1
whoever 1
addressed 1
the 1
envelope 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
inquire 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
address 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
that 1
the 1
name 1
you 1
see 1
is 1
in 1
perfectly 1
black 1
ink 1
which 1
has 1
dried 1
itself 1
the 1
rest 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
greyish 1
colour 1
which 1
shows 1
that 1
blottingpaper 1
has 1
been 1
used 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
written 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
blotted 1
none 1
would 1
be 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
black 1
shade 1
this 1
man 1
has 1
written 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
there 1
has 1
then 1
been 1
a 1
pause 1
before 1
he 1
wrote 1
the 1
address 1
which 1
can 1
only 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
familiar 1
with 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
trifle 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
so 1
important 1
as 1
trifles 1
let 1
us 1
now 1
see 1
the 1
letter 1
ha 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
enclosure 1
here 1
yes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
ring 1
his 1
signetring 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
husbands 1
hand 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
one 1
his 1
hand 1
when 1
he 1
wrote 1
hurriedly 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
unlike 1
his 1
usual 1
writing 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
well 1
dearest 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
frightened 1
all 1
will 1
come 1
well 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
huge 1
error 1
which 1
it 1
may 1
take 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
to 1
rectify 1
wait 1

who 1

i 1
should 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
is 1
over 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
alive 1
mr 1
holmes 1
unless 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
clever 1
forgery 1
to 1
put 1
us 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
scent 1
the 1

own 1
writing 1
very 1
well 1
it 1
may 1
however 1
have 1
been 1
written 1
on 1
monday 1
and 1
only 1
posted 1
today 1
that 1
is 1
possible 1
if 1
so 1
much 1
may 1
have 1
happened 1
between 1
oh 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
discourage 1
me 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
all 1
is 1
well 1
with 1
him 1
there 1
is 1
so 1
keen 1
a 1
sympathy 1
between 1
us 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
know 1
if 1
evil 1
came 1
upon 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
that 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
last 1
he 1
cut 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
bedroom 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
in 1
the 1
diningroom 1
rushed 1
upstairs 1
instantly 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
certainty 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
respond 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
trifle 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
ignorant 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
too 1
much 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
may 1
be 1
more 1
valuable 1
than 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
an 1
analytical 1
reasoner 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
letter 1
you 1
certainly 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
strong 1
piece 1
of 1
evidence 1
to 1
corroborate 1
your 1
view 1
but 1
if 1
your 1
husband 1
is 1
alive 1
and 1
able 1
to 1
write 1
letters 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
remain 1
away 1
from 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
it 1
is 1
unthinkable 1
and 1
on 1
monday 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
remarks 1
before 1
leaving 1
you 1
no 1
and 1
you 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
in 1
swandam 1
lane 1
very 1
much 1
so 1
was 1
the 1
window 1
open 1
yes 1
then 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
called 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
might 1
he 1
only 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
gave 1
an 1
inarticulate 1
cry 1
yes 1
a 1
call 1
for 1
help 1
you 1
thought 1
yes 1
he 1
waved 1
his 1
hands 1
but 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
astonishment 1
at 1
the 1
unexpected 1
sight 1
of 1
you 1
might 1
cause 1
him 1
to 1
throw 1
up 1
his 1
hands 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
and 1
you 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
pulled 1
back 1
he 1
disappeared 1
so 1
suddenly 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
leaped 1
back 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
anyone 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
no 1
but 1
this 1
horrible 1
man 1
confessed 1
to 1
having 1
been 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
lascar 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
quite 1
so 1
your 1
husband 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
had 1
his 1
ordinary 1
clothes 1
on 1
but 1
without 1
his 1
collar 1
or 1
tie 1
i 1
distinctly 1
saw 1
his 1
bare 1
throat 1
had 1
he 1
ever 1
spoken 1
of 1
swandam 1
lane 1
never 1
had 1
he 1
ever 1
showed 1
any 1
signs 1
of 1
having 1
taken 1
opium 1
never 1
thank 1
you 1
mrs 1
st 1
clair 1
those 1
are 1
the 1
principal 1
points 1
about 1
which 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
we 1
shall 1
now 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
supper 1
and 1
then 1
retire 1
for 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
busy 1
day 1
tomorrow 1
a 1
large 1
and 1
comfortable 1
doublebedded 1
room 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
at 1
our 1
disposal 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
quickly 1
between 1
the 1
sheets 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
weary 1
after 1
my 1
night 1
of 1
adventure 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
however 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
unsolved 1
problem 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
would 1
go 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
without 1
rest 1
turning 1
it 1
over 1
rearranging 1
his 1
facts 1
looking 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
either 1
fathomed 1
it 1
or 1
convinced 1
himself 1
that 1
his 1
data 1
were 1
insufficient 1
it 1
was 1
soon 1
evident 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
preparing 1
for 1
an 1
allnight 1
sitting 1
he 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
waistcoat 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
blue 1
dressinggown 1
and 1
then 1
wandered 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
collecting 1
pillows 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
cushions 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
armchairs 1
with 1
these 1
he 1
constructed 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
eastern 1
divan 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
perched 1
himself 1
crosslegged 1
with 1
an 1
ounce 1
of 1
shag 1
tobacco 1
and 1
a 1
box 1
of 1
matches 1
laid 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
sitting 1
there 1
an 1
old 1
briar 1
pipe 1
between 1
his 1
lips 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
vacantly 1
upon 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
the 1
blue 1
smoke 1
curling 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
silent 1
motionless 1
with 1
the 1
light 1
shining 1
upon 1
his 1
strongset 1
aquiline 1
features 1
so 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
i 1
dropped 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
sat 1
when 1
a 1
sudden 1
ejaculation 1
caused 1
me 1
to 1
wake 1
up 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
summer 1
sun 1
shining 1
into 1
the 1
apartment 1
the 1
pipe 1
was 1
still 1
between 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
smoke 1
still 1
curled 1
upward 1
and 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
a 1
dense 1
tobacco 1
haze 1
but 1
nothing 1
remained 1
of 1
the 1
heap 1
of 1
shag 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
awake 1
watson 1
he 1
asked 1
yes 1
game 1
for 1
a 1
morning 1
drive 1
certainly 1
then 1
dress 1
no 1
one 1
is 1
stirring 1
yet 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
stableboy 1
sleeps 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
the 1
trap 1
out 1
he 1
chuckled 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
his 1
eyes 1
twinkled 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
a 1
different 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
sombre 1
thinker 1
of 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
as 1
i 1
dressed 1
i 1
glanced 1
at 1
my 1
watch 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
stirring 1
it 1
was 1
twentyfive 1
minutes 1
past 1
four 1
i 1
had 1
hardly 1
finished 1
when 1
holmes 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
news 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
putting 1
in 1
the 1
horse 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
test 1
a 1
little 1
theory 1
of 1
mine 1
said 1
he 1
pulling 1
on 1
his 1
boots 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
now 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
absolute 1
fools 1
in 1
europe 1
i 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
kicked 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
charing 1
cross 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
now 1
and 1
where 1
is 1
it 1
i 1
asked 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
bathroom 1
he 1
answered 1
oh 1
yes 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
joking 1
he 1
continued 1
seeing 1
my 1
look 1
of 1
incredulity 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
there 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
taken 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
gladstone 1
bag 1
come 1
on 1
my 1
boy 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whether 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
fit 1
the 1
lock 1
we 1
made 1
our 1
way 1
downstairs 1
as 1
quietly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
bright 1
morning 1
sunshine 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
stood 1
our 1
horse 1
and 1
trap 1
with 1
the 1
halfclad 1
stableboy 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
we 1
both 1
sprang 1
in 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
dashed 1
down 1
the 1
london 1
road 1
a 1
few 1
country 1
carts 1
were 1
stirring 1
bearing 1
in 1
vegetables 1
to 1
the 1
metropolis 1
but 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
villas 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
were 1
as 1
silent 1
and 1
lifeless 1
as 1
some 1
city 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
some 1
points 1
a 1
singular 1
case 1
said 1
holmes 1
flicking 1
the 1
horse 1
on 1
into 1
a 1
gallop 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
blind 1
as 1
a 1
mole 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
learn 1
wisdom 1
late 1
than 1
never 1
to 1
learn 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
town 1
the 1
earliest 1
risers 1
were 1
just 1
beginning 1
to 1
look 1
sleepily 1
from 1
their 1
windows 1
as 1
we 1
drove 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
the 1
surrey 1
side 1
passing 1
down 1
the 1
waterloo 1
bridge 1
road 1
we 1
crossed 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
dashing 1
up 1
wellington 1
street 1
wheeled 1
sharply 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
bow 1
street 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
force 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
constables 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
saluted 1
him 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
held 1
the 1
horses 1
head 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
led 1
us 1
in 1
who 1
is 1
on 1
duty 1
asked 1
holmes 1
inspector 1
bradstreet 1
sir 1
ah 1
bradstreet 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
a 1
tall 1
stout 1
official 1
had 1
come 1
down 1
the 1
stoneflagged 1
passage 1
in 1
a 1
peaked 1
cap 1
and 1
frogged 1
jacket 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
quiet 1
word 1
with 1
you 1
bradstreet 1
certainly 1
mr 1
holmes 1
step 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
here 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
officelike 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
huge 1
ledger 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
telephone 1
projecting 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
the 1
inspector 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
desk 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
for 1
you 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
called 1
about 1
that 1
beggarman 1
boonethe 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
charged 1
with 1
being 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
of 1
lee 1
yes 1
he 1
was 1
brought 1
up 1
and 1
remanded 1
for 1
further 1
inquiries 1
so 1
i 1
heard 1
you 1
have 1
him 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
cells 1
is 1
he 1
quiet 1
oh 1
he 1
gives 1
no 1
trouble 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
dirty 1
scoundrel 1
dirty 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
wash 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
is 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
a 1
tinkers 1
well 1
when 1
once 1
his 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
settled 1
he 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
regular 1
prison 1
bath 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
you 1
would 1
agree 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
needed 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
very 1
much 1
would 1
you 1
that 1
is 1
easily 1
done 1
come 1
this 1
way 1
you 1
can 1
leave 1
your 1
bag 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
ill 1
take 1
it 1
very 1
good 1
come 1
this 1
way 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
he 1
led 1
us 1
down 1
a 1
passage 1
opened 1
a 1
barred 1
door 1
passed 1
down 1
a 1
winding 1
stair 1
and 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
whitewashed 1
corridor 1
with 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
doors 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
the 1
third 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
is 1
his 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
he 1
quietly 1
shot 1
back 1
a 1
panel 1
in 1
the 1
upper 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
glanced 1
through 1
he 1
is 1
asleep 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
him 1
very 1
well 1
we 1
both 1
put 1
our 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
grating 1
the 1
prisoner 1
lay 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
towards 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
deep 1
sleep 1
breathing 1
slowly 1
and 1
heavily 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
middlesized 1
man 1
coarsely 1
clad 1
as 1
became 1
his 1
calling 1
with 1
a 1
coloured 1
shirt 1
protruding 1
through 1
the 1
rent 1
in 1
his 1
tattered 1
coat 1
he 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
inspector 1
had 1
said 1
extremely 1
dirty 1
but 1
the 1
grime 1
which 1
covered 1
his 1
face 1
could 1
not 1
conceal 1
its 1
repulsive 1
ugliness 1
a 1
broad 1
wheal 1
from 1
an 1
old 1
scar 1
ran 1
right 1
across 1
it 1
from 1
eye 1
to 1
chin 1
and 1
by 1
its 1
contraction 1
had 1
turned 1
up 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
lip 1
so 1
that 1
three 1
teeth 1
were 1
exposed 1
in 1
a 1
perpetual 1
snarl 1
a 1
shock 1
of 1
very 1
bright 1
red 1
hair 1
grew 1
low 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
forehead 1
hes 1
a 1
beauty 1
isnt 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
he 1
certainly 1
needs 1
a 1
wash 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
bringing 1
the 1
tools 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
gladstone 1
bag 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
astonishment 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
bathsponge 1
he 1
he 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
funny 1
one 1
chuckled 1
the 1
inspector 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
goodness 1
to 1
open 1
that 1
door 1
very 1
quietly 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
make 1
him 1
cut 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
respectable 1
figure 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
why 1
not 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
he 1
doesnt 1
look 1
a 1
credit 1
to 1
the 1
bow 1
street 1
cells 1
does 1
he 1
he 1
slipped 1
his 1
key 1
into 1
the 1
lock 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
very 1
quietly 1
entered 1
the 1
cell 1
the 1
sleeper 1
half 1
turned 1
and 1
then 1
settled 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
slumber 1
holmes 1
stooped 1
to 1
the 1
waterjug 1
moistened 1
his 1
sponge 1
and 1
then 1
rubbed 1
it 1
twice 1
vigorously 1
across 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
prisoners 1
face 1
let 1
me 1
introduce 1
you 1
he 1
shouted 1
to 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
of 1
lee 1
in 1
the 1
county 1
of 1
kent 1
never 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
have 1
i 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
sight 1
the 1
mans 1
face 1
peeled 1
off 1
under 1
the 1
sponge 1
like 1
the 1
bark 1
from 1
a 1
tree 1
gone 1
was 1
the 1
coarse 1
brown 1
tint 1
gone 1
too 1
was 1
the 1
horrid 1
scar 1
which 1
had 1
seamed 1
it 1
across 1
and 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
which 1
had 1
given 1
the 1
repulsive 1
sneer 1
to 1
the 1
face 1
a 1
twitch 1
brought 1
away 1
the 1
tangled 1
red 1
hair 1
and 1
there 1
sitting 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
was 1
a 1
pale 1
sadfaced 1
refinedlooking 1
man 1
blackhaired 1
and 1
smoothskinned 1
rubbing 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
staring 1
about 1
him 1
with 1
sleepy 1
bewilderment 1
then 1
suddenly 1
realising 1
the 1
exposure 1
he 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
scream 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
pillow 1
great 1
heavens 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
i 1
know 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
photograph 1
the 1
prisoner 1
turned 1
with 1
the 1
reckless 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
abandons 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
destiny 1
be 1
it 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
pray 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
charged 1
with 1
with 1
making 1
away 1
with 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
oh 1
come 1
you 1
cant 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
that 1
unless 1
they 1
make 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
attempted 1
suicide 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
with 1
a 1
grin 1
well 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
twentyseven 1
years 1
in 1
the 1
force 1
but 1
this 1
really 1
takes 1
the 1
cake 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
no 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
and 1
that 1
therefore 1
i 1
am 1
illegally 1
detained 1
no 1
crime 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
error 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
said 1
holmes 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
better 1
to 1
have 1
trusted 1
your 1
wife 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
wife 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
children 1
groaned 1
the 1
prisoner 1
god 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
them 1
ashamed 1
of 1
their 1
father 1
my 1
god 1
what 1
an 1
exposure 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
patted 1
him 1
kindly 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
if 1
you 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
court 1
of 1
law 1
to 1
clear 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
said 1
he 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
avoid 1
publicity 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
if 1
you 1
convince 1
the 1
police 1
authorities 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
possible 1
case 1
against 1
you 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
reason 1
that 1
the 1
details 1
should 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
papers 1
inspector 1
bradstreet 1
would 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
make 1
notes 1
upon 1
anything 1
which 1
you 1
might 1
tell 1
us 1
and 1
submit 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
proper 1
authorities 1
the 1
case 1
would 1
then 1
never 1
go 1
into 1
court 1
at 1
all 1
god 1
bless 1
you 1
cried 1
the 1
prisoner 1
passionately 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
endured 1
imprisonment 1
ay 1
even 1
execution 1
rather 1
than 1
have 1
left 1
my 1
miserable 1
secret 1
as 1
a 1
family 1
blot 1
to 1
my 1
children 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
first 1
who 1
have 1
ever 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
chesterfield 1
where 1
i 1
received 1
an 1
excellent 1
education 1
i 1
travelled 1
in 1
my 1
youth 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
finally 1
became 1
a 1
reporter 1
on 1
an 1
evening 1
paper 1
in 1
london 1
one 1
day 1
my 1
editor 1
wished 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
articles 1
upon 1
begging 1
in 1
the 1
metropolis 1
and 1
i 1
volunteered 1
to 1
supply 1
them 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
point 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
my 1
adventures 1
started 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
by 1
trying 1
begging 1
as 1
an 1
amateur 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
the 1
facts 1
upon 1
which 1
to 1
base 1
my 1
articles 1
when 1
an 1
actor 1
i 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
learned 1
all 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
making 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
famous 1
in 1
the 1
greenroom 1
for 1
my 1
skill 1
i 1
took 1
advantage 1
now 1
of 1
my 1
attainments 1
i 1
painted 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
as 1
pitiable 1
as 1
possible 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
good 1
scar 1
and 1
fixed 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
my 1
lip 1
in 1
a 1
twist 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
slip 1
of 1
fleshcoloured 1
plaster 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
head 1
of 1
hair 1
and 1
an 1
appropriate 1
dress 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
station 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
ostensibly 1
as 1
a 1
matchseller 1
but 1
really 1
as 1
a 1
beggar 1
for 1
seven 1
hours 1
i 1
plied 1
my 1
trade 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
i 1
found 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
received 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
26s 1
4d 1
i 1
wrote 1
my 1
articles 1
and 1
thought 1
little 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
until 1
some 1
time 1
later 1
i 1
backed 1
a 1
bill 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
writ 1
served 1
upon 1
me 1
for 1
25 1
pounds 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
wits 1
end 1
where 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
money 1
but 1
a 1
sudden 1
idea 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
begged 1
a 1
fortnights 1
grace 1
from 1
the 1
creditor 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
holiday 1
from 1
my 1
employers 1
and 1
spent 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
begging 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
under 1
my 1
disguise 1
in 1
ten 1
days 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
had 1
paid 1
the 1
debt 1
well 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
hard 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
to 1
arduous 1
work 1
at 1
2 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
when 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
earn 1
as 1
much 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
by 1
smearing 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
paint 1
laying 1
my 1
cap 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
sitting 1
still 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
fight 1
between 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
the 1
money 1
but 1
the 1
dollars 1
won 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
i 1
threw 1
up 1
reporting 1
and 1
sat 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
chosen 1
inspiring 1
pity 1
by 1
my 1
ghastly 1
face 1
and 1
filling 1
my 1
pockets 1
with 1
coppers 1
only 1
one 1
man 1
knew 1
my 1
secret 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
keeper 1
of 1
a 1
low 1
den 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
lodge 1
in 1
swandam 1
lane 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
every 1
morning 1
emerge 1
as 1
a 1
squalid 1
beggar 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
transform 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
welldressed 1
man 1
about 1
town 1
this 1
fellow 1
a 1
lascar 1
was 1
well 1
paid 1
by 1
me 1
for 1
his 1
rooms 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
secret 1
was 1
safe 1
in 1
his 1
possession 1
well 1
very 1
soon 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
saving 1
considerable 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
any 1
beggar 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
london 1
could 1
earn 1
700 1
pounds 1
a 1
yearwhich 1
is 1
less 1
than 1
my 1
average 1
takingsbut 1
i 1
had 1
exceptional 1
advantages 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
of 1
making 1
up 1
and 1
also 1
in 1
a 1
facility 1
of 1
repartee 1
which 1
improved 1
by 1
practice 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
quite 1
a 1
recognised 1
character 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
all 1
day 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
pennies 1
varied 1
by 1
silver 1
poured 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
day 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
failed 1
to 1
take 1
2 1
pounds 1
as 1
i 1
grew 1
richer 1
i 1
grew 1
more 1
ambitious 1
took 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
eventually 1
married 1
without 1
anyone 1
having 1
a 1
suspicion 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
real 1
occupation 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
business 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
she 1
little 1
knew 1
what 1
last 1
monday 1
i 1
had 1
finished 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
was 1
dressing 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
above 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
window 1
and 1
saw 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
and 1
astonishment 1
that 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
her 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
full 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
threw 1
up 1
my 1
arms 1
to 1
cover 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
my 1
confidant 1
the 1
lascar 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
prevent 1
anyone 1
from 1
coming 1
up 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
heard 1
her 1
voice 1
downstairs 1
but 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
ascend 1
swiftly 1
i 1
threw 1
off 1
my 1
clothes 1
pulled 1
on 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
beggar 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
pigments 1
and 1
wig 1
even 1
a 1
wifes 1
eyes 1
could 1
not 1
pierce 1
so 1
complete 1
a 1
disguise 1
but 1
then 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
search 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
clothes 1
might 1
betray 1
me 1
i 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
reopening 1
by 1
my 1
violence 1
a 1
small 1
cut 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bedroom 1
that 1
morning 1
then 1
i 1
seized 1
my 1
coat 1
which 1
was 1
weighted 1
by 1
the 1
coppers 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
transferred 1
to 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
leather 1
bag 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
carried 1
my 1
takings 1
i 1
hurled 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
it 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
thames 1
the 1
other 1
clothes 1
would 1
have 1
followed 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
of 1
constables 1
up 1
the 1
stair 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
i 1
found 1
rather 1
i 1
confess 1
to 1
my 1
relief 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
identified 1
as 1
mr 1
neville 1
st 1
clair 1
i 1
was 1
arrested 1
as 1
his 1
murderer 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
else 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
explain 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
preserve 1
my 1
disguise 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
hence 1
my 1
preference 1
for 1
a 1
dirty 1
face 1
knowing 1
that 1
my 1
wife 1
would 1
be 1
terribly 1
anxious 1
i 1
slipped 1
off 1
my 1
ring 1
and 1
confided 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
lascar 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
no 1
constable 1
was 1
watching 1
me 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
hurried 1
scrawl 1
telling 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
cause 1
to 1
fear 1
that 1
note 1
only 1
reached 1
her 1
yesterday 1
said 1
holmes 1
good 1
god 1
what 1
a 1
week 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
spent 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
watched 1
this 1
lascar 1
said 1
inspector 1
bradstreet 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
post 1
a 1
letter 1
unobserved 1
probably 1
he 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
some 1
sailor 1
customer 1
of 1
his 1
who 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
said 1
holmes 1
nodding 1
approvingly 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
never 1
been 1
prosecuted 1
for 1
begging 1
many 1
times 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
must 1
stop 1
here 1
however 1
said 1
bradstreet 1
if 1
the 1
police 1
are 1
to 1
hush 1
this 1
thing 1
up 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
hugh 1
boone 1
i 1
have 1
sworn 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
solemn 1
oaths 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
take 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
no 1
further 1
steps 1
may 1
be 1
taken 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
found 1
again 1
then 1
all 1
must 1
come 1
out 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
mr 1
holmes 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
much 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
having 1
cleared 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
knew 1
how 1
you 1
reach 1
your 1
results 1
i 1
reached 1
this 1
one 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
by 1
sitting 1
upon 1
five 1
pillows 1
and 1
consuming 1
an 1
ounce 1
of 1
shag 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
drive 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
we 1
shall 1
just 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
breakfast 1
vii 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
i 1
had 1
called 1
upon 1
my 1
friend 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
morning 1
after 1
christmas 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
wishing 1
him 1
the 1
compliments 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
he 1
was 1
lounging 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
in 1
a 1
purple 1
dressinggown 1
a 1
piperack 1
within 1
his 1
reach 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
crumpled 1
morning 1
papers 1
evidently 1
newly 1
studied 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
beside 1
the 1
couch 1
was 1
a 1
wooden 1
chair 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
back 1
hung 1
a 1
very 1
seedy 1
and 1
disreputable 1
hardfelt 1
hat 1
much 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
wear 1
and 1
cracked 1
in 1
several 1
places 1
a 1
lens 1
and 1
a 1
forceps 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
the 1
chair 1
suggested 1
that 1
the 1
hat 1
had 1
been 1
suspended 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
examination 1
you 1
are 1
engaged 1
said 1
i 1
perhaps 1
i 1
interrupt 1
you 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
friend 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
discuss 1
my 1
results 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
trivial 1
onehe 1
jerked 1
his 1
thumb 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
hatbut 1
there 1
are 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
which 1
are 1
not 1
entirely 1
devoid 1
of 1
interest 1
and 1
even 1
of 1
instruction 1
i 1
seated 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
warmed 1
my 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
crackling 1
fire 1
for 1
a 1
sharp 1
frost 1
had 1
set 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
thick 1
with 1
the 1
ice 1
crystals 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
remarked 1
that 1
homely 1
as 1
it 1
looks 1
this 1
thing 1
has 1
some 1
deadly 1
story 1
linked 1
on 1
to 1
itthat 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
clue 1
which 1
will 1
guide 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
solution 1
of 1
some 1
mystery 1
and 1
the 1
punishment 1
of 1
some 1
crime 1
no 1
no 1
no 1
crime 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whimsical 1
little 1
incidents 1
which 1
will 1
happen 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
four 1
million 1
human 1
beings 1
all 1
jostling 1
each 1
other 1
within 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
square 1
miles 1
amid 1
the 1
action 1
and 1
reaction 1
of 1
so 1
dense 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
humanity 1
every 1
possible 1
combination 1
of 1
events 1
may 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
little 1
problem 1
will 1
be 1
presented 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
striking 1
and 1
bizarre 1
without 1
being 1
criminal 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
had 1
experience 1
of 1
such 1
so 1
much 1
so 1
i 1
remarked 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
six 1
cases 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
added 1
to 1
my 1
notes 1
three 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
free 1
of 1
any 1
legal 1
crime 1
precisely 1
you 1
allude 1
to 1
my 1
attempt 1
to 1
recover 1
the 1
irene 1
adler 1
papers 1
to 1
the 1
singular 1
case 1
of 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
well 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
small 1
matter 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
innocent 1
category 1
you 1
know 1
peterson 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
this 1
trophy 1
belongs 1
it 1
is 1
his 1
hat 1
no 1
no 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
its 1
owner 1
is 1
unknown 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
look 1
upon 1
it 1
not 1
as 1
a 1
battered 1
billycock 1
but 1
as 1
an 1
intellectual 1
problem 1
and 1
first 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
it 1
came 1
here 1
it 1
arrived 1
upon 1
christmas 1
morning 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
fat 1
goose 1
which 1
is 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
roasting 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
petersons 1
fire 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
these 1
about 1
four 1
oclock 1
on 1
christmas 1
morning 1
peterson 1
who 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
honest 1
fellow 1
was 1
returning 1
from 1
some 1
small 1
jollification 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
his 1
way 1
homeward 1
down 1
tottenham 1
court 1
road 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
gaslight 1
a 1
tallish 1
man 1
walking 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
stagger 1
and 1
carrying 1
a 1
white 1
goose 1
slung 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
as 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
goodge 1
street 1
a 1
row 1
broke 1
out 1
between 1
this 1
stranger 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
roughs 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
knocked 1
off 1
the 1
mans 1
hat 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
stick 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
and 1
swinging 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
smashed 1
the 1
shop 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
peterson 1
had 1
rushed 1
forward 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
stranger 1
from 1
his 1
assailants 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
shocked 1
at 1
having 1
broken 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
seeing 1
an 1
officiallooking 1
person 1
in 1
uniform 1
rushing 1
towards 1
him 1
dropped 1
his 1
goose 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
vanished 1
amid 1
the 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
small 1
streets 1
which 1
lie 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
tottenham 1
court 1
road 1
the 1
roughs 1
had 1
also 1
fled 1
at 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
peterson 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
left 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
battle 1
and 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
spoils 1
of 1
victory 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
this 1
battered 1
hat 1
and 1
a 1
most 1
unimpeachable 1
christmas 1
goose 1
which 1
surely 1
he 1
restored 1
to 1
their 1
owner 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
there 1
lies 1
the 1
problem 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
for 1
mrs 1
henry 1
baker 1
was 1
printed 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
card 1
which 1
was 1
tied 1
to 1
the 1
birds 1
left 1
leg 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
initials 1
h 1
b 1
are 1
legible 1
upon 1
the 1
lining 1
of 1
this 1
hat 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
thousands 1
of 1
bakers 1
and 1
some 1
hundreds 1
of 1
henry 1
bakers 1
in 1
this 1
city 1
of 1
ours 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
easy 1
to 1
restore 1
lost 1
property 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
what 1
then 1
did 1
peterson 1
do 1
he 1
brought 1
round 1
both 1
hat 1
and 1
goose 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
christmas 1
morning 1
knowing 1
that 1
even 1
the 1
smallest 1
problems 1
are 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
goose 1
we 1
retained 1
until 1
this 1
morning 1
when 1
there 1
were 1
signs 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
slight 1
frost 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
eaten 1
without 1
unnecessary 1
delay 1
its 1
finder 1
has 1
carried 1
it 1
off 1
therefore 1
to 1
fulfil 1
the 1
ultimate 1
destiny 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
while 1
i 1
continue 1
to 1
retain 1
the 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
unknown 1
gentleman 1
who 1
lost 1
his 1
christmas 1
dinner 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
advertise 1
no 1
then 1
what 1
clue 1
could 1
you 1
have 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
identity 1
only 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
deduce 1
from 1
his 1
hat 1
precisely 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
joking 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
this 1
old 1
battered 1
felt 1
here 1
is 1
my 1
lens 1
you 1
know 1
my 1
methods 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
gather 1
yourself 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
individuality 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
worn 1
this 1
article 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
tattered 1
object 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
rather 1
ruefully 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
ordinary 1
black 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
usual 1
round 1
shape 1
hard 1
and 1
much 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
wear 1
the 1
lining 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
red 1
silk 1
but 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
discoloured 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
makers 1
name 1
but 1
as 1
holmes 1
had 1
remarked 1
the 1
initials 1
h 1
b 1
were 1
scrawled 1
upon 1
one 1
side 1
it 1
was 1
pierced 1
in 1
the 1
brim 1
for 1
a 1
hatsecurer 1
but 1
the 1
elastic 1
was 1
missing 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
it 1
was 1
cracked 1
exceedingly 1
dusty 1
and 1
spotted 1
in 1
several 1
places 1
although 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
attempt 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
discoloured 1
patches 1
by 1
smearing 1
them 1
with 1
ink 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
nothing 1
said 1
i 1
handing 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
watson 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
everything 1
you 1
fail 1
however 1
to 1
reason 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
see 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
timid 1
in 1
drawing 1
your 1
inferences 1
then 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
infer 1
from 1
this 1
hat 1
he 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
peculiar 1
introspective 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
characteristic 1
of 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
perhaps 1
less 1
suggestive 1
than 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
he 1
remarked 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
are 1
a 1
few 1
inferences 1
which 1
are 1
very 1
distinct 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
others 1
which 1
represent 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
strong 1
balance 1
of 1
probability 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
highly 1
intellectual 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
obvious 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
fairly 1
welltodo 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
years 1
although 1
he 1
has 1
now 1
fallen 1
upon 1
evil 1
days 1
he 1
had 1
foresight 1
but 1
has 1
less 1
now 1
than 1
formerly 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
moral 1
retrogression 1
which 1
when 1
taken 1
with 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
seems 1
to 1
indicate 1
some 1
evil 1
influence 1
probably 1
drink 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
him 1
this 1
may 1
account 1
also 1
for 1
the 1
obvious 1
fact 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes 1
he 1
has 1
however 1
retained 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
selfrespect 1
he 1
continued 1
disregarding 1
my 1
remonstrance 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
leads 1
a 1
sedentary 1
life 1
goes 1
out 1
little 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
training 1
entirely 1
is 1
middleaged 1
has 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
had 1
cut 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
anoints 1
with 1
limecream 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
patent 1
facts 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
deduced 1
from 1
his 1
hat 1
also 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
extremely 1
improbable 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
gas 1
laid 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
you 1
are 1
certainly 1
joking 1
holmes 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
these 1
results 1
you 1
are 1
unable 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
they 1
are 1
attained 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
stupid 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
unable 1
to 1
follow 1
you 1
for 1
example 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
deduce 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
was 1
intellectual 1
for 1
answer 1
holmes 1
clapped 1
the 1
hat 1
upon 1
his 1
head 1
it 1
came 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
forehead 1
and 1
settled 1
upon 1
the 1
bridge 1
of 1
his 1
nose 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
cubic 1
capacity 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
brain 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
then 1
this 1
hat 1
is 1
three 1
years 1
old 1
these 1
flat 1
brims 1
curled 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
came 1
in 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
best 1
quality 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
band 1
of 1
ribbed 1
silk 1
and 1
the 1
excellent 1
lining 1
if 1
this 1
man 1
could 1
afford 1
to 1
buy 1
so 1
expensive 1
a 1
hat 1
three 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
has 1
had 1
no 1
hat 1
since 1
then 1
he 1
has 1
assuredly 1
gone 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
clear 1
enough 1
certainly 1
but 1
how 1
about 1
the 1
foresight 1
and 1
the 1
moral 1
retrogression 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
laughed 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
foresight 1
said 1
he 1
putting 1
his 1
finger 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
disc 1
and 1
loop 1
of 1
the 1
hatsecurer 1
they 1
are 1
never 1
sold 1
upon 1
hats 1
if 1
this 1
man 1
ordered 1
one 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
amount 1
of 1
foresight 1
since 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
take 1
this 1
precaution 1
against 1
the 1
wind 1
but 1
since 1
we 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
broken 1
the 1
elastic 1
and 1
has 1
not 1
troubled 1
to 1
replace 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
less 1
foresight 1
now 1
than 1
formerly 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
proof 1
of 1
a 1
weakening 1
nature 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
has 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
conceal 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
stains 1
upon 1
the 1
felt 1
by 1
daubing 1
them 1
with 1
ink 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
entirely 1
lost 1
his 1
selfrespect 1
your 1
reasoning 1
is 1
certainly 1
plausible 1
the 1
further 1
points 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
middleaged 1
that 1
his 1
hair 1
is 1
grizzled 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
recently 1
cut 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
uses 1
limecream 1
are 1
all 1
to 1
be 1
gathered 1
from 1
a 1
close 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
lining 1
the 1
lens 1
discloses 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
of 1
hairends 1
clean 1
cut 1
by 1
the 1
scissors 1
of 1
the 1
barber 1
they 1
all 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
adhesive 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
odour 1
of 1
limecream 1
this 1
dust 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
gritty 1
grey 1
dust 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
the 1
fluffy 1
brown 1
dust 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
showing 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
hung 1
up 1
indoors 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
while 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
moisture 1
upon 1
the 1
inside 1
are 1
proof 1
positive 1
that 1
the 1
wearer 1
perspired 1
very 1
freely 1
and 1
could 1
therefore 1
hardly 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
training 1
but 1
his 1
wifeyou 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
this 1
hat 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
brushed 1
for 1
weeks 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
watson 1
with 1
a 1
weeks 1
accumulation 1
of 1
dust 1
upon 1
your 1
hat 1
and 1
when 1
your 1
wife 1
allows 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
state 1
i 1
shall 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
also 1
have 1
been 1
unfortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
lose 1
your 1
wifes 1
affection 1
but 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
bachelor 1
nay 1
he 1
was 1
bringing 1
home 1
the 1
goose 1
as 1
a 1
peaceoffering 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
remember 1
the 1
card 1
upon 1
the 1
birds 1
leg 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
everything 1
but 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
that 1
the 1
gas 1
is 1
not 1
laid 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
one 1
tallow 1
stain 1
or 1
even 1
two 1
might 1
come 1
by 1
chance 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
five 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
little 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
individual 1
must 1
be 1
brought 1
into 1
frequent 1
contact 1
with 1
burning 1
tallowwalks 1
upstairs 1
at 1
night 1
probably 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
guttering 1
candle 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
anyhow 1
he 1
never 1
got 1
tallowstains 1
from 1
a 1
gasjet 1
are 1
you 1
satisfied 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
ingenious 1
said 1
i 1
laughing 1
but 1
since 1
as 1
you 1
said 1
just 1
now 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
crime 1
committed 1
and 1
no 1
harm 1
done 1
save 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
all 1
this 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
rather 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
energy 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
opened 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
reply 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
peterson 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
apartment 1
with 1
flushed 1
cheeks 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
dazed 1
with 1
astonishment 1
the 1
goose 1
mr 1
holmes 1
the 1
goose 1
sir 1
he 1
gasped 1
eh 1
what 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
has 1
it 1
returned 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
flapped 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
kitchen 1
window 1
holmes 1
twisted 1
himself 1
round 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
fairer 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
mans 1
excited 1
face 1
see 1
here 1
sir 1
see 1
what 1
my 1
wife 1
found 1
in 1
its 1
crop 1
he 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
displayed 1
upon 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
palm 1
a 1
brilliantly 1
scintillating 1
blue 1
stone 1
rather 1
smaller 1
than 1
a 1
bean 1
in 1
size 1
but 1
of 1
such 1
purity 1
and 1
radiance 1
that 1
it 1
twinkled 1
like 1
an 1
electric 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
hollow 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
whistle 1
by 1
jove 1
peterson 1
said 1
he 1
this 1
is 1
treasure 1
trove 1
indeed 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
diamond 1
sir 1
a 1
precious 1
stone 1
it 1
cuts 1
into 1
glass 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
putty 1
its 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
precious 1
stone 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
precious 1
stone 1
not 1
the 1
countess 1
of 1
morcars 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
i 1
ejaculated 1
precisely 1
so 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
know 1
its 1
size 1
and 1
shape 1
seeing 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
advertisement 1
about 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
times 1
every 1
day 1
lately 1
it 1
is 1
absolutely 1
unique 1
and 1
its 1
value 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
conjectured 1
but 1
the 1
reward 1
offered 1
of 1
1000 1
pounds 1
is 1
certainly 1
not 1
within 1
a 1
twentieth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
price 1
a 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
great 1
lord 1
of 1
mercy 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
plumped 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
stared 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reward 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
sentimental 1
considerations 1
in 1
the 1
background 1
which 1
would 1
induce 1
the 1
countess 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
half 1
her 1
fortune 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
but 1
recover 1
the 1
gem 1
it 1
was 1
lost 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
aright 1
at 1
the 1
hotel 1
cosmopolitan 1
i 1
remarked 1
precisely 1
so 1
on 1
december 1
22nd 1
just 1
five 1
days 1
ago 1
john 1
horner 1
a 1
plumber 1
was 1
accused 1
of 1
having 1
abstracted 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
ladys 1
jewelcase 1
the 1
evidence 1
against 1
him 1
was 1
so 1
strong 1
that 1
the 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
referred 1
to 1
the 1
assizes 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
here 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
rummaged 1
amid 1
his 1
newspapers 1
glancing 1
over 1
the 1
dates 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
smoothed 1
one 1
out 1
doubled 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
read 1
the 1
following 1
paragraph 1
