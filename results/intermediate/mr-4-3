blame 1
simple 1
there 1

it 1
whats 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
a 1
plan 1

no 1
more 1
trouble 1
than 1
that 1
its 1
as 1
mild 1
as 1
goosemilk 1
why 1
huck 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
talk 1
than 1
breaking 1
into 1
a 1
soap 1
factory 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
because 1
i 1
warnt 1
expecting 1
nothing 1
different 1
but 1
i 1
knowed 1
mighty 1
well 1
that 1
whenever 1
he 1
got 1
_his_ 1
plan 1
ready 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
objections 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
didnt 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
fifteen 1
of 1
mine 1
for 1
style 1
and 1
would 1
make 1
jim 1
just 1
as 1
free 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
mine 1
would 1
and 1
maybe 1
get 1
us 1
all 1
killed 1
besides 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
would 1
waltz 1
in 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
neednt 1
tell 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
because 1
i 1
knowed 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
stay 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
changing 1
it 1
around 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
and 1
heaving 1
in 1
new 1
bullinesses 1
wherever 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
done 1
well 1
one 1
thing 1
was 1
dead 1
sure 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
that 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
was 1
in 1
earnest 1
and 1
was 1
actuly 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
steal 1
that 1
nigger 1
out 1
of 1
slavery 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
was 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
that 1
was 1
respectable 1
and 1
well 1
brung 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
character 1
to 1
lose 1
and 1
folks 1
at 1
home 1
that 1
had 1
characters 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
not 1
leatherheaded 1
and 1
knowing 1
and 1
not 1
ignorant 1
and 1
not 1
mean 1
but 1
kind 1
and 1
yet 1
here 1
he 1
was 1
without 1
any 1
more 1
pride 1
or 1
rightness 1
or 1
feeling 1
than 1
to 1
stoop 1
to 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
make 1
himself 1
a 1
shame 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
a 1
shame 1
before 1
everybody 1
i 1
_couldnt_ 1
understand 1
it 1
no 1
way 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
was 1
outrageous 1
and 1
i 1
knowed 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
just 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
be 1
his 1

at 1
the 1
dime 1
and 1
bite 1

if 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
he 1
whispers 1
to 1
jim 1
and 1
says 1
dont 1
ever 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
us 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
hear 1
any 1
digging 1
going 1
on 1
nights 1
its 1
us 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
jim 1
only 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
grab 1
us 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
squeeze 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
nigger 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
we 1
said 1
wed 1
come 1
again 1
some 1
time 1
if 1
the 1
nigger 1
wanted 1
us 1
to 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
more 1
particular 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
because 1
the 1
witches 1
went 1
for 1
him 1
mostly 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
to 1
have 1
folks 1
around 1
then 1
chapter 1
xxxv 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
an 1
hour 1
yet 1
till 1
breakfast 1
so 1
we 1
left 1
and 1
struck 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
because 1
tom 1
said 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
_some_ 1
light 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
to 1
dig 1
by 1
and 1
a 1
lantern 1
makes 1
too 1
much 1
and 1
might 1
get 1
us 1
into 1
trouble 1
what 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
was 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
rotten 1
chunks 1
thats 1
called 1
foxfire 1
and 1
just 1
makes 1
a 1
soft 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
glow 1
when 1
you 1
lay 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
place 1
we 1
fetched 1
an 1
armful 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
weeds 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
and 1
tom 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
dissatisfied 1
blame 1
it 1
this 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
awkward 1
as 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
makes 1
it 1
so 1
rotten 1
difficult 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
a 1
difficult 1
plan 1
there 1
aint 1
no 1
watchman 1
to 1
be 1
druggednow 1
there 1
_ought_ 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
watchman 1
there 1
aint 1
even 1
a 1
dog 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
sleepingmixture 1
to 1
and 1
theres 1
jim 1
chained 1
by 1

the 1
_prisoner_ 1
care 1
whose 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
there 1
because 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
breakfasthorn 1
blowing 1
so 1
we 1
cleared 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
along 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
borrowed 1
a 1
sheet 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
shirt 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
clothesline 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
sack 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
foxfire 1
and 1
put 1
that 1
in 1
too 1
i 1
called 1
it 1
borrowing 1
because 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
pap 1
always 1
called 1
it 1
but 1
tom 1
said 1
it 1
warnt 1
borrowing 1
it 1
was 1
stealing 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
was 1
representing 1
prisoners 1
and 1
prisoners 1
dont 1
care 1
how 1
they 1
get 1
a 1
thing 1
so 1
they 1
get 1
it 1
and 1
nobody 1
dont 1
blame 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
either 1
it 1
aint 1
no 1
crime 1
in 1
a 1
prisoner 1
to 1
steal 1
the 1
thing 1
he 1
needs 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
tom 1
said 1
its 1
his 1
right 1
and 1
so 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
was 1
representing 1
a 1
prisoner 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
perfect 1
right 1
to 1
steal 1
anything 1
on 1
this 1
place 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
least 1
use 1
for 1
to 1
get 1
ourselves 1
out 1
of 1
prison 1
with 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
warnt 1
prisoners 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
thing 1
and 1
nobody 1
but 1
a 1
mean 1
ornery 1
person 1
would 1
steal 1
when 1
he 1
warnt 1
a 1
prisoner 1
so 1
we 1
allowed 1
we 1
would 1
steal 1
everything 1
there 1

mighty 1
fuss 1
one 1
day 1
after 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
stole 1
a 1
watermelon 1
out 1

the 1
niggerpatch 1
and 1

he 1
made 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
niggers 1
a 1
dime 1
without 1
telling 1
them 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
tom 1
said 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
meant 1
was 1
we 1
could 1
steal 1
anything 1
we 1
_needed_ 1
well 1
i 1
says 1
i 1
needed 1
the 1
watermelon 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
didnt 1
need 1
it 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
prison 1
with 1
theres 1
where 1
the 1
difference 1
was 1
he 1

smuggle 1

the 1
seneskal 1

that 1
though 1

advantage 1
in 1
my 1
representing 1

got 1
to 1
set 1
down 1

chaw 1
over 1
a 1
lot 1

himself 1
out 1
that 1
way 1
how 1
long 1
was 1
_he_ 1
at 1
it 1
you 1
reckon 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
well 1
guess 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
_thirtyseven 1
year_and 1
he 1
come 1
out 1
in 1
china 1
_thats_ 1
the 1
kind 1
i 1
wish 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
_this_ 1
fortress 1
was 1
solid 1
rock 1
_jim_ 1
dont 1
know 1
nobody 1
in 1
china 1
whats 1
_that_ 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
neither 1
did 1
that 1
other 1
fellow 1
but 1
youre 1
always 1
awandering 1
off 1
on 1
a 1
side 1
issue 1
why 1
cant 1
you 1
stick 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
point 1
all 1
righti 1
dont 1
care 1
where 1
he 1
comes 1
out 1
so 1
he 1
_comes_ 1
out 1
and 1
jim 1
dont 1
either 1
i 1
reckon 1
but 1
theres 1
one 1
thing 1
anywayjims 1
too 1
old 1
to 1
be 1
dug 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
caseknife 1
he 1
wont 1
last 1
yes 1
he 1
will 1
_last_ 1
too 1
you 1
dont 1
reckon 1
its 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
thirtyseven 1
years 1
to 1
dig 1
out 1
through 1
a 1
_dirt_ 1
foundation 1
do 1
you 1
how 1
long 1
will 1
it 1
take 1
tom 1
well 1
we 1
cant 1
resk 1
being 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
because 1
it 1
maynt 1
take 1
very 1
long 1
for 1
uncle 1
silas 1
to 1
hear 1
from 1
down 1
there 1
by 1
new 1
orleans 1
hell 1
hear 1
jim 1
aint 1
from 1
there 1
then 1
his 1
next 1
move 1
will 1
be 1
to 1
advertise 1
jim 1
or 1
something 1
like 1
that 1
so 1
we 1
cant 1
resk 1
being 1
as 1
long 1
digging 1
him 1
out 1
as 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
by 1
rights 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
but 1
we 1
cant 1
things 1
being 1
so 1
uncertain 1
what 1
i 1
recommend 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
we 1
really 1
dig 1
right 1
in 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
_let 1
on_ 1
to 1
ourselves 1
that 1
we 1
was 1
at 1
it 1
thirtyseven 1
years 1
then 1
we 1
can 1
snatch 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
rush 1
him 1
away 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
theres 1
an 1
alarm 1
yes 1
i 1
reckon 1
that 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
now 1
theres 1
_sense_ 1
in 1
that 1
i 1
says 1
letting 1
on 1
dont 1
cost 1
nothing 1
letting 1
on 1
aint 1
no 1
trouble 1
and 1
if 1
its 1
any 1
object 1
i 1
dont 1
mind 1
letting 1
on 1
we 1
was 1
at 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
year 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
strain 1
me 1
none 1
after 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
so 1
ill 1
mosey 1
along 1
now 1
and 1
smouch 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
caseknives 1
smouch 1
three 1
he 1
says 1
we 1
want 1
one 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
saw 1
out 1
of 1
tom 1
if 1
it 1
aint 1
unregular 1
and 1
irreligious 1
to 1
sejest 1
it 1
i 1
says 1
theres 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
sawblade 1
around 1
yonder 1
sticking 1
under 1
the 1
weatherboarding 1
behind 1
the 1
smokehouse 1
he 1
looked 1
kind 1
of 1
weary 1
and 1
discouragedlike 1
and 1
says 1

out 1
our 1
pile 1
of 1
foxfire 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1

cleared 1
everything 1

wrong 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
aint 1
got 1
no 1
business 1
doing 1
wrong 1
when 1
he 1
aint 1
ignorant 1
and 1

it 1
might 1
answer 1
for 1
_you_ 1
to 1
dig 1
jim 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
pick 1
_without_ 1
any 1
letting 1
on 1
because 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
no 1
better 1
but 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
i 1
do 1
know 1
better 1
gimme 1
a 1
caseknife 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
by 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
handed 1
him 1
mine 1
he 1
flung 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
says 1
gimme 1
a 1
_caseknife_ 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
just 1
what 1
to 1
dobut 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
scratched 1
around 1
amongst 1
the 1
old 1
tools 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
pickaxe 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
just 1
that 1
particular 1
full 1
of 1
principle 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
shovel 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
picked 1
and 1
shoveled 1
turn 1
about 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
fur 1
fly 1
we 1
stuck 1
to 1
it 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
stand 1
up 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
a 1
hole 1
to 1
show 1
for 1
it 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
up 1
stairs 1
i 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
see 1
tom 1
doing 1
his 1

tom 1
was 1
satisfied 1
then 1
he 1
says 1

says 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
it 1
done 1
he 1
only 1
just 1
looked 1
scornful 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
about 1
nobody 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
such 1
an 1
idiotic 1
idea 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
studying 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
ciphered 1
out 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
ways 1
but 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
decide 1
on 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
yet 1
said 1
wed 1
got 1
to 1
post 1
jim 1
first 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
lightningrod 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
ten 1
and 1
took 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
candles 1
along 1
and 1
listened 1
under 1
the 1
windowhole 1
and 1
heard 1
jim 1
snoring 1
so 1
we 1
pitched 1
it 1
in 1
and 1
it 1
didnt 1
wake 1
him 1
then 1
we 1
whirled 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
pick 1
and 1
shovel 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
two 1
hours 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
done 1
we 1
crept 1
in 1
under 1
jims 1
bed 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
pawed 1
around 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
lit 1
it 1
and 1
stood 1
over 1
jim 1
awhile 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
looking 1
hearty 1
and 1
healthy 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
woke 1
him 1
up 1
gentle 1
and 1
gradual 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
us 1
he 1
most 1
cried 1
and 1
called 1
us 1
honey 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
pet 1
names 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
was 1
for 1
having 1
us 1
hunt 1
up 1
a 1
coldchisel 1
to 1
cut 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
leg 1
with 1
right 1
away 1
and 1
clearing 1
out 1
without 1
losing 1
any 1
time 1
but 1
tom 1
he 1
showed 1
him 1
how 1
unregular 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
about 1
our 1
plans 1
and 1
how 1
we 1
could 1
alter 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
any 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
alarm 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
least 1
afraid 1
because 1
we 1
would 1
see 1
he 1
got 1
away 1
_sure_ 1
so 1
jim 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
talked 1
over 1
old 1
times 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
tom 1
asked 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
questions 1
and 1
when 1
jim 1
told 1
him 1
uncle 1
silas 1
come 1
in 1
every 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
to 1
pray 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
aunt 1
sally 1
come 1
in 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
comfortable 1
and 1
had 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
kind 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
be 1
tom 1
says 1
_now_ 1
i 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
well 1
send 1
you 1
some 1
things 1
by 1
them 1
i 1
said 1
dont 1
do 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
its 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
jackass 1
ideas 1
i 1
ever 1
struck 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
paid 1
no 1
attention 1
to 1
me 1
went 1
right 1
on 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
way 1
when 1
hed 1
got 1
his 1
plans 1
set 1
so 1
he 1
told 1
jim 1
how 1
wed 1
have 1
to 1
smuggle 1
in 1
the 1
ropeladder 1
pie 1
and 1
other 1
large 1
things 1
by 1
nat 1
the 1
nigger 1
that 1
fed 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
and 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
and 1
not 1
let 1
nat 1
see 1
him 1
open 1
them 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
put 1
small 1
things 1
in 1
uncles 1
coatpockets 1
and 1
he 1
must 1
steal 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
tie 1
things 1
to 1
aunts 1
apronstrings 1
or 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
apronpocket 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
was 1
for 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
journal 1
on 1
the 1
shirt 1
with 1
his 1
blood 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
jim 1
he 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
sense 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
allowed 1
we 1
was 1
white 1
folks 1
and 1
knowed 1
better 1
than 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
tom 1
said 1
jim 1
had 1
plenty 1
corncob 1
pipes 1
and 1
tobacco 1
so 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
down 1
good 1
sociable 1
time 1
then 1
we 1
crawled 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
so 1
home 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
hands 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
theyd 1
been 1
chawed 1
tom 1
was 1
in 1
high 1
spirits 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
fun 1
he 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
intellectural 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
only 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
it 1
we 1
would 1
keep 1
it 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
and 1
leave 1
jim 1
to 1
our 1
children 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
for 1
he 1
believed 1
jim 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
like 1
it 1
better 1
and 1
better 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
strung 1
out 1
to 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
eighty 1
year 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
time 1
on 1
record 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
us 1
all 1
celebrated 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1

sizes 1
and 1
tom 1
put 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
pewter 1
spoon 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
then 1

red 1
and 1
cross 1
and 1
couldnt 1
hardly 1
wait 1

the 1
blessing 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
sluicing 1
out 1
coffee 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
cracking 1
the 1
handiest 1
childs 1

beat 1
all 1
what 1
_has_ 1
become 1
of 1
your 1
other 1
shirt 1
my 1
heart 1
fell 1
down 1
amongst 1
my 1
lungs 1
and 1
livers 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
a 1
hard 1
piece 1
of 1

down 1
my 1
throat 1
after 1

on 1
the 1
road 1
with 1
a 1
cough 1

of 1
a 1
warwhoop 1
and 1
tom 1
he 1
turned 1
kinder 1
blue 1
around 1
the 1
gills 1
and 1
it 1
all 1
amounted 1
to 1
a 1
considerable 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
as 1
much 1
as 1

settingroom 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
shinglenail 1
fell 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
he 1
just 1
merely 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
and 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
tom 1
see 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
remembered 1
about 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
says 1
well 1
it 1
aint 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
send 1
things 1
by 1
_him_ 1
no 1
more 1
he 1
aint 1
reliable 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
but 1
he 1
done 1
us 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
with 1
the 1
spoon 1
anyway 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
well 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
him 1
one 1
without 1
_him_ 1
knowing 1
itstop 1
up 1
his 1
ratholes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
noble 1
good 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
down 1
cellar 1
and 1
it 1
took 1
us 1
a 1
whole 1
hour 1
but 1
we 1
done 1
the 1
job 1
tight 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
shipshape 1
then 1
we 1
heard 1
steps 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
blowed 1
out 1
our 1
light 1
and 1
hid 1
and 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
stuff 1
in 1
tother 1
looking 1
as 1
absentminded 1
as 1
year 1
before 1
last 1
he 1
went 1
a 1
mooning 1
around 1
first 1
to 1
one 1
rathole 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
till 1
hed 1
been 1
to 1
them 1
all 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
picking 1
tallowdrip 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
candle 1
and 1
thinking 1
then 1
he 1
turns 1
off 1
slow 1
and 1
dreamy 1
towards 1
the 1
stairs 1
saying 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
cant 1
remember 1
when 1
i 1
done 1
it 1
i 1
could 1
show 1
her 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
warnt 1
to 1
blame 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
rats 1
but 1

mindlet 1
it 1

reckon 1

went 1
on 1
amumbling 1
up 1

it 1
in 1
her 1
apronpocket 1
whilst 1
she 1
was 1
agiving 1
us 1
our 1
sailing 1
orders 1
and 1
jim 1
got 1
it 1
all 1
right 1
along 1
with 1
her 1
shingle 1
nail 1
before 1
noon 1
we 1
was 1
very 1
well 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
tom 1
allowed 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
twice 1
the 1
trouble 1
it 1
took 1
because 1
he 1
said 1
_now_ 1
she 1
couldnt 1
ever 1
count 1
them 1
spoons 1
twice 1
alike 1
again 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
wouldnt 1
believe 1
shed 1
counted 1
them 1
right 1
if 1
she 1
_did_ 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
after 1
shed 1
about 1
counted 1
her 1
head 1
off 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
judged 1
shed 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
offer 1
to 1
kill 1
anybody 1
that 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
ever 1
count 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
so 1
we 1
put 1
the 1
sheet 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
line 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
stole 1
one 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
closet 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
putting 1
it 1
back 1
and 1
stealing 1
it 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
days 1
till 1
she 1
didnt 1
know 1
how 1
many 1
sheets 1
she 1
had 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
she 1
didnt 1
_care_ 1
and 1
warnt 1
agoing 1
to 1
bullyrag 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1
out 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
wouldnt 1
count 1
them 1
again 1
not 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
life 1
she 1
druther 1
die 1
first 1
so 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
shirt 1
and 1
the 1
sheet 1
and 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
the 1
candles 1
by 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
the 1
rats 1
and 1
the 1
mixedup 1
counting 1
and 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
candlestick 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
consequence 1
it 1
would 1
blow 1
over 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
but 1
that 1
pie 1
was 1
a 1
job 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
trouble 1
with 1
that 1
pie 1
we 1
fixed 1
it 1
up 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
cooked 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
done 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
too 1
but 1
not 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
up 1
three 1
washpans 1
full 1
of 1
flour 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
through 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
burnt 1
pretty 1
much 1
all 1
over 1
in 1
places 1
and 1
eyes 1
put 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
smoke 1
because 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
didnt 1
want 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
crust 1
and 1
we 1
couldnt 1
prop 1
it 1
up 1
right 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
always 1
cave 1
in 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
right 1
way 1
at 1
lastwhich 1
was 1
to 1
cook 1
the 1
ladder 1
too 1
in 1
the 1
pie 1
so 1
then 1
we 1
laid 1
in 1
with 1
jim 1
the 1
second 1
night 1
and 1
tore 1
up 1
the 1
sheet 1
all 1
in 1
little 1
strings 1
and 1
twisted 1
them 1
together 1
and 1
long 1
before 1
daylight 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
lovely 1
rope 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
hung 1
a 1
person 1
with 1
we 1
let 1
on 1
it 1
took 1
nine 1
months 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
forenoon 1
we 1
took 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
pie 1
being 1
made 1
of 1
a 1
whole 1
sheet 1
that 1
way 1
there 1
was 1
rope 1
enough 1
for 1
forty 1
pies 1
if 1
wed 1
a 1
wanted 1
them 1
and 1
plenty 1
left 1
over 1
for 1
soup 1
or 1
sausage 1
or 1
anything 1
you 1
choose 1
we 1
could 1
a 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
dinner 1
but 1
we 1
didnt 1
need 1
it 1
all 1
we 1
needed 1
was 1
just 1
enough 1
for 1
the 1
pie 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
throwed 1
the 1
rest 1
away 1
we 1
didnt 1
cook 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
pies 1
in 1
the 1
washpanafraid 1
the 1
solder 1
would 1
melt 1
but 1
uncle 1
silas 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
noble 1
brass 1
warmingpan 1
which 1
he 1
thought 1
considerable 1
of 1
because 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
ancesters 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
wooden 1
handle 1
that 1
come 1
over 1
from 1
england 1
with 1
william 1
the 1
conqueror 1
in 1
the 1
mayflower 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
early 1
ships 1
and 1
was 1
hid 1
away 1
up 1
garret 1
with 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
old 1
pots 1
and 1
things 1
that 1
was 1
valuable 1
not 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
being 1
any 1
account 1
because 1
they 1
warnt 1
but 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
them 1
being 1
relicts 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
we 1
snaked 1
her 1
out 1
private 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
down 1
there 1
but 1
she 1
failed 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
pies 1
because 1
we 1
didnt 1
know 1
how 1
but 1
she 1
come 1
up 1
smiling 1
on 1
the 1
last 1
one 1
we 1
took 1
and 1
lined 1
her 1
with 1
dough 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
coals 1
and 1
loaded 1
her 1
up 1
with 1
rag 1
rope 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
dough 1
roof 1
and 1
shut 1
down 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
put 1
hot 1
embers 1
on 1
top 1
and 1
stood 1
off 1
five 1
foot 1
with 1
the 1
long 1
handle 1
cool 1
and 1
comfortable 1
and 1
in 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
she 1
turned 1
out 1
a 1
pie 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
but 1
the 1
person 1
that 1
et 1
it 1
would 1
want 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
kags 1
of 1
toothpicks 1
along 1
for 1
if 1
that 1
rope 1
ladder 1
wouldnt 1
cramp 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
business 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
nothing 1
what 1
im 1
talking 1
about 1
and 1
lay 1
him 1
in 1
enough 1
stomachache 1
to 1
last 1
him 1
till 1
next 1
time 1

took 1
a 1
look 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
me 1
and 1
jim 1
was 1
getting 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
pens 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
pesky 1
tedious 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
slow 1
and 1
didnt 1
give 1
my 1
hands 1
no 1
show 1
to 1
get 1
well 1
of 1
the 1
sores 1
and 1
we 1
didnt 1
seem 1
to 1
make 1
no 1
headway 1
hardly 1
so 1
tom 1
says 1
i 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rock 1
for 1
the 1
coat 1
of 1
arms 1
and 1
mournful 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
kill 1
two 1
birds 1
with 1
that 1
same 1
rock 1
theres 1
a 1
gaudy 1
big 1
grindstone 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
well 1
smouch 1
it 1
and 1
carve 1
the 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
file 1
out 1
the 1
pens 1
and 1
the 1
saw 1
on 1
it 1
too 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
slouch 1
of 1
an 1
idea 1
and 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
slouch 1
of 1
a 1
grindstone 1
nuther 1
but 1
we 1
allowed 1
wed 1
tackle 1
it 1
it 1
warnt 1
quite 1
midnight 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
cleared 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
mill 1
leaving 1
jim 1
at 1
work 1
we 1
smouched 1
the 1
grindstone 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
roll 1
her 1
home 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
nation 1
tough 1
job 1
sometimes 1
do 1
what 1
we 1
could 1
we 1
couldnt 1
keep 1
her 1
from 1
falling 1
over 1
and 1
she 1
come 1
mighty 1
near 1
mashing 1
us 1
every 1
time 1
tom 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
sure 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
through 1
we 1
got 1
her 1
half 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
was 1
plumb 1
played 1
out 1
and 1
most 1
drownded 1
with 1
sweat 1
we 1
see 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
fetch 1
jim 1
so 1
he 1
raised 1
up 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
slid 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
bedleg 1
and 1
wrapt 1
it 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
we 1
crawled 1
out 1
through 1
our 1
hole 1
and 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
jim 1
and 1
me 1
laid 1
into 1
that 1
grindstone 1
and 1
walked 1
her 1
along 1
like 1

and 1
tom 1
superintended 1
he 1

outsuperintend 1
any 1
boy 1
i 1

see 1
he 1
knowed 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
our 1
hole 1
was 1
pretty 1
big 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
grindstone 1
through 1
but 1
jim 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pick 1
and 1
soon 1
made 1
it 1
big 1
enough 1
then 1
tom 1
marked 1
out 1
them 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
nail 1
and 1
set 1
jim 1
to 1

with 1
the 1
nail 1
for 1
a 1
chisel 1
and 1
an 1

till 1
the 1
rest 1

and 1
hide 1
the 1
grindstone 1
under 1
his 1
straw 1
tick 1

things 1
which 1
made 1
it 1
more 1
trouble 1
and 1
worry 1
and 1
responsibility 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
prisoner 1
than 1
anything 1
he 1
ever 1
undertook 1
that 1
tom 1
most 1
lost 1
all 1
patience 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
loadened 1
down 1
with 1
more 1
gaudier 1
chances 1
than 1
a 1
prisoner 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
name 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
didnt 1
know 1
enough 1
to 1
appreciate 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
was 1
just 1
about 1
wasted 1
on 1
him 1
so 1
jim 1
he 1
was 1
sorry 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
behave 1
so 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
me 1
and 1
tom 1
shoved 1
for 1
bed 1

wire 1
rattrap 1
and 1
fetched 1

best 1
rathole 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
had 1
fifteen 1
of 1
the 1
bulliest 1
kind 1
of 1
ones 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
safe 1
place 1
under 1
aunt 1
sallys 1
bed 1
but 1
while 1
we 1
was 1

for 1
spiders 1
little 1
thomas 1
franklin 1
benjamin 1
jefferson 1
elexander 1
phelps 1
found 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
rats 1
would 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
they 1
did 1
and 1
aunt 1
sally 1
she 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
back 1
she 1
was 1
astanding 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
raising 1
cain 1
and 1
the 1
rats 1
was 1
doing 1
what 1
they 1
could 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
dull 1
times 1
for 1
her 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
and 1
dusted 1
us 1
both 1
with 1
the 1
hickry 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
two 1
hours 1
catching 1
another 1
fifteen 1
or 1
sixteen 1
drat 1
that 1
meddlesome 1
cub 1
and 1
they 1
warnt 1
the 1
likeliest 1
nuther 1
because 1
the 1
first 1
haul 1
was 1
the 1
pick 1
of 1
the 1
flock 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
likelier 1
lot 1
of 1
rats 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
first 1
haul 1
was 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
splendid 1
stock 1
of 1
sorted 1
spiders 1
and 1
bugs 1
and 1
frogs 1
and 1
caterpillars 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
we 1
like 1
to 1
got 1
a 1
hornets 1
nest 1
but 1
we 1
didnt 1
the 1
family 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
we 1
didnt 1
give 1
it 1
right 1
up 1
but 1
stayed 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
because 1
we 1
allowed 1
wed 1
tire 1
them 1
out 1
or 1
theyd 1
got 1
to 1
tire 1
us 1
out 1
and 1
they 1
done 1
it 1
then 1
we 1
got 1
allycumpain 1
and 1
rubbed 1
on 1
the 1
places 1
and 1
was 1
pretty 1
near 1
all 1
right 1
again 1
but 1
couldnt 1
set 1
down 1
convenient 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
grabbed 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
dozen 1
garters 1
and 1
housesnakes 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
bag 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
our 1
room 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
suppertime 1
and 1
a 1
rattling 1
good 1
honest 1
days 1
work 1
and 1
hungryoh 1
no 1
i 1
reckon 1
not 1
and 1
there 1
warnt 1
a 1
blessed 1
snake 1
up 1
there 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
backwe 1
didnt 1
half 1
tie 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
they 1
worked 1
out 1
somehow 1
and 1
left 1
but 1
it 1
didnt 1
matter 1
much 1
because 1
they 1
was 1
still 1
on 1
the 1
premises 1
somewheres 1
so 1
we 1
judged 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
again 1
no 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
real 1
scarcity 1
of 1
snakes 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
considerable 1
spell 1
youd 1
see 1
them 1
dripping 1
from 1
the 1
rafters 1
and 1
places 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
they 1
generly 1
landed 1
in 1
your 1
plate 1
or 1
down 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
your 1
neck 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
where 1
you 1
didnt 1
want 1
them 1
well 1
they 1
was 1
handsome 1
and 1
striped 1
and 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
harm 1
in 1
a 1
million 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
that 1
never 1
made 1
no 1
difference 1
to 1
aunt 1
sally 1
she 1
despised 1
snakes 1
be 1
the 1
breed 1
what 1
they 1
might 1
and 1
she 1
couldnt 1
stand 1
them 1
no 1
way 1
you 1
could 1
fix 1
it 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
flopped 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
it 1
didnt 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
she 1
would 1
just 1
lay 1
that 1
work 1
down 1
and 1
light 1
out 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
woman 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
whoop 1
to 1
jericho 1
you 1
couldnt 1
get 1
her 1
to 1
take 1
aholt 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
turned 1
over 1
and 1
found 1
one 1
in 1
bed 1
she 1
would 1
scramble 1
out 1
and 1
lift 1
a 1
howl 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
think 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
afire 1
she 1
disturbed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
most 1
wish 1
there 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
been 1
no 1
snakes 1
created 1
why 1
after 1
every 1
last 1
snake 1
had 1
been 1
gone 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
week 1
aunt 1
sally 1
warnt 1
over 1
it 1
yet 1
she 1
warnt 1
near 1
over 1
it 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
setting 1
thinking 1
about 1
something 1
you 1
could 1
touch 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
her 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
feather 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
jump 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
stockings 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
curious 1
but 1
tom 1
said 1
all 1
women 1
was 1
just 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
that 1
way 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
or 1
other 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
licking 1
every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
snakes 1
come 1
in 1
her 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
allowed 1
these 1
lickings 1
warnt 1
nothing 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
if 1
we 1
ever 1
loaded 1
up 1
the 1
place 1
again 1
with 1
them 1
i 1
didnt 1
mind 1
the 1
lickings 1
because 1
they 1
didnt 1
amount 1
to 1
nothing 1
but 1
i 1
minded 1
the 1
trouble 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
lay 1
in 1
another 1
lot 1
but 1
we 1
got 1
them 1
laid 1
in 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
cabin 1
as 1
blithesome 1
as 1
jims 1
was 1
when 1
theyd 1
all 1
swarm 1
out 1
for 1
music 1
and 1
go 1
for 1
him 1
jim 1
didnt 1
like 1
the 1
spiders 1
and 1
the 1
spiders 1
didnt 1
like 1
jim 1
and 1
so 1
theyd 1
lay 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
make 1
it 1
mighty 1
warm 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
between 1
the 1
rats 1
and 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
the 1
grindstone 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
room 1
in 1
bed 1
for 1
him 1
skasely 1
and 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
body 1
couldnt 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
lively 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
lively 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
_they_ 1
never 1
all 1
slept 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
but 1
took 1
turn 1
about 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
snakes 1
was 1
asleep 1
the 1
rats 1
was 1
on 1
deck 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
rats 1
turned 1
in 1
the 1
snakes 1
come 1
on 1
watch 1
so 1
he 1
always 1
had 1
one 1
gang 1
under 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
tother 1
gang 1
having 1
a 1
circus 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
to 1
hunt 1
a 1
new 1
place 1
the 1
spiders 1
would 1
take 1
a 1
chance 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
crossed 1
over 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
ever 1
got 1
out 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
ever 1
be 1
a 1
prisoner 1
again 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
salary 1
well 1
by 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
weeks 1
everything 1
was 1
in 1
pretty 1
good 1
shape 1
the 1
shirt 1
was 1
sent 1
in 1
early 1
in 1
a 1
pie 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
a 1
rat 1
bit 1
jim 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
write 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
his 1
journal 1
whilst 1
the 1
ink 1
was 1
fresh 1
the 1
pens 1
was 1
made 1
the 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
was 1
all 1
carved 1
on 1
the 1
grindstone 1
the 1
bedleg 1
was 1
sawed 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
et 1
up 1
the 1
sawdust 1
and 1
it 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
most 1
amazing 1
stomachache 1
we 1
reckoned 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
but 1
didnt 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
undigestible 1
sawdust 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
tom 1
said 1
the 1
same 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
saying 1
wed 1
got 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
done 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
pretty 1
much 1
fagged 1
out 1
too 1
but 1
mainly 1
jim 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
wrote 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
to 1
the 1
plantation 1
below 1
orleans 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
get 1
their 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
but 1
hadnt 1
got 1
no 1
answer 1
because 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
such 1
plantation 1
so 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
advertise 1
jim 1
in 1
the 1
st 1
louis 1
and 1
new 1
orleans 1

and 1
when 1
he 1
mentioned 1
the 1
st 1
louis 1
ones 1
it 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
cold 1
shivers 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
we 1
hadnt 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
lose 1
so 1
tom 1
said 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
nonnamous 1
letters 1
whats 1
them 1
i 1
says 1
warnings 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
something 1
is 1
up 1
sometimes 1
its 1
done 1
one 1
way 1
sometimes 1
another 1
but 1
theres 1
always 1
somebody 1
spying 1
around 1
that 1
gives 1
notice 1
to 1
the 1
governor 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
when 1
louis 1
xvi 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
light 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tooleries 1
a 1
servantgirl 1
done 1
it 1
its 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
is 1
the 1
nonnamous 1
letters 1
well 1
use 1
them 1
both 1
and 1
its 1
usual 1
for 1
the 1
prisoners 1
mother 1
to 1
change 1
clothes 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
she 1
stays 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
slides 1
out 1
in 1
her 1
clothes 1
well 1
do 1
that 1
too 1
but 1

just 1
unfurled 1
our 1
heels 1
and 1
shoved 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
and 1
a 1
_bang 1
bang 1
bang_ 1
and 1
the 1
bullets 1
fairly 1
whizzed 1
around 1

broke 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
after 1
em 1
boys 1

the 1
dogs 1
so 1
here 1
they 1
come 1
full 1
tilt 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
because 1
they 1
wore 1
boots 1
and 1
yelled 1
but 1
we 1
didnt 1
wear 1
no 1
boots 1
and 1
didnt 1
yell 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
pretty 1
close 1
on 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
dodged 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
by 1
and 1
then 1
dropped 1
in 1
behind 1
them 1
theyd 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
dogs 1
shut 1
up 1
so 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
scare 1
off 1
the 1
robbers 1
but 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
somebody 1
had 1
let 1
them 1
loose 1
and 1
here 1
they 1
come 1
making 1
powwow 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
million 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
our 1
dogs 1
so 1
we 1
stopped 1
in 1
our 1
tracks 1
till 1
they 1
catched 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
see 1
it 1
warnt 1
nobody 1
but 1
us 1
and 1
no 1
excitement 1
to 1
offer 1
them 1
they 1
only 1
just 1
said 1
howdy 1
and 1
tore 1
right 1
ahead 1
towards 1
the 1
shouting 1
and 1
clattering 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
upsteam 1
again 1
and 1
whizzed 1
along 1
after 1
them 1
till 1
we 1
was 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
then 1
struck 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
bush 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
canoe 1
was 1
tied 1
and 1
hopped 1
in 1
and 1
pulled 1
for 1
dear 1
life 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
didnt 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
noise 1
than 1
we 1
was 1
obleeged 1
to 1
then 1
we 1
struck 1
out 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
for 1
the 1
island 1
where 1
my 1
raft 1
was 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
yelling 1
and 1
barking 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
all 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
till 1
we 1
was 1

fix 1
it 1
and 1
not 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
nor 1

know 1
because 1

evening 1
and 1
surprise 1
the 1
folks 1
who 1
is 1

he 1
lit 1
up 1
his 1
lantern 1
and 1
got 1
his 1
saddlebags 1
and 1
we 1
started 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
the 1
canoe 1
he 1
didnt 1
like 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
hersaid 1
she 1
was 1
big 1
enough 1
for 1
one 1
but 1
didnt 1
look 1
pretty 1
safe 1
for 1
two 1
i 1
says 1
oh 1

neednt 1

andandand 1
_the 1
guns_ 1

he 1
put 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
gunnel 1
and 1
rocked 1
her 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1

look 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
bigger 1
one 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
all 1
locked 1
and 1
chained 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
my 1
canoe 1
and 1
said 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
wait 1
till 1
he 1
come 1
back 1
or 1
i 1
could 1
hunt 1
around 1
further 1
or 1
maybe 1
i 1
better 1
go 1
down 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
them 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
surprise 1
if 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1

the 1
raft 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
started 1

suffering 1
or 1
dead 1
and 1
she 1
not 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
tears 1
would 1
drip 1
down 1
silent 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
tell 1
her 1
that 1
sid 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
sure 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
squeeze 1
my 1
hand 1
or 1
maybe 1
kiss 1
me 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
keep 1
on 1
saying 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
done 1
her 1
good 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
and 1
when 1

looked 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
so 1

and 1
gentle 1
and 1

jim 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
me 1
and 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
cabin 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
own 1
clothes 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
chained 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
no 1
bedleg 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
to 1
a 1
big 1
staple 1
drove 1
into 1
the 1
bottom 1
log 1
and 1
chained 1
his 1
hands 1
too 1
and 1
both 1
legs 1
and 1

he 1
warnt 1
to 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
bread 1
and 1
water 1
to 1
eat 1
after 1
this 1
till 1
his 1
owner 1
come 1
or 1
he 1
was 1
sold 1
at 1
auction 1
because 1
he 1
didnt 1
come 1
in 1
a 1
certain 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
filled 1
up 1
our 1
hole 1
and 1
said 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
farmers 1
with 1
guns 1
must 1
stand 1
watch 1
around 1
about 1
the 1
cabin 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
a 1
bulldog 1
tied 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
and 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
was 1
through 1
with 1
the 1
job 1
and 1
was 1
tapering 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
generl 1
goodbye 1
cussing 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
doctor 1
comes 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
says 1
dont 1
be 1
no 1
rougher 1
on 1
him 1
than 1
youre 1
obleeged 1
to 1
because 1
he 1
aint 1
a 1
bad 1
nigger 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
where 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
boy 1
i 1
see 1
i 1
couldnt 1
cut 1
the 1
bullet 1
out 1
without 1
some 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
warnt 1
in 1
no 1
condition 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
get 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
worse 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
worse 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
wouldnt 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
anigh 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
i 1
chalked 1
his 1
raft 1
hed 1
kill 1
me 1
and 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
wild 1
foolishness 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
i 1
couldnt 1
do 1
anything 1
at 1
all 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
i 1
says 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
_help_ 1
somehow 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
i 1
says 1
it 1
out 1
crawls 1
this 1
nigger 1
from 1
somewheres 1
and 1
says 1
hell 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
too 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
very 1
well 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
judged 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
_was_ 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
right 1
straight 1
along 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
all 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fix 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
patients 1
with 1
the 1
chills 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
id 1
of 1
liked 1
to 1
run 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
see 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
dasnt 1
because 1
the 1
nigger 1
might 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
id 1
be 1
to 1
blame 1
and 1
yet 1
never 1
a 1
skiff 1
come 1
close 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
hail 1
so 1
there 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
plumb 1
until 1
daylight 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
nigger 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
better 1
nuss 1
or 1
faithfuller 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
was 1
risking 1
his 1
freedom 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
all 1
tired 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
plain 1
enough 1
hed 1
been 1
worked 1
main 1
hard 1
lately 1
i 1
liked 1
the 1
nigger 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
a 1
nigger 1
like 1
that 1
is 1
worth 1
a 1
thousand 1
dollarsand 1
kind 1
treatment 1
too 1
i 1
had 1
everything 1
i 1
needed 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
doing 1
as 1
well 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
done 1
at 1
homebetter 1
maybe 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
but 1
there 1
i 1
_was_ 1
with 1
both 1
of 1
m 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
till 1
about 1
dawn 1
this 1
morning 1
then 1
some 1
men 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
come 1
by 1
and 1
as 1
good 1
luck 1
would 1
have 1
it 1
the 1
nigger 1
was 1
setting 1
by 1
the 1
pallet 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
propped 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
sound 1
asleep 1
so 1
i 1
motioned 1
them 1
in 1
quiet 1
and 1
they 1
slipped 1
up 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
grabbed 1
him 1
and 1
tied 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
knowed 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
and 1
we 1
never 1
had 1
no 1
trouble 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
being 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
flighty 1
sleep 1
too 1
we 1
muffled 1
the 1
oars 1
and 1
hitched 1
the 1
raft 1
on 1
and 1
towed 1
her 1
over 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
the 1
nigger 1
never 1
made 1
the 1
least 1
row 1
nor 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
he 1
aint 1
no 1
bad 1
nigger 1
gentlemen 1
thats 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
about 1
him 1
somebody 1
says 1
well 1
it 1
sounds 1
very 1
good 1
doctor 1
im 1
obleeged 1
to 1
say 1
then 1
the 1
others 1
softened 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
mighty 1
thankful 1
to 1
that 1
old 1
doctor 1
for 1
doing 1
jim 1
that 1
good 1
turn 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
it 1
was 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
judgment 1
of 1
him 1
too 1
because 1
i 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
heart 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
agreed 1
that 1
jim 1
had 1
acted 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
was 1
deserving 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
notice 1
took 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
reward 1
so 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
promised 1
right 1
out 1
and 1
hearty 1
that 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
cuss 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
then 1
they 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
locked 1
him 1
up 1
i 1
hoped 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
chains 1
took 1
off 1
because 1
they 1
was 1
rotten 1
heavy 1
or 1
could 1
have 1
meat 1
and 1
greens 1
with 1
his 1
bread 1
and 1
water 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
reckoned 1
it 1
warnt 1
best 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
mix 1
in 1
but 1
i 1
judged 1
id 1
get 1
the 1
doctors 1
yarn 1
to 1
aunt 1
sally 1
somehow 1
or 1
other 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
id 1
got 1
through 1
the 1
breakers 1
that 1
was 1
laying 1
just 1
ahead 1
of 1
meexplanations 1
i 1
mean 1
of 1
how 1
i 1
forgot 1
to 1
mention 1
about 1
sid 1
being 1
shot 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
telling 1
how 1
him 1
and 1
me 1
put 1
in 1
that 1
dratted 1
night 1
paddling 1
around 1
hunting 1
the 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
plenty 1
time 1
aunt 1
sally 1
she 1
stuck 1
to 1
the 1
sickroom 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
see 1
uncle 1
silas 1
mooning 1
around 1
i 1
dodged 1
him 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
heard 1
tom 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
better 1
and 1
they 1
said 1
aunt 1
sally 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
nap 1
so 1
i 1
slips 1
to 1
the 1
sickroom 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
found 1
him 1
awake 1
i 1
reckoned 1
we 1
could 1
put 1
up 1
a 1
yarn 1
for 1
the 1
family 1
that 1
would 1
wash 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
sleeping 1
and 1
sleeping 1
very 1
peaceful 1
too 1
and 1
pale 1
not 1
firefaced 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
was 1
when 1
he 1
come 1
so 1
i 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
laid 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
wake 1
in 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
aunt 1
sally 1

gliding 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
was 1
up 1
a 1
stump 1
again 1

motioned 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
still 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
by 1
me 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
whisper 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
could 1
all 1
be 1
joyful 1
now 1
because 1

time 1
and 1
ten 1
to 1
one 1
hed 1

in 1
his 1
right 1
mind 1
so 1
we 1
set 1
there 1
watching 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
stirs 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
very 1
natural 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1

free 1
nigger 1
free 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1

that 1
minute 1
and 1
that 1

free 1
with 1
his 1
bringingup 1
well 1

that 1
when 1
aunt 1

to 1
her 1
that 1
tom 1
and 1
_sid_ 1

she 1
says 1

expected 1
it 1
letting 1
him 1

off 1
that 1
way 1
without 1
anybody 1

watch 1
him 1
so 1

seem 1
to 1

why 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
nothing 1
from 1
you 1
says 1
aunt 1
sally 1

by 1
sid 1
being 1

i 1
never 1

em 1
sis 1

polly 1
she 1
turns 1
around 1
slow 1
and 1
severe 1
and 1
says 1
you 1
tom 1
well_what_ 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
pettish 1
dont 1
you 1
what 1
_me_ 1
you 1
impudent 1
thinghand 1
out 1
them 1
letters 1
what 1
letters 1
_them_ 1
letters 1
i 1
be 1
bound 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
aholt 1
of 1
you 1
ill 1
theyre 1
in 1
the 1
trunk 1
there 1
now 1
and 1
theyre 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
they 1
was 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
i 1
haint 1
looked 1
into 1
them 1
i 1
haint 1
touched 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
knowed 1
theyd 1
make 1
trouble 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
if 1
you 1
warnt 1
in 1
no 1
hurry 1
id 1
well 1
you 1
_do_ 1
need 1
skinning 1
there 1

that 1
one 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
offer 1
to 1
bet 1
two 1
dollars 1
she 1
hadnt 1
but 1
i 1
reckoned 1
maybe 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
safe 1
to 1
not 1
to 1
so 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
chapter 1
the 1
last 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
catched 1
tom 1
private 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
was 1
his 1
idea 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
evasionwhat 1
it 1
was 1
hed 1
planned 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
the 1
evasion 1
worked 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
managed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
nigger 1
free 1
that 1
was 1
already 1
free 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
planned 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
jim 1
out 1
all 1
safe 1
was 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
run 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
have 1
adventures 1
plumb 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
then 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
his 1
being 1
free 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
back 1
up 1
home 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
in 1
style 1
and 1
pay 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
time 1
and 1
write 1
word 1
ahead 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
niggers 1
around 1
and 1
have 1
them 1
waltz 1
him 1
into 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
torchlight 1
procession 1
and 1
a 1
brassband 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
hero 1
and 1
so 1
would 1
we 1
but 1
i 1
reckoned 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
as 1
well 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
we 1
had 1
jim 1
out 1

the 1
doctor 1
nurse 1
tom 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
fuss 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
fixed 1
him 1
up 1

and 1
give 1
him 1
all 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sickroom 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
high 1
talk 1
and 1
tom 1
give 1
jim 1
forty 1
dollars 1
for 1
being 1
prisoner 1
for 1
us 1
so 1
patient 1
and 1
doing 1
it 1
up 1
so 1
