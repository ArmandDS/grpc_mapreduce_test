breath 1
upon 1
their 1
cheeks 1
and 1
shuddered 1
with 1
the 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
pause 1
now 1
a 1
weird 1
flash 1
turned 1
night 1
into 1
day 1
and 1
showed 1
every 1
little 1
grassblade 1
separate 1
and 1
distinct 1
that 1
grew 1
about 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
it 1
showed 1
three 1
white 1
startled 1
faces 1
too 1
a 1
deep 1
peal 1
of 1
thunder 1
went 1
rolling 1
and 1
tumbling 1
down 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
lost 1
itself 1
in 1
sullen 1
rumblings 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
a 1
sweep 1
of 1
chilly 1
air 1
passed 1
by 1
rustling 1
all 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
snowing 1
the 1
flaky 1
ashes 1
broadcast 1
about 1
the 1
fire 1
another 1
fierce 1
glare 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
an 1
instant 1
crash 1
followed 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
rend 1
the 1
treetops 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
boys 1
heads 1
they 1
clung 1
together 1
in 1
terror 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
gloom 1
that 1
followed 1
a 1
few 1
big 1
raindrops 1
fell 1
pattering 1
upon 1
the 1
leaves 1
quick 1
boys 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
tent 1
exclaimed 1
tom 1
they 1
sprang 1
away 1
stumbling 1
over 1
roots 1
and 1
among 1
vines 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
no 1
two 1
plunging 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
direction 1
a 1
furious 1
blast 1
roared 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
making 1
everything 1
sing 1
as 1
it 1
went 1
one 1
blinding 1
flash 1
after 1
another 1
came 1
and 1
peal 1
on 1
peal 1
of 1
deafening 1
thunder 1
and 1
now 1
a 1
drenching 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
rising 1
hurricane 1
drove 1
it 1
in 1
sheets 1
along 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
boys 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
but 1
the 1
roaring 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
booming 1
thunderblasts 1
drowned 1
their 1
voices 1
utterly 1
however 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
they 1
straggled 1
in 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
took 1
shelter 1
under 1
the 1
tent 1
cold 1
scared 1
and 1
streaming 1
with 1
water 1
but 1
to 1
have 1
company 1
in 1
misery 1
seemed 1
something 1
to 1
be 1
grateful 1
for 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
talk 1
the 1
old 1
sail 1
flapped 1
so 1
furiously 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
other 1
noises 1
would 1
have 1
allowed 1
them 1
the 1
tempest 1
rose 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
sail 1
tore 1
loose 1
from 1
its 1
fastenings 1
and 1
went 1
winging 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
blast 1
the 1
boys 1
seized 1
each 1
others 1
hands 1
and 1
fled 1
with 1
many 1
tumblings 1
and 1
bruises 1
to 1
the 1
shelter 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
oak 1
that 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
riverbank 1
now 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
at 1
its 1
highest 1
under 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
conflagration 1
of 1
lightning 1
that 1
flamed 1
in 1
the 1
skies 1
everything 1
below 1
stood 1
out 1
in 1
cleancut 1
and 1
shadowless 1
distinctness 1
the 1
bending 1
trees 1
the 1
billowy 1
river 1
white 1
with 1
foam 1
the 1
driving 1
spray 1
of 1
spumeflakes 1
the 1
dim 1
outlines 1
of 1
the 1
high 1
bluffs 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
glimpsed 1
through 1
the 1
drifting 1
cloudrack 1
and 1
the 1
slanting 1
veil 1
of 1
rain 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
some 1
giant 1
tree 1
yielded 1
the 1
fight 1
and 1
fell 1
crashing 1
through 1
the 1
younger 1
growth 1
and 1
the 1
unflagging 1
thunderpeals 1
came 1
now 1
in 1
earsplitting 1
explosive 1
bursts 1
keen 1
and 1
sharp 1
and 1
unspeakably 1
appalling 1
the 1
storm 1
culminated 1
in 1
one 1
matchless 1
effort 1
that 1
seemed 1
likely 1
to 1
tear 1
the 1
island 1
to 1
pieces 1
burn 1
it 1
up 1
drown 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
treetops 1
blow 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
deafen 1
every 1
creature 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
at 1
one 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
night 1
for 1
homeless 1
young 1
heads 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
in 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
forces 1
retired 1
with 1
weaker 1
and 1
weaker 1
threatenings 1
and 1
grumblings 1
and 1
peace 1
resumed 1
her 1
sway 1
the 1
boys 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
awed 1
but 1
they 1
found 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
something 1
to 1
be 1
thankful 1
for 1
because 1
the 1
great 1
sycamore 1
the 1
shelter 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
was 1
a 1
ruin 1
now 1
blasted 1
by 1
the 1
lightnings 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
under 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
catastrophe 1
happened 1
everything 1
in 1
camp 1
was 1
drenched 1
the 1
campfire 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
but 1
heedless 1
lads 1
like 1
their 1
generation 1
and 1
had 1
made 1
no 1
provision 1
against 1
rain 1
here 1
was 1
matter 1
for 1
dismay 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
soaked 1
through 1
and 1
chilled 1
they 1
were 1
eloquent 1
in 1
their 1
distress 1
but 1
they 1
presently 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
fire 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
far 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
great 1
log 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
built 1
against 1
where 1
it 1
curved 1
upward 1
and 1
separated 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
a 1
handbreadth 1
or 1
so 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
escaped 1
wetting 1
so 1
they 1
patiently 1
wrought 1
until 1
with 1
shreds 1
and 1
bark 1
gathered 1
from 1
the 1
under 1
sides 1
of 1
sheltered 1
logs 1
they 1
coaxed 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
burn 1
again 1
then 1
they 1
piled 1
on 1
great 1
dead 1
boughs 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
roaring 1
furnace 1
and 1
were 1
gladhearted 1
once 1
more 1
they 1
dried 1
their 1
boiled 1
ham 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
feast 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
expanded 1
and 1
glorified 1
their 1
midnight 1
adventure 1
until 1
morning 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
dry 1
spot 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
anywhere 1
around 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
boys 1
drowsiness 1
came 1
over 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
sandbar 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
they 1
got 1
scorched 1
out 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
drearily 1
set 1
about 1
getting 1
breakfast 1
after 1
the 1
meal 1
they 1
felt 1
rusty 1
and 1
stiffjointed 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
homesick 1
once 1
more 1
tom 1
saw 1
the 1
signs 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
cheering 1
up 1
the 1
pirates 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
they 1
cared 1
nothing 1
for 1
marbles 1
or 1
circus 1
or 1
swimming 1
or 1
anything 1
he 1
reminded 1
them 1
of 1
the 1
imposing 1
secret 1
and 1
raised 1
a 1
ray 1
of 1
cheer 1
while 1
it 1
lasted 1
he 1
got 1
them 1
interested 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
device 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
knock 1
off 1
being 1
pirates 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
be 1
indians 1
for 1
a 1
change 1
they 1
were 1
attracted 1
by 1
this 1
idea 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
were 1
stripped 1
and 1
striped 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
heel 1
with 1
black 1
mud 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
zebrasall 1
of 1
them 1
chiefs 1
of 1
courseand 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
tearing 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
attack 1
an 1
english 1
settlement 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
separated 1
into 1
three 1
hostile 1
tribes 1
and 1
darted 1
upon 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
ambush 1
with 1
dreadful 1
warwhoops 1
and 1
killed 1
and 1
scalped 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
thousands 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
gory 1
day 1
consequently 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extremely 1
satisfactory 1
one 1
they 1
assembled 1
in 1
camp 1
toward 1
suppertime 1
hungry 1
and 1
happy 1
but 1
now 1
a 1
difficulty 1
arosehostile 1
indians 1
could 1
not 1
break 1
the 1
bread 1
of 1
hospitality 1
together 1
without 1
first 1
making 1
peace 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
simple 1
impossibility 1
without 1
smoking 1
a 1
pipe 1
of 1
peace 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
process 1
that 1
ever 1
they 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
almost 1
wished 1
they 1
had 1
remained 1
pirates 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
so 1
with 1
such 1
show 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
muster 1
they 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
pipe 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
whiff 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
in 1
due 1
form 1
and 1
behold 1
they 1
were 1
glad 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
into 1
savagery 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
gained 1
something 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
now 1
smoke 1
a 1
little 1
without 1
having 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
a 1
lost 1
knife 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
sick 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
seriously 1
uncomfortable 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
fool 1
away 1
this 1
high 1
promise 1
for 1
lack 1
of 1
effort 1
no 1
they 1
practised 1
cautiously 1
after 1
supper 1
with 1
right 1
fair 1
success 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
spent 1
a 1
jubilant 1
evening 1
they 1
were 1
prouder 1
and 1
happier 1
in 1
their 1
new 1
acquirement 1
than 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
scalping 1
and 1
skinning 1
of 1
the 1
six 1
nations 1
we 1
will 1
leave 1
them 1
to 1
smoke 1
and 1
chatter 1
and 1
brag 1
since 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
further 1
use 1
for 1
them 1
at 1
present 1
chapter 1
xvii 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
hilarity 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
that 1
same 1
tranquil 1
saturday 1
afternoon 1
the 1
harpers 1
and 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
family 1
were 1
being 1
put 1
into 1
mourning 1
with 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
many 1
tears 1
an 1
unusual 1
quiet 1
possessed 1
the 1
village 1
although 1
it 1
was 1
ordinarily 1
quiet 1
enough 1
in 1
all 1
conscience 1
the 1
villagers 1
conducted 1
their 1
concerns 1
with 1
an 1
absent 1
air 1
and 1
talked 1
little 1
but 1
they 1
sighed 1
often 1
the 1
saturday 1
holiday 1
seemed 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
the 1
children 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
heart 1
in 1
their 1
sports 1
and 1
gradually 1
gave 1
them 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
found 1
herself 1
moping 1
about 1
the 1
deserted 1
schoolhouse 1
yard 1
and 1
feeling 1
very 1
melancholy 1
but 1
she 1
found 1
nothing 1
there 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
she 1
soliloquized 1
oh 1
if 1
i 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
brass 1
andironknob 1
again 1
but 1
i 1
havent 1
got 1
anything 1
now 1
to 1
remember 1
him 1
by 1
and 1
she 1
choked 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
sob 1
presently 1
she 1
stopped 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
it 1
was 1
right 1
here 1
oh 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
over 1
again 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
thati 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
but 1
hes 1
gone 1
now 1
ill 1
never 1
never 1
never 1
see 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
this 1
thought 1
broke 1
her 1
down 1
and 1
she 1
wandered 1
away 1
with 1
tears 1
rolling 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
then 1
quite 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girlsplaymates 1
of 1
toms 1
and 1
joescame 1
by 1
and 1
stood 1
looking 1
over 1
the 1
paling 1
fence 1
and 1
talking 1
in 1
reverent 1
tones 1
of 1
how 1
tom 1
did 1
soandso 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
and 1
how 1
joe 1
said 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
small 1
trifle 1
pregnant 1
with 1
awful 1
prophecy 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
easily 1
see 1
nowand 1
each 1
speaker 1
pointed 1
out 1
the 1
exact 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
lost 1
lads 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
something 1
like 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
astanding 1
just 1
sojust 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
himi 1
was 1
as 1
close 1
as 1
thatand 1
he 1
smiled 1
just 1
this 1
wayand 1
then 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
go 1
all 1
over 1
me 1
likeawful 1
you 1
knowand 1
i 1
never 1
thought 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
now 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dispute 1
about 1
who 1
saw 1
the 1
dead 1
boys 1
last 1
in 1
life 1
and 1
many 1
claimed 1
that 1
dismal 1
distinction 1
and 1
offered 1
evidences 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
tampered 1
with 1
by 1
the 1
witness 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ultimately 1
decided 1
who 1
_did_ 1
see 1
the 1
departed 1
last 1
and 1
exchanged 1
the 1
last 1
words 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
lucky 1
parties 1
took 1
upon 1
themselves 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sacred 1
importance 1
and 1
were 1
gaped 1
at 1
and 1
envied 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
one 1
poor 1
chap 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
other 1
grandeur 1
to 1
offer 1
said 1
with 1
tolerably 1
manifest 1
pride 1
in 1
the 1
remembrance 1
well 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
he 1
licked 1
me 1
once 1
but 1
that 1
bid 1
for 1
glory 1
was 1
a 1
failure 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
say 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
cheapened 1
the 1
distinction 1
too 1
much 1
the 1
group 1
loitered 1
away 1
still 1
recalling 1
memories 1
of 1
the 1
lost 1
heroes 1
in 1
awed 1
voices 1
when 1
the 1
sundayschool 1
hour 1
was 1
finished 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
bell 1
began 1
to 1
toll 1
instead 1
of 1
ringing 1
in 1
the 1
usual 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
still 1
sabbath 1
and 1
the 1
mournful 1
sound 1
seemed 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
the 1
musing 1
hush 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
nature 1
the 1
villagers 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
loitering 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
vestibule 1
to 1
converse 1
in 1
whispers 1
about 1
the 1
sad 1
event 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
whispering 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
only 1
the 1
funereal 1
rustling 1
of 1
dresses 1
as 1
the 1
women 1
gathered 1
to 1
their 1
seats 1
disturbed 1
the 1
silence 1
there 1
none 1
could 1
remember 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
church 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
full 1
before 1
there 1
was 1
finally 1
a 1
waiting 1
pause 1
an 1
expectant 1
dumbness 1
and 1
then 1
aunt 1
polly 1
entered 1
followed 1
by 1
sid 1
and 1
mary 1
and 1
they 1
by 1
the 1
harper 1
family 1
all 1
in 1
deep 1
black 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
congregation 1
the 1
old 1
minister 1
as 1
well 1
rose 1
reverently 1
and 1
stood 1
until 1
the 1
mourners 1
were 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
pew 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
communing 1
silence 1
broken 1
at 1
intervals 1
by 1
muffled 1
sobs 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
minister 1
spread 1
his 1
hands 1
abroad 1
and 1
prayed 1
a 1
moving 1
hymn 1
was 1
sung 1
and 1
the 1
text 1
followed 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
resurrection 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
as 1
the 1
service 1
proceeded 1
the 1
clergyman 1
drew 1
such 1
pictures 1
of 1
the 1
graces 1
the 1
winning 1
ways 1
and 1
the 1
rare 1
promise 1
of 1
the 1
lost 1
lads 1
that 1
every 1
soul 1
there 1
thinking 1
he 1
recognized 1
these 1
pictures 1
felt 1
a 1
pang 1
in 1
remembering 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
persistently 1
blinded 1
himself 1
to 1
them 1
always 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
as 1
persistently 1
seen 1
only 1
faults 1
and 1
flaws 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
boys 1
the 1
minister 1
related 1
many 1
a 1
touching 1
incident 1
in 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
the 1
departed 1
too 1
which 1
illustrated 1
their 1
sweet 1
generous 1
natures 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
could 1
easily 1
see 1
now 1
how 1
noble 1
and 1
beautiful 1
those 1
episodes 1
were 1
and 1
remembered 1
with 1
grief 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
they 1
occurred 1
they 1
had 1
seemed 1
rank 1
rascalities 1
well 1
deserving 1
of 1
the 1
cowhide 1
the 1
congregation 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
moved 1
as 1
the 1
pathetic 1
tale 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
whole 1
company 1
broke 1
down 1
and 1
joined 1
the 1
weeping 1
mourners 1
in 1
a 1
chorus 1
of 1
anguished 1
sobs 1
the 1
preacher 1
himself 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
his 1
feelings 1
and 1
crying 1
in 1
the 1
pulpit 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rustle 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
which 1
nobody 1
noticed 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
creaked 1
the 1
minister 1
raised 1
his 1
streaming 1
eyes 1
above 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
stood 1
transfixed 1
first 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
pair 1
of 1
eyes 1
followed 1
the 1
ministers 1
and 1
then 1
almost 1
with 1
one 1
impulse 1
the 1
congregation 1
rose 1
and 1
stared 1
while 1
the 1
three 1
dead 1
boys 1
came 1
marching 1
up 1
the 1
aisle 1
tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
joe 1
next 1
and 1
huck 1
a 1
ruin 1
of 1
drooping 1
rags 1
sneaking 1
sheepishly 1
in 1
the 1
rear 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
unused 1
gallery 1
listening 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
funeral 1
sermon 1
aunt 1
polly 1
mary 1
and 1
the 1
harpers 1
threw 1
themselves 1
upon 1
their 1
restored 1
ones 1
smothered 1
them 1
with 1
kisses 1
and 1
poured 1
out 1
thanksgivings 1
while 1
poor 1
huck 1
stood 1
abashed 1
and 1
uncomfortable 1
not 1
knowing 1
exactly 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
or 1
where 1
to 1
hide 1
from 1
so 1
many 1
unwelcoming 1
eyes 1
he 1
wavered 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
slink 1
away 1
but 1
tom 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
aunt 1
polly 1
it 1
aint 1
fair 1
somebodys 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
huck 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
shall 1
im 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
poor 1
motherless 1
thing 1
and 1
the 1
loving 1
attentions 1
aunt 1
polly 1
lavished 1
upon 1
him 1
were 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
capable 1
of 1
making 1
him 1
more 1
uncomfortable 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
suddenly 1
the 1
minister 1
shouted 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
praise 1
god 1
from 1
whom 1
all 1
blessings 1

put 1
your 1
hearts 1
in 1

triumphant 1
burst 1

while 1

tom 1

the 1

looked 1
around 1
upon 1
the 1
envying 1
juveniles 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
confessed 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
proudest 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
as 1
the 1
sold 1
congregation 1
trooped 1
out 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
almost 1
be 1
willing 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
ridiculous 1
again 1
to 1
hear 1

bed 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
sorry 1
that 1
i 1
took 1
and 1
wrote 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
sycamore 1
bark 1
we 1
aint 1
deadwe 1
are 1
only 1
off 1
being 1
pirates 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
by 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
looked 1
so 1
good 1
laying 1
there 1
asleep 1
that 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
went 1
and 1
leaned 1
over 1
and 1
kissed 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
lips 1
did 1
you 1
tom 1
_did_ 1
you 1
i 1
just 1
forgive 1
you 1
everything 1
for 1
that 1
and 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
a 1
crushing 1
embrace 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
like 1
the 1
guiltiest 1
of 1
villains 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
only 1

vanquish 1
her 1
realism 1
with 1
toms 1
marvellous 1
dream 1
sid 1
had 1
better 1
judgment 1
than 1
to 1
utter 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
pretty 1
thinas 1
long 1
a 1
dream 1
as 1
that 1
without 1
any 1
mistakes 1
in 1
it 1
what 1
a 1
hero 1
tom 1
was 1
become 1
now 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
skipping 1
and 1
prancing 1
but 1
moved 1
with 1
a 1
dignified 1
swagger 1
as 1
became 1
a 1
pirate 1
who 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
public 1
eye 1
was 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
tried 1
not 1
to 1
seem 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
looks 1
or 1
hear 1
the 1
remarks 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
him 1
smaller 1
boys 1
than 1
himself 1
flocked 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
as 1
proud 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
tolerated 1
by 1
him 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
drummer 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
procession 1
or 1
the 1
elephant 1
leading 1
a 1
menagerie 1
into 1
town 1
boys 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
size 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
consuming 1
with 1
envy 1
nevertheless 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
anything 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
swarthy 1
suntanned 1
skin 1
of 1
his 1
and 1
his 1
glittering 1
notoriety 1
and 1
tom 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
parted 1
with 1
either 1
for 1
a 1
circus 1
at 1
school 1
the 1
children 1
made 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
joe 1
and 1
delivered 1
such 1
eloquent 1
admiration 1
from 1
their 1
eyes 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
heroes 1
were 1
not 1
long 1
in 1
becoming 1
insufferably 1
stuckup 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
their 1
adventures 1
to 1
hungry 1
listenersbut 1
they 1
only 1
began 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
thing 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
end 1
with 1
imaginations 1
like 1
theirs 1
to 1
furnish 1
material 1
and 1
finally 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
their 1
pipes 1
and 1
went 1
serenely 1
puffing 1
around 1
the 1
very 1
summit 1
of 1
glory 1
was 1
reached 1
tom 1
decided 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
independent 1
of 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
now 1
glory 1
was 1
sufficient 1
he 1
would 1
live 1
for 1
glory 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
distinguished 1
maybe 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
well 1
let 1
hershe 1
should 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
as 1
indifferent 1
as 1
some 1
other 1
people 1
presently 1
she 1
arrived 1
tom 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
he 1
moved 1
away 1
and 1
joined 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
soon 1
he 1
observed 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
tripping 1
gayly 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
with 1
flushed 1
face 1
and 1
dancing 1
eyes 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
busy 1
chasing 1
schoolmates 1
and 1
screaming 1
with 1
laughter 1
when 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
capture 1
but 1
he 1
noticed 1
that 1
she 1
always 1
made 1
her 1
captures 1
in 1
his 1
vicinity 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
conscious 1
eye 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
at 1
such 1
times 1
too 1
it 1
gratified 1
all 1
the 1
vicious 1
vanity 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
instead 1
of 1
winning 1
him 1
it 1
only 1
set 1
him 1
up 1
the 1
more 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
the 1
more 1
diligent 1
to 1
avoid 1
betraying 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
presently 1
she 1
gave 1
over 1
skylarking 1
and 1
moved 1
irresolutely 1
about 1
sighing 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
and 1
glancing 1
furtively 1
and 1
wistfully 1
toward 1
tom 1
then 1
she 1
observed 1
that 1
now 1
tom 1
was 1
talking 1
more 1
particularly 1
to 1
amy 1
lawrence 1
than 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
she 1
felt 1
a 1
sharp 1
pang 1
and 1
grew 1
disturbed 1
and 1
uneasy 1
at 1
once 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
but 1
her 1
feet 1
were 1
treacherous 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
group 1
instead 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
a 1
girl 1
almost 1
at 1
toms 1
elbowwith 1
sham 1
vivacity 1
why 1

to 1

and 1
she 1
glanced 1
ever 1
so 1
furtively 1
at 1
tom 1
but 1
he 1
talked 1
right 1
along 1
to 1
amy 1
lawrence 1
about 1
the 1
terrible 1
storm 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
lightning 1
tore 1
the 1
great 1
sycamore 1
tree 1
all 1
to 1
flinders 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
within 1
three 1
feet 1
of 1
it 1
oh 1
may 1
i 1
come 1
said 1
grace 1
miller 1
yes 1
and 1
me 1
said 1
sally 1
rogers 1
yes 1
and 1
me 1
too 1
said 1
susy 1
harper 1
and 1
joe 1
yes 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
with 1
clapping 1
of 1
joyful 1
hands 1
till 1
all 1
the 1
group 1
had 1
begged 1
for 1
invitations 1
but 1
tom 1
and 1
amy 1
then 1
tom 1
turned 1
coolly 1
away 1
still 1
talking 1
and 1
took 1
amy 1
with 1
him 1
beckys 1
lips 1
trembled 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
eyes 1
she 1
hid 1
these 1
signs 1
with 1
a 1
forced 1
gayety 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
chattering 1
but 1
the 1
life 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
picnic 1
now 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
everything 1
else 1
she 1
got 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
hid 1
herself 1
and 1
had 1
what 1
her 1
sex 1
call 1
a 1
good 1
cry 1
then 1
she 1
sat 1
moody 1
with 1
wounded 1
pride 1
till 1
the 1
bell 1
rang 1
she 1
roused 1
up 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
vindictive 1
cast 1
in 1
her 1
eye 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
plaited 1
tails 1
a 1
shake 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
knew 1
what 1
_shed_ 1
do 1
at 1
recess 1
tom 1
continued 1
his 1
flirtation 1
with 1
amy 1
with 1
jubilant 1
selfsatisfaction 1
and 1
he 1
kept 1
drifting 1
about 1
to 1
find 1
becky 1
and 1
lacerate 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
performance 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
spied 1
her 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sudden 1
falling 1
of 1
his 1
mercury 1
she 1
was 1
sitting 1
cosily 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
bench 1
behind 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
looking 1
at 1
a 1
picturebook 1
with 1
alfred 1
templeand 1
so 1
absorbed 1
were 1
they 1
and 1
their 1
heads 1
so 1
close 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
book 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
conscious 1
of 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
besides 1
jealousy 1
ran 1
redhot 1
through 1
toms 1
veins 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
hate 1
himself 1
for 1
throwing 1
away 1
the 1
chance 1
becky 1
had 1
offered 1
for 1
a 1
reconciliation 1
he 1
called 1
himself 1
a 1
fool 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
hard 1
names 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
cry 1
with 1
vexation 1
amy 1
chatted 1
happily 1
along 1
as 1
they 1
walked 1
for 1
her 1
heart 1
was 1
singing 1
but 1
toms 1
tongue 1
had 1
lost 1
its 1
function 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
what 1
amy 1
was 1
saying 1
and 1
whenever 1
she 1
paused 1
expectantly 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
stammer 1
an 1
awkward 1
assent 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
often 1
misplaced 1
as 1
otherwise 1
he 1
kept 1
drifting 1
to 1
the 1
rear 1
of 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
to 1
sear 1
his 1
eyeballs 1
with 1
the 1
hateful 1
spectacle 1
there 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
maddened 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
never 1
once 1
suspected 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
see 1
nevertheless 1
and 1
she 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
winning 1
her 1
fight 1
too 1
and 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
suffer 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
amys 1
happy 1
prattle 1
became 1
intolerable 1
tom 1
hinted 1
at 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
things 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
time 1
was 1
fleeting 1
but 1
in 1
vainthe 1
girl 1
chirped 1
on 1
tom 1
thought 1
oh 1
hang 1
her 1
aint 1
i 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
attending 1
to 1
those 1
thingsand 1
she 1
said 1
artlessly 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
around 1
when 1
school 1
let 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
hastened 1
away 1
hating 1
her 1
for 1
it 1
any 1
other 1
boy 1
tom 1
thought 1
grating 1
his 1
teeth 1
any 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
but 1
that 1
saint 1
louis 1
smarty 1
that 1
thinks 1
he 1
dresses 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
is 1
aristocracy 1
oh 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
licked 1
you 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
you 1
ever 1
saw 1
this 1
town 1
mister 1
and 1
ill 1
lick 1
you 1
again 1
you 1
just 1
wait 1
till 1
i 1
catch 1
you 1
out 1
ill 1
just 1
take 1
and 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
through 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
thrashing 1
an 1
imaginary 1
boypummelling 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
kicking 1
and 1
gouging 1
oh 1
you 1
do 1
do 1
you 1
you 1
holler 1
nough 1
do 1
you 1
now 1
then 1
let 1
that 1
learn 1
you 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
imaginary 1
flogging 1
was 1
finished 1
to 1
his 1
satisfaction 1
tom 1
fled 1
home 1
at 1
noon 1
his 1
conscience 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
any 1
more 1
of 1
amys 1
grateful 1
happiness 1
and 1
his 1
jealousy 1
could 1
bear 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
distress 1
becky 1
resumed 1
her 1
picture 1
inspections 1
with 1
alfred 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
minutes 1
dragged 1
along 1
and 1
no 1
tom 1
came 1
to 1
suffer 1
her 1
triumph 1
began 1
to 1
cloud 1
and 1
she 1
lost 1
interest 1
gravity 1
and 1
absentmindedness 1
followed 1
and 1
then 1
melancholy 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
she 1
pricked 1
up 1
her 1
ear 1
at 1
a 1
footstep 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
hope 1
no 1
tom 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
grew 1
entirely 1
miserable 1
and 1
wished 1
she 1
hadnt 1
carried 1
it 1
so 1
far 1
when 1
poor 1
alfred 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
losing 1
her 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
kept 1
exclaiming 1
oh 1
heres 1
a 1
jolly 1
one 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
she 1
lost 1
patience 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
said 1
oh 1
dont 1
bother 1
me 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
walked 1
away 1
alfred 1
dropped 1
alongside 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
go 1
away 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
alone 1
cant 1
you 1
i 1
hate 1
you 1
so 1
the 1
boy 1
halted 1
wondering 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
donefor 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
look 1
at 1
pictures 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
nooningand 1
she 1
walked 1
on 1
crying 1
then 1
alfred 1
went 1
musing 1
into 1
the 1
deserted 1
schoolhouse 1
he 1
was 1
humiliated 1
and 1
angry 1
he 1
easily 1
guessed 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
truththe 1
girl 1
had 1
simply 1
made 1
a 1
convenience 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
vent 1
her 1
spite 1
upon 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
he 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
hating 1
tom 1
the 1
less 1
when 1
this 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
wished 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
boy 1
into 1
trouble 1
without 1
much 1
risk 1
to 1
himself 1
toms 1
spellingbook 1
fell 1
under 1
his 1
eye 1
here 1
was 1
his 1
opportunity 1
he 1
gratefully 1
opened 1
to 1
the 1
lesson 1
for 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
poured 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
page 1
becky 1
glancing 1
in 1
at 1
a 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
saw 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
without 1
discovering 1
herself 1
she 1
started 1
homeward 1
now 1
intending 1
to 1
find 1
tom 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
tom 1
would 1
be 1
thankful 1
and 1
their 1
troubles 1
would 1
be 1
healed 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
half 1
way 1
home 1
however 1
she 1
had 1
changed 1
her 1
mind 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
toms 1
treatment 1
of 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
talking 1
about 1
her 1
picnic 1
came 1
scorching 1
back 1
and 1
filled 1
her 1
with 1
shame 1
she 1
resolved 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
whipped 1
on 1
the 1
damaged 1
spellingbooks 1
account 1
and 1
to 1
hate 1
him 1
forever 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
chapter 1
xix 1
tom 1
arrived 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
dreary 1
mood 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
his 1
aunt 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
showed 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
his 1
sorrows 1
to 1
an 1
unpromising 1
market 1

this 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
his 1
smartness 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
tom 1
a 1
good 1
joke 1
before 1
and 1
very 1
ingenious 1
it 1
merely 1
looked 1
mean 1
and 1
shabby 1
now 1
he 1
hung 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
said 1

your 1

think 1
to 1
come 1
all 1
the 1
way 1

from 1
jacksons 1
island 1
in 1
the 1

fool 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
lie 1
about 1
a 1
dream 1
but 1
you 1

all 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
our 1
coming 1
and 1
hiding 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
somehow 1
bear 1
to 1

so 1
i 1
just 1

the 1
bark 1

in 1
my 1
pocket 1
and 1
kept 1
mum 1
what 1
bark 1
the 1
bark 1

up 1
when 1

do 1
honest 1
the 1
hard 1
lines 1
in 1
his 1
aunts 1
face 1
relaxed 1
and 1
a 1
sudden 1
tenderness 1
dawned 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
_did_ 1

tom 1
why 1
yes 1

there 1
moaning 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
sorry 1
the 1
words 1
sounded 1
like 1
truth 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
could 1
not 1
hide 1
a 1
tremor 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
when 1
she 1
said 1
kiss 1
me 1
again 1
tomand 1
be 1
off 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
school 1
now 1
and 1
dont 1

any 1
more 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
a 1
closet 1
and 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
a 1
jacket 1
which 1
tom 1
had 1
gone 1
pirating 1
in 1
then 1
she 1
stopped 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
dare 1
poor 1
boy 1
i 1
reckon 1
hes 1
lied 1
about 1

blessed 1
blessed 1
lie 1

such 1
a 1
comfort 1

from 1
it 1
i 1
hope 1
the 1
lordi 1
_know_ 1
the 1
lord 1
will 1
forgive 1
him 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
such 1
goodheartedness 1
in 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1

out 1
its 1
a 1
lie 1
i 1
wont 1
look 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
jacket 1
away 1
and 1
stood 1
by 1
musing 1
a 1
minute 1
twice 1
she 1
put 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
garment 1
again 1
and 1
twice 1
she 1
refrained 1
once 1
more 1
she 1
ventured 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
fortified 1
herself 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
its 1
a 1
good 1
lieits 1
a 1
good 1
liei 1
wont 1
let 1

grieve 1
me 1
so 1
she 1
sought 1
the 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
she 1
was 1
reading 1
toms 1
piece 1
of 1
bark 1
through 1
flowing 1
tears 1
and 1
saying 1
i 1
could 1
forgive 1
the 1
boy 1
now 1
if 1
hed 1
committed 1
a 1
million 1
sins 1
chapter 1
xx 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
manner 1
when 1
she 1
kissed 1
tom 1
that 1
swept 1
away 1
his 1
low 1
spirits 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
lighthearted 1
and 1
happy 1
again 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
school 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
luck 1
of 1
coming 1
upon 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
meadow 1
lane 1
his 1
mood 1
always 1
determined 1
his 1
manner 1
without 1
a 1
moments 1
hesitation 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
acted 1
mighty 1
mean 1
today 1
becky 1
and 1
im 1
so 1
sorry 1
i 1
wont 1

way 1
again 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
ever 1
i 1
liveplease 1
make 1
up 1
wont 1
you 1
the 1
girl 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
him 1
scornfully 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
ill 1
thank 1
you 1
to 1
keep 1
yourself 1
_to_ 1
yourself 1
mr 1
thomas 1
sawyer 1
ill 1
never 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
she 1
tossed 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
tom 1
was 1
so 1
stunned 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
presence 1
of 1
mind 1
enough 1
to 1
say 1
who 1
cares 1
miss 1
smarty 1
until 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
fine 1
rage 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
moped 1
into 1
the 1
schoolyard 1
wishing 1
she 1
were 1
a 1
boy 1
and 1
imagining 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
trounce 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
he 1
presently 1
encountered 1
her 1
and 1
delivered 1
a 1
stinging 1
remark 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
she 1
hurled 1
one 1
in 1
return 1
and 1
the 1
angry 1
breach 1
was 1
complete 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
becky 1
in 1
her 1
hot 1
resentment 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
wait 1
for 1
school 1
to 1
take 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
impatient 1
to 1
see 1
tom 1
flogged 1
for 1
the 1
injured 1
spellingbook 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
had 1
any 1
lingering 1
notion 1
of 1
exposing 1
alfred 1
temple 1
toms 1
offensive 1
fling 1
had 1
driven 1
it 1
entirely 1
away 1
poor 1
girl 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
fast 1
she 1
was 1
nearing 1
trouble 1
herself 1
the 1
master 1
mr 1
dobbins 1
had 1
reached 1
middle 1
age 1
with 1
an 1
unsatisfied 1
ambition 1
the 1
darling 1
of 1
his 1
desires 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
doctor 1
but 1
poverty 1
had 1
decreed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
nothing 1
higher 1
than 1
a 1
village 1
schoolmaster 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
mysterious 1
book 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
absorbed 1
himself 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
times 1
when 1
no 1
classes 1
were 1
reciting 1
he 1
kept 1
that 1
book 1
under 1
lock 1
and 1
key 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
urchin 1
in 1
school 1
but 1
was 1
perishing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
chance 1
never 1
came 1
every 1
boy 1
and 1
girl 1
had 1
a 1
theory 1
about 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
that 1
book 1
but 1
no 1
two 1
theories 1
were 1
alike 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
getting 1
at 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
now 1
as 1
becky 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
desk 1
which 1
stood 1
near 1
the 1
door 1
she 1
noticed 1
that 1
the 1
key 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
precious 1
moment 1
she 1
glanced 1
around 1
found 1
herself 1
alone 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
book 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
the 1
titlepageprofessor 1
somebodys 1
_anatomy_carried 1
no 1
information 1
to 1
her 1
mind 1
so 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
leaves 1
she 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
handsomely 1
engraved 1
and 1
colored 1
frontispiecea 1
human 1
figure 1
stark 1
naked 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
shadow 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
page 1
and 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
stepped 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
becky 1
snatched 1
at 1
the 1
book 1
to 1
close 1
it 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
hard 1
luck 1
to 1
tear 1
the 1
pictured 1
page 1
half 1
down 1
the 1
middle 1
she 1
thrust 1
the 1
volume 1
into 1
the 1
desk 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
burst 1
out 1
crying 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
vexation 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
you 1
are 1
just 1
as 1
mean 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
be 1
to 1
sneak 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
person 1
and 1
look 1

her 1

it 1
out 1
tom 1
joined 1
the 1
mob 1
of 1
skylarking 1
scholars 1
outside 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
the 1
master 1
arrived 1
and 1
school 1
took 1
in 1
tom 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
a 1
strong 1
interest 1
in 1
his 1
studies 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
stole 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
girls 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
beckys 1
face 1
troubled 1
him 1
considering 1
all 1
things 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
pity 1
her 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
help 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
up 1
no 1
exultation 1
that 1
was 1
really 1
worthy 1
the 1
name 1
presently 1
the 1
spellingbook 1
discovery 1
was 1
made 1
and 1
toms 1
mind 1
was 1
entirely 1
full 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
matters 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
after 1
that 1
becky 1
roused 1
up 1
from 1
her 1
lethargy 1
of 1
distress 1
and 1
showed 1
good 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
proceedings 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
expect 1
that 1
tom 1
could 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
by 1
denying 1
that 1
he 1
spilt 1
the 1
ink 1
on 1
the 1
book 1
himself 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
right 1
the 1
denial 1
only 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
worse 1
for 1
tom 1
becky 1
supposed 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
glad 1
of 1
that 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
believe 1
she 1
was 1
glad 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
found 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
certain 1
when 1
the 1
worst 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
worst 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
impulse 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
on 1
alfred 1
temple 1
but 1
she 1
made 1
an 1
effort 1
and 1
forced 1
herself 1
to 1
keep 1
stillbecause 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
hell 1
tell 1
about 1
me 1
tearing 1
the 1
picture 1
sure 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
not 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
life 1
tom 1
took 1
his 1
whipping 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
brokenhearted 1
for 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
unknowingly 1
upset 1
the 1
ink 1
on 1
the 1
spellingbook 1
himself 1
in 1
some 1
skylarking 1
bouthe 1
had 1
denied 1
it 1
for 1
forms 1
sake 1
and 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
custom 1
and 1
had 1
stuck 1
to 1
the 1
denial 1
from 1
principle 1
a 1
whole 1
hour 1
drifted 1
by 1
the 1
master 1
sat 1
nodding 1
in 1
his 1
throne 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
drowsy 1
with 1
the 1
hum 1
of 1
study 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
mr 1
dobbins 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
yawned 1
then 1
unlocked 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
reached 1
for 1
his 1
book 1
but 1
seemed 1
undecided 1
whether 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
or 1
leave 1
it 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
pupils 1
glanced 1
up 1
languidly 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
among 1
them 1
that 1
watched 1
his 1
movements 1
with 1
intent 1
eyes 1
mr 1
dobbins 1
fingered 1
his 1
book 1
absently 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
took 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
settled 1
himself 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
to 1
read 1
tom 1
shot 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
becky 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
hunted 1
and 1
helpless 1
rabbit 1
look 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
levelled 1
at 1
its 1
head 1
instantly 1
he 1
forgot 1
his 1
quarrel 1
with 1
her 1
quicksomething 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
flash 1
too 1
but 1
the 1
very 1
imminence 1
of 1
the 1
emergency 1
paralyzed 1
his 1
invention 1
goodhe 1
had 1
an 1
inspiration 1
he 1
would 1
run 1
and 1
snatch 1
the 1
book 1
spring 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
fly 1
but 1
his 1
resolution 1
shook 1
for 1
one 1
little 1
instant 1
and 1
the 1
chance 1
was 1
lostthe 1
master 1
opened 1
the 1
volume 1
if 1
tom 1
only 1
had 1
the 1
wasted 1
opportunity 1
back 1
again 1
too 1

said 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
the 1
master 1
faced 1
the 1
school 1
every 1
eye 1
sank 1
under 1
his 1
gaze 1
there 1
was 1
that 1
in 1
it 1
which 1
smote 1
even 1
the 1
innocent 1
with 1
fear 1
there 1
was 1
silence 1
while 1
one 1
might 1
count 1

was 1
gathering 1
his 1
wrath 1
then 1
he 1
spoke 1

stood 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
gather 1
his 1
dismembered 1
faculties 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
stepped 1
forward 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
punishment 1
the 1

the 1
gratitude 1
the 1
adoration 1
that 1
shone 1
upon 1

for 1
a 1
hundred 1

by 1
the 1
splendor 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
act 1

took 1
without 1
an 1
outcry 1
the 1
most 1
merciless 1
flaying 1
that 1
even 1
mr 1
dobbins 1
had 1
ever 1
administered 1
and 1
also 1
received 1
with 1
indifference 1
the 1
added 1
cruelty 1
of 1
a 1
command 1
to 1
remain 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1

not 1

but 1
even 1
the 1
longing 1
for 1
vengeance 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
soon 1
to 1
pleasanter 1
musings 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
asleep 1
at 1

xxi 1
vacation 1
was 1
approaching 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
always 1
severe 1
grew 1
severer 1
and 1
more 1
exacting 1
than 1
ever 1
for 1
he 1
wanted 1
the 1
school 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
good 1
showing 1
on 1
examination 1
day 1
his 1
rod 1
and 1
his 1
ferule 1
were 1
seldom 1
idle 1
nowat 1
least 1
among 1
the 1
smaller 1
pupils 1
only 1
the 1
biggest 1
boys 1
and 1
young 1
ladies 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
twenty 1
escaped 1
lashing 1
mr 1
dobbins 1
lashings 1
were 1
very 1
vigorous 1
ones 1
too 1
for 1
although 1
he 1
carried 1
under 1
his 1
wig 1
a 1
perfectly 1
bald 1
and 1
shiny 1
head 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
reached 1
middle 1
age 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
feebleness 1
in 1
his 1
muscle 1
as 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
approached 1
all 1
the 1
tyranny 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
surface 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
vindictive 1
pleasure 1
in 1
punishing 1
the 1
least 1
shortcomings 1
the 1
consequence 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
smaller 1
boys 1
spent 1
their 1
days 1
in 1
terror 1
and 1
suffering 1
and 1
their 1
nights 1
in 1
plotting 1
revenge 1
they 1
threw 1
away 1
no 1
opportunity 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
master 1
a 1
mischief 1
but 1
he 1
kept 1
ahead 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
retribution 1
that 1
followed 1
every 1
vengeful 1
success 1
was 1
so 1
sweeping 1
and 1
majestic 1
that 1
the 1
boys 1
always 1
retired 1
from 1
the 1
field 1
badly 1
worsted 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
conspired 1
together 1
and 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
promised 1
a 1
dazzling 1
victory 1
they 1
swore 1
in 1
the 1
signpainters 1
boy 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
scheme 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
help 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
reasons 1
for 1
being 1
delighted 1
for 1
the 1
master 1
boarded 1
in 1
his 1
fathers 1
family 1
and 1
had 1
given 1
the 1
boy 1
ample 1
cause 1
to 1
hate 1
him 1
the 1
masters 1
wife 1
would 1
go 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
plan 1
the 1
master 1
always 1
prepared 1
himself 1
for 1
great 1
occasions 1
by 1
getting 1
pretty 1
well 1
fuddled 1
and 1
the 1
signpainters 1
boy 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
dominie 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
proper 1
condition 1
on 1
examination 1
evening 1
he 1
would 1
manage 1
the 1
thing 1
while 1
he 1
napped 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
him 1
awakened 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
to 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
fulness 1
of 1
time 1
the 1
interesting 1
occasion 1
arrived 1
at 1
eight 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
was 1
brilliantly 1
lighted 1
and 1
adorned 1
with 1
wreaths 1
and 1
festoons 1
of 1
foliage 1
and 1
flowers 1
the 1
master 1
sat 1
throned 1
in 1
his 1
great 1
chair 1
upon 1
a 1
raised 1
platform 1
with 1
his 1
blackboard 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
tolerably 1
mellow 1
three 1
rows 1
of 1
benches 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
and 1
six 1
rows 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
were 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
dignitaries 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
parents 1
of 1
the 1
pupils 1
to 1
his 1
left 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
rows 1
of 1
citizens 1
was 1
a 1
spacious 1
temporary 1
platform 1
upon 1
which 1
were 1
seated 1
the 1
scholars 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
exercises 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
rows 1
of 1
small 1
boys 1
washed 1
and 1
dressed 1
to 1
an 1
intolerable 1
state 1
of 1
discomfort 1
rows 1
of 1
gawky 1
big 1
boys 1
snowbanks 1
of 1
girls 1
and 1
young 1
ladies 1
clad 1
in 1
lawn 1
and 1
muslin 1
and 1
conspicuously 1
conscious 1
of 1
their 1
bare 1
arms 1
their 1
grandmothers 1
ancient 1
trinkets 1
their 1
bits 1
of 1
pink 1

of 1

seized 1
him 1
his 1

he 1
was 1
like 1

endure 1
an 1

of 1

quickly 1
glides 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
welcome 1
hour 1
arrives 1
for 1
her 1
entrance 1
into 1
the 1
elysian 1
world 1
of 1
which 1
she 1
has 1
had 1
such 1
bright 1
dreams 1
how 1
fairylike 1
does 1
everything 1
appear 1
to 1
her 1
enchanted 1
vision 1
each 1
new 1
scene 1
is 1
more 1
charming 1
than 1
the 1
last 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
she 1
finds 1
that 1
beneath 1
this 1
goodly 1
exterior 1
all 1
is 1
vanity 1
the 1
flattery 1
which 1
once 1
charmed 1
her 1
soul 1
now 1
grates 1
harshly 1
upon 1
her 1
ear 1
the 1
ballroom 1
has 1
lost 1
its 1
charms 1
and 1
with 1
wasted 1
health 1
and 1
imbittered 1
heart 1
she 1
turns 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
earthly 1
pleasures 1
cannot 1
satisfy 1
the 1
longings 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
buzz 1
of 1
gratification 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
during 1
the 1
reading 1
accompanied 1
by 1
whispered 1
ejaculations 1
of 1
how 1
sweet 1
how 1
eloquent 1
so 1
true 1
etc 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
afflicting 1
sermon 1
the 1
applause 1
was 1
enthusiastic 1
then 1
arose 1
a 1
slim 1
melancholy 1
girl 1
whose 1
face 1
had 1
the 1
interesting 1
paleness 1
that 1
comes 1
of 1
pills 1
and 1
indigestion 1
and 1
read 1
a 1

there 1
were 1
very 1
few 1
there 1
who 1
knew 1
what 1

but 1
the 1
poem 1
was 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
nevertheless 1
next 1
appeared 1
a 1
darkcomplexioned 1
blackeyed 1
blackhaired 1
young 1
lady 1
who 1
paused 1
an 1
impressive 1
moment 1
assumed 1
a 1
tragic 1
expression 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
a 1
measured 1
solemn 1
tone 1
a 1
vision 1
dark 1
and 1
tempestuous 1
was 1
night 1
around 1
the 1
throne 1
on 1
high 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
star 1
quivered 1
but 1
the 1
deep 1
intonations 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
thunder 1
constantly 1
vibrated 1
upon 1
the 1
ear 1
whilst 1
the 1
terrific 1
lightning 1
revelled 1
in 1
angry 1
mood 1
through 1
the 1
cloudy 1
chambers 1
of 1
heaven 1
seeming 1
to 1
scorn 1
the 1
power 1
exerted 1
over 1
its 1
terror 1
by 1
the 1
illustrious 1
franklin 1
even 1
the 1
boisterous 1
winds 1
unanimously 1
came 1
forth 1
from 1
their 1
mystic 1
homes 1
and 1
blustered 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
enhance 1
by 1
their 1
aid 1
the 1
wildness 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
so 1
dark 1
so 1
dreary 1
for 1
human 1
sympathy 1
my 1
very 1
spirit 1
sighed 1
but 1
instead 1
thereof 1
my 1
dearest 1
friend 1
my 1
counsellor 1
my 1
comforter 1
and 1
guidemy 1
joy 1
in 1
grief 1
my 1
second 1
bliss 1
in 1
joy 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
side 1
she 1
moved 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
bright 1
beings 1
pictured 1
in 1
the 1
sunny 1
walks 1
of 1
fancys 1
eden 1
by 1
the 1
romantic 1
and 1
young 1
a 1
queen 1
of 1
beauty 1
unadorned 1
save 1
by 1
her 1
own 1
transcendent 1
loveliness 1
so 1
soft 1
was 1
her 1
step 1
it 1
failed 1
to 1
make 1
even 1
a 1
sound 1
and 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
magical 1
thrill 1
imparted 1
by 1
her 1
genial 1
touch 1
as 1
other 1
unobtrusive 1
beauties 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
glided 1
away 1
unperceivedunsought 1
a 1
strange 1
sadness 1
rested 1
upon 1
her 1
features 1
like 1
icy 1
tears 1
upon 1
the 1
robe 1
of 1
december 1
as 1
she 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
contending 1
elements 1
without 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
contemplate 1
the 1
two 1
beings 1
presented 1
this 1
nightmare 1
occupied 1
some 1
ten 1
pages 1
of 1
manuscript 1
and 1
wound 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
sermon 1
so 1
destructive 1
of 1
all 1
hope 1
to 1
nonpresbyterians 1
that 1
it 1
took 1
the 1
first 1
prize 1
this 1
composition 1
was 1
considered 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
very 1
finest 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
mayor 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
in 1
delivering 1
the 1
prize 1
to 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
it 1
made 1
a 1
warm 1
speech 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
far 1
the 1
most 1
eloquent 1
thing 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
and 1
that 1
daniel 1
webster 1
himself 1
might 1
well 1
be 1
proud 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
remarked 1
in 1
passing 1
that 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
compositions 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
word 1
beauteous 1
was 1
overfondled 1
and 1
human 1
experience 1
referred 1
to 1
as 1
lifes 1
page 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
average 1
now 1
the 1
master 1
mellow 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
geniality 1
put 1
his 1
chair 1
aside 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
audience 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
draw 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
america 1
on 1
the 1
blackboard 1
to 1
exercise 1
the 1
geography 1
class 1
upon 1
but 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sad 1
business 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
unsteady 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
smothered 1
titter 1
rippled 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
right 1
it 1
he 1
sponged 1
out 1
lines 1
and 1
remade 1
them 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
distorted 1
them 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
the 1
tittering 1
was 1
more 1
pronounced 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
entire 1
attention 1
upon 1
his 1
work 1
now 1
as 1
if 1
determined 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
mirth 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
all 1
eyes 1
were 1
fastened 1
upon 1
him 1
he 1
imagined 1
he 1
was 1
succeeding 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
tittering 1
continued 1
it 1
even 1
manifestly 1
increased 1
and 1
well 1
it 1
might 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
garret 1
above 1
pierced 1
with 1
a 1
scuttle 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
down 1
through 1
this 1
scuttle 1
came 1
a 1
cat 1
suspended 1
around 1
the 1
haunches 1
by 1
a 1
string 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
rag 1
tied 1
about 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
jaws 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
from 1
mewing 1
as 1
she 1
slowly 1
descended 1
she 1
curved 1
upward 1
and 1
clawed 1
at 1
the 1
string 1
she 1
swung 1
downward 1
and 1
clawed 1
at 1
the 1
intangible 1
air 1
the 1
tittering 1
rose 1
higher 1
and 1
higherthe 1
cat 1
was 1
within 1
six 1
inches 1
of 1
the 1
absorbed 1
teachers 1

down 1
a 1
little 1
lower 1
and 1
she 1
grabbed 1
his 1
wig 1
with 1
her 1
desperate 1
claws 1
clung 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
snatched 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
garret 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
with 1
her 1
trophy 1
still 1
in 1

possession 1

xxii 1
tom 1
joined 1
the 1
new 1
order 1
of 1
cadets 1
of 1
temperance 1
being 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
showy 1
character 1
of 1
their 1
regalia 1
he 1
promised 1
to 1
abstain 1
from 1
smoking 1
chewing 1
and 1
profanity 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
remained 1
a 1
member 1
now 1
he 1
found 1
out 1
a 1
new 1
thingnamely 1
that 1
to 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
thing 1
is 1
the 1
surest 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
body 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
that 1
very 1
thing 1
tom 1
soon 1
found 1
himself 1
tormented 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
swear 1
the 1
desire 1
grew 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
intense 1
that 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
display 1
himself 1
in 1
his 1
red 1
sash 1
kept 1
him 1
from 1
withdrawing 1
from 1
the 1
order 1
fourth 1
of 1
july 1
was 1
coming 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
gave 1
that 1
upgave 1
it 1
up 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
his 1
shackles 1
over 1
fortyeight 1
hoursand 1
fixed 1
his 1
hopes 1
upon 1
old 1
judge 1
frazer 1
justice 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
who 1
was 1
apparently 1
on 1
his 1
deathbed 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
big 1
public 1
funeral 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
high 1
an 1
official 1
during 1
three 1
days 1
tom 1
was 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
about 1
the 1
judges 1
condition 1
and 1
hungry 1
for 1
news 1
of 1
it 1
sometimes 1
his 1
hopes 1
ran 1
highso 1
high 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
his 1
regalia 1
and 1
practise 1
before 1
the 1
lookingglass 1
but 1
the 1
judge 1
had 1
a 1
most 1
discouraging 1
way 1
of 1
fluctuating 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
pronounced 1
upon 1
the 1
mendand 1
then 1
convalescent 1
tom 1
was 1
disgusted 1
and 1
felt 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
injury 1
too 1
he 1
handed 1
in 1
his 1
resignation 1
at 1
onceand 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
judge 1
suffered 1
a 1
relapse 1
and 1
died 1
tom 1
resolved 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
trust 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
that 1
again 1
the 1
funeral 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
the 1
cadets 1
paraded 1
in 1
a 1
style 1
calculated 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
late 1
member 1
with 1
envy 1
tom 1
was 1
a 1
free 1
boy 1
again 1
howeverthere 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
drink 1
and 1
swear 1
nowbut 1
found 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
the 1
simple 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
took 1
the 1
desire 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
it 1
tom 1
presently 1
wondered 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
his 1
coveted 1
vacation 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
hang 1
a 1
little 1
heavily 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
attempted 1
a 1
diarybut 1
nothing 1
happened 1
during 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
abandoned 1
it 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
negro 1
minstrel 1
shows 1
came 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
sensation 1
tom 1
and 1
joe 1
harper 1
got 1
up 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
performers 1
and 1
were 1
happy 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
even 1
the 1
glorious 1
fourth 1
was 1
in 1
some 1
sense 1
a 1
failure 1
for 1
it 1
rained 1
hard 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
procession 1
in 1
consequence 1
and 1
the 1
greatest 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
tom 1
supposed 1
mr 1
benton 1
an 1
actual 1
united 1
states 1
senator 1
proved 1
an 1
overwhelming 1
disappointmentfor 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
twentyfive 1
feet 1
high 1
nor 1
even 1
anywhere 1
in 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
circus 1
came 1
the 1
boys 1
played 1
circus 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
afterward 1
in 1
tents 1
made 1
of 1
rag 1
carpetingadmission 1
three 1
pins 1
for 1
boys 1
two 1
for 1
girlsand 1
then 1
circusing 1
was 1
abandoned 1
a 1
phrenologist 1
and 1
a 1
mesmerizer 1
cameand 1
went 1
again 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
village 1
duller 1
and 1
drearier 1
than 1
ever 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
boysandgirls 1
parties 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
few 1
and 1
so 1
delightful 1
that 1
they 1
only 1
made 1
the 1
aching 1
voids 1
between 1

harder 1
becky 1

was 1
gone 1
to 1
her 1
constantinople 1
home 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
parents 1
during 1
vacationso 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
bright 1
side 1
to 1
life 1
anywhere 1
the 1
dreadful 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
a 1
chronic 1
misery 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
cancer 1
for 1
permanency 1
and 1
pain 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
measles 1
during 1
two 1
long 1
weeks 1
tom 1
lay 1
a 1
prisoner 1
dead 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
happenings 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
he 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
nothing 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
feet 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
moved 1
feebly 1
downtown 1
a 1
melancholy 1
change 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
everything 1
and 1
every 1
creature 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
revival 1
and 1
everybody 1
had 1
got 1
religion 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
adults 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
tom 1
went 1
about 1
hoping 1
against 1
hope 1
for 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
one 1
blessed 1
sinful 1
face 1
but 1
disappointment 1
crossed 1
him 1
everywhere 1
he 1
found 1
joe 1
harper 1
studying 1
a 1
testament 1
and 1
turned 1
sadly 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
depressing 1
spectacle 1
he 1
sought 1
ben 1
rogers 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
visiting 1
the 1
poor 1
with 1
a 1
basket 1
of 1
tracts 1
he 1
hunted 1
up 1
jim 1
hollis 1
who 1
called 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
precious 1
blessing 1
of 1
his 1
late 1
measles 1
as 1
a 1
warning 1
every 1
boy 1
he 1
encountered 1
added 1
another 1
ton 1
to 1
his 1
depression 1
and 1
when 1
in 1
desperation 1
he 1
flew 1
for 1
refuge 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
huckleberry 1
finn 1
and 1
was 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
scriptural 1
quotation 1
his 1
heart 1
broke 1
and 1
he 1
crept 1
home 1
and 1
to 1
bed 1
realizing 1
that 1
he 1
alone 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
town 1
was 1
lost 1
forever 1
and 1
forever 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
there 1
came 1
on 1
a 1
terrific 1
storm 1
with 1
driving 1
rain 1
awful 1
claps 1
of 1
thunder 1
and 1
blinding 1
sheets 1
of 1
lightning 1
he 1
covered 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
the 1
bedclothes 1
and 1
waited 1
in 1
a 1
horror 1
of 1
suspense 1
for 1
his 1
doom 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
hubbub 1
was 1
about 1
him 1
he 1
believed 1
he 1
had 1
taxed 1
the 1
forbearance 1
of 1
the 1
powers 1
above 1
to 1
the 1
extremity 1
of 1
endurance 1
and 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
result 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
pomp 1
and 1
ammunition 1
to 1
kill 1
a 1
bug 1
with 1
a 1
battery 1
of 1
artillery 1
but 1
there 1
seemed 1
nothing 1
incongruous 1
about 1
the 1
getting 1
up 1
such 1
an 1
expensive 1
thunderstorm 1
as 1
this 1
to 1
knock 1
the 1
turf 1
from 1
under 1
an 1
insect 1
like 1
himself 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
tempest 1
spent 1
itself 1
and 1
died 1
without 1
accomplishing 1
its 1
object 1
the 1
boys 1
first 1
impulse 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
grateful 1
and 1
reform 1
his 1
second 1
was 1
to 1
waitfor 1
there 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
any 1
more 1
storms 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
doctors 1
were 1
back 1
tom 1
had 1
relapsed 1
the 1
three 1
weeks 1
he 1
spent 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
this 1
time 1
seemed 1
an 1
entire 1
age 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
abroad 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
hardly 1
grateful 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
spared 1
remembering 1
how 1
lonely 1
was 1
his 1
estate 1
how 1
companionless 1
and 1
forlorn 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
drifted 1
listlessly 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
found 1
jim 1
hollis 1
acting 1
as 1
judge 1
in 1
a 1
juvenile 1
court 1
that 1
was 1
trying 1
a 1
cat 1
for 1
murder 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
her 1
victim 1
a 1
bird 1
he 1
found 1

at 1
last 1
the 1
sleepy 1
atmosphere 1
was 1
stirredand 1
vigorously 1
the 1
murder 1
trial 1
came 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
it 1
became 1
the 1
absorbing 1
topic 1
of 1
village 1
talk 1
immediately 1
tom 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
it 1
every 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
murder 1
sent 1
a 1
shudder 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
for 1
his 1
troubled 1
conscience 1
and 1
fears 1
almost 1
persuaded 1
him 1
that 1
these 1
remarks 1
were 1
put 1
forth 1
in 1
his 1
hearing 1
as 1
feelers 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
suspected 1
of 1
knowing 1
anything 1
about 1
the 1
murder 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
comfortable 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
gossip 1
it 1
kept 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
shiver 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
took 1
huck 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
talk 1
with 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
some 1
relief 1
to 1
unseal 1
his 1
tongue 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
to 1
divide 1
his 1
burden 1
of 1
distress 1
with 1
another 1
sufferer 1
moreover 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
assure 1
himself 1
that 1
huck 1
had 1
remained 1
discreet 1
huck 1
have 1
you 1
ever 1
told 1
anybody 1
aboutthat 1
bout 1
what 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
ohcourse 1
i 1
havent 1
never 1
a 1
word 1

a 1
solitary 1
word 1
so 1
help 1
me 1
what 1
makes 1
you 1
ask 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
afeard 1
why 1
tom 1

wouldnt 1
be 1
alive 1
two 1
days 1
if 1
that 1
got 1
found 1
out 1
_you_ 1
know 1
that 1
tom 1
felt 1
more 1
comfortable 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
huck 1
they 1
couldnt 1
anybody 1
get 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
could 1
they 1
get 1
me 1

swear 1
again 1
anyway 1

more 1
surer 1

little 1
comfort 1

twilight 1

on 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
hanging 1
about 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1

an 1
undefined 1
hope 1
that 1
something 1
would 1
happen 1
that 1
might 1
clear 1
away 1
their 1
difficulties 1

nothing 1

there 1

to 1

interested 1

this 1
luckless 1
captive 1
the 1

often 1

gave 1

some 1
tobacco 1

matches 1

was 1
on 1

there 1
were 1
no 1

always 1
smote 1
their 1
consciences 1
beforeit 1
cut 1
deeper 1
than 1
ever 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
felt 1
cowardly 1
and 1
treacherous 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
degree 1
when 1
potter 1
said 1

tom 1
went 1
home 1
miserable 1
and 1
his 1
dreams 1
that 1
night 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
horrors 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
he 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
courtroom 1
drawn 1
by 1
an 1
almost 1
irresistible 1
impulse 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
but 1
forcing 1
himself 1
to 1
stay 1
out 1
huck 1
was 1
having 1
the 1
same 1
experience 1
they 1
studiously 1
avoided 1
each 1
other 1
each 1
wandered 1
away 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
same 1
dismal 1
fascination 1
always 1
brought 1
them 1
back 1
presently 1
tom 1
kept 1
his 1
ears 1
open 1
when 1
idlers 1
sauntered 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
courtroom 1
but 1
invariably 1
heard 1
distressing 1
newsthe 1
toils 1
were 1
closing 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
relentlessly 1
around 1
poor 1
potter 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
the 1
village 1
talk 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
injun 1
joes 1
evidence 1
stood 1
firm 1
and 1
unshaken 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
question 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
jurys 1
verdict 1
would 1
be 1
tom 1
was 1
out 1
late 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
bed 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
tremendous 1
state 1
of 1
excitement 1
it 1
was 1
hours 1
before 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
sleep 1
all 1
the 1
village 1
flocked 1
to 1
the 1
courthouse 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
both 1
sexes 1
were 1
about 1
equally 1
represented 1
in 1
the 1
packed 1
audience 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
wait 1
the 1
jury 1
filed 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
places 1
shortly 1
afterward 1
potter 1
pale 1
and 1
haggard 1
timid 1
and 1
hopeless 1
was 1
brought 1
in 1
with 1
chains 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
seated 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
curious 1
eyes 1
could 1
stare 1
at 1
him 1
no 1
less 1
conspicuous 1
was 1
injun 1
joe 1
stolid 1
as 1
ever 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
pause 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
judge 1
arrived 1
and 1
the 1
sheriff 1
proclaimed 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
the 1
usual 1
whisperings 1
among 1
the 1
lawyers 1
and 1
gathering 1
together 1
of 1
papers 1
followed 1
these 1
details 1
and 1
accompanying 1
delays 1
worked 1
up 1
an 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
preparation 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
impressive 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
fascinating 1
now 1
a 1
witness 1
was 1
called 1
who 1
testified 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
muff 1
potter 1
washing 1
in 1
the 1
brook 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
that 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
discovered 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
immediately 1
sneaked 1
away 1
after 1
some 1
further 1
questioning 1
counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
said 1
take 1
the 1
witness 1
the 1
prisoner 1
raised 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
dropped 1
them 1
again 1
when 1
his 1
own 1
counsel 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
questions 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
the 1
next 1
witness 1
proved 1
the 1
finding 1
of 1
the 1
knife 1
near 1
the 1
corpse 1
counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
said 1
take 1
the 1
witness 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
questions 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
potters 1
lawyer 1
replied 1
a 1
third 1
witness 1
swore 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
seen 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
potters 1
possession 1
take 1
the 1
witness 1
counsel 1
for 1
potter 1
declined 1
to 1
question 1
him 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
the 1
audience 1
began 1
to 1
betray 1
annoyance 1
did 1
this 1
attorney 1
mean 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
his 1
clients 1
life 1
without 1
an 1
effort 1
several 1
witnesses 1
deposed 1
concerning 1
potters 1
guilty 1
behavior 1
when 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
they 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
stand 1
without 1
being 1
crossquestioned 1
every 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
damaging 1
circumstances 1
that 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
graveyard 1
upon 1
that 1
morning 1
which 1
all 1
present 1
remembered 1
so 1
well 1
was 1
brought 1
out 1
by 1
credible 1
witnesses 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
crossexamined 1
by 1
potters 1
lawyer 1
the 1
perplexity 1
and 1
dissatisfaction 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
expressed 1
itself 1
in 1
murmurs 1
and 1
provoked 1
a 1
reproof 1
from 1
the 1
bench 1
counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
now 1
said 1
by 1
the 1
oaths 1
of 1
citizens 1
whose 1
simple 1
word 1
is 1
above 1
suspicion 1
we 1
have 1
fastened 1
this 1
awful 1
crime 1
beyond 1
all 1
possibility 1
of 1
question 1
upon 1
the 1
unhappy 1
prisoner 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
we 1
rest 1
our 1
case 1
here 1
a 1
groan 1
escaped 1
from 1
poor 1
potter 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
rocked 1
his 1
body 1
softly 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
while 1
a 1
painful 1
silence 1
reigned 1
in 1
the 1
courtroom 1
many 1
men 1
were 1
moved 1
and 1
many 1
womens 1
compassion 1
testified 1
itself 1
in 1
tears 1
counsel 1
for 1
the 1
defence 1
rose 1
and 1
said 1
your 1
honor 1
in 1
our 1
remarks 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
this 1
trial 1
we 1
foreshadowed 1
our 1
purpose 1
to 1
prove 1
that 1
our 1
client 1
did 1
this 1
fearful 1
deed 1
while 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
a 1
blind 1
and 1
irresponsible 1
delirium 1
produced 1
by 1
drink 1
we 1
have 1
changed 1
our 1
mind 1
we 1
shall 1
not 1
offer 1
that 1
plea 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
clerk 1
call 1
thomas 1
sawyer 1
a 1
puzzled 1
amazement 1
awoke 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
not 1
even 1
excepting 1
potters 1
every 1
eye 1
fastened 1
itself 1
with 1
wondering 1
interest 1
upon 1
tom 1
as 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
upon 1
the 1
stand 1
the 1
boy 1
looked 1
wild 1
enough 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
badly 1
scared 1
the 1
oath 1
was 1
administered 1

the 1
seventeenth 1
of 1

about 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
midnight 1
tom 1
glanced 1
at 1
injun 1
joes 1
iron 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
tongue 1
failed 1
him 1
the 1
audience 1
listened 1
breathless 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
refused 1
to 1
come 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
however 1
the 1
boy 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
strength 1
back 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
put 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
voice 1
to 1
make 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1

in 1
the 1
graveyard 1

little 1
bit 1
louder 1

at 1
first 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
warmed 1
to 1
his 1
subject 1
his 1
words 1
flowed 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
easily 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
every 1
sound 1
ceased 1
but 1
his 1
own 1

every 1
eye 1
fixed 1
itself 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
parted 1
lips 1
and 1
bated 1
breath 1
the 1
audience 1
hung 1
upon 1
his 1
words 1
taking 1
no 1
note 1
of 1

in 1
the 1
ghastly 1
fascinations 1
of 1
the 1
tale 1
the 1
strain 1
upon 1
pent 1
emotion 1
reached 1
its 1
climax 1
when 1
the 1

quick 1
as 1

the 1

sprang 1
for 1

hanging 1
as 1

his 1
nights 1
were 1
seasons 1
of 1
horror 1

all 1
his 1
dreams 1

always 1
with 1
doom 1
in 1

to 1
the 1

the 1
night 1
before 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
of 1

leak 1
out 1

what 1
of 1
that 1
since 1
toms 1
harassed 1
conscience 1
had 1
managed 1
to 1
drive 1
him 1
to 1
the 1

house 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
wring 1
a 1
dread 1
tale 1
from 1
lips 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
sealed 1
with 1
the 1
dismalest 1
and 1
most 1
formidable 1
of 1
oaths 1

tom 1
glad 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
but 1
nightly 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
had 1
sealed 1
up 1
his 1
tongue 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
tom 1
was 1
afraid 1
injun 1

the 1

half 1
he 1

he 1
felt 1
sure 1
he 1
never 1
could 1
draw 1
a 1
safe 1
breath 1
again 1
until 1
that 1
man 1
was 1
dead 1

he 1

joe 1
was 1
found 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
omniscient 1
and 1
aweinspiring 1
marvels 1
a 1
detective 1
came 1
up 1
from 1
st 1
louis 1
moused 1
around 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
looked 1
wise 1
and 1
made 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
astounding 1
success 1
which 1
members 1
of 1
that 1
craft 1
usually 1
achieve 1
that 1

to 1

found 1
a 1

you 1
cant 1

a 1
clew 1

so 1
after 1
that 1
detective 1
had 1
got 1
through 1
and 1
gone 1
home 1
tom 1
felt 1
just 1
as 1
insecure 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
the 1
slow 1
days 1
drifted 1
on 1
and 1
each 1
left 1
behind 1
it 1
a 1
slightly 1
lightened 1
weight 1
of 1
apprehension 1

huck 1

do 1
they 1
always 1
bury 1
it 1
as 1
deep 1
as 1
this 1
sometimesnot 1
always 1
not 1
generally 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
havent 1
got 1
the 1
right 1
place 1
so 1
they 1
chose 1
a 1
new 1
spot 1
and 1
began 1
again 1
the 1
labor 1
dragged 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
still 1
they 1
made 1
progress 1
they 1
pegged 1
away 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
finally 1
huck 1
leaned 1
on 1
his 1
shovel 1
swabbed 1
the 1
beaded 1
drops 1
from 1
his 1
brow 1
with 1
his 1
sleeve 1
and 1
said 1
where 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
dig 1
next 1
after 1
we 1
get 1
this 1
one 1
i 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
well 1
tackle 1
the 1
old 1
tree 1
thats 1
over 1
yonder 1
on 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
widows 1
i 1
reckon 1
thatll 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
but 1
wont 1
the 1
widow 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
tom 1
its 1
on 1
her 1
land 1
_she_ 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
maybe 1
shed 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
once 1
whoever 1
finds 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
hid 1
treasures 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
dont 1
make 1
any 1
difference 1
whose 1
land 1
its 1
on 1
that 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
the 1
work 1
went 1
on 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
huck 1
said 1
blame 1
it 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
place 1
again 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
mighty 1
curious 1
huck 1
i 1
dont 1
understand 1
it 1
sometimes 1
witches 1
interfere 1
i 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
thats 1
whats 1
the 1
trouble 1
now 1
shucks 1
witches 1
aint 1
got 1
no 1
power 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
well 1
thats 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
oh 1
i 1

what 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
what 1
a 1
blamed 1
lot 1
of 1
fools 1
we 1
are 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
limb 1
falls 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
thats 1
where 1
you 1
dig 1
then 1
consound 1
it 1
weve 1
fooled 1
away 1
all 1
this 1
work 1
for 1
nothing 1
now 1
hang 1
it 1
all 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
its 1
an 1
awful 1
long 1
way 1
can 1
you 1
get 1
out 1
i 1
bet 1
i 1
will 1
weve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
tonight 1
too 1
because 1
if 1
somebody 1
sees 1
these 1
holes 1
theyll 1
know 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
whats 1
here 1
and 1
theyll 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
well 1
ill 1
come 1
around 1
and 1
maow 1
tonight 1
all 1
right 1
lets 1
hide 1
the 1
tools 1
in 1
the 1
bushes 1
the 1
boys 1
were 1
there 1
that 1
night 1
about 1
the 1
appointed 1
time 1
they 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
waiting 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
and 1
an 1
hour 1
made 1
solemn 1
by 1
old 1
traditions 1
spirits 1
whispered 1
in 1
the 1
rustling 1
leaves 1
ghosts 1
lurked 1
in 1
the 1
murky 1
nooks 1
the 1
deep 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
floated 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
an 1
owl 1
answered 1
with 1
his 1
sepulchral 1
note 1
the 1
boys 1
were 1
subdued 1
by 1
these 1
solemnities 1
and 1
talked 1
little 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
judged 1
that 1
twelve 1
had 1
come 1
they 1
marked 1
where 1
the 1
shadow 1
fell 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
their 1
hopes 1
commenced 1
to 1
rise 1
their 1
interest 1
grew 1
stronger 1
and 1
their 1
industry 1
kept 1
pace 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
hole 1
deepened 1
and 1
still 1
deepened 1
but 1
every 1
time 1
their 1
hearts 1
jumped 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
pick 1
strike 1
upon 1
something 1
they 1
only 1
suffered 1
a 1
new 1
disappointment 1

around 1
in 1
a 1
shroud 1
when 1
you 1
aint 1
noticing 1
and 1
peep 1
over 1
your 1
shoulder 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
grit 1
their 1
teeth 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
ghost 1
does 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stand 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1

wont 1
hender 1
us 1
from 1
digging 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
well 1
thats 1
so 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
mighty 1
well 1
people 1
dont 1
go 1
about 1
that 1
hanted 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
nor 1
the 1
night 1
well 1
thats 1
mostly 1
because 1
they 1
dont 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
where 1
a 1
mans 1
been 1
murdered 1
anywaybut 1
nothings 1
ever 1
been 1
seen 1
around 1
that 1
house 1
except 1
in 1
the 1
nightjust 1
some 1
blue 1
lights 1
slipping 1
by 1
the 1
windowsno 1
regular 1
ghosts 1
well 1
where 1

bet 1
theres 1
a 1
ghost 1
mighty 1
close 1
behind 1

reason 1
becuz 1

chances 1
they 1

started 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
moonlit 1
valley 1
below 1
them 1
stood 1
the 1
hanted 1
house 1
utterly 1
isolated 1
its 1
fences 1
gone 1
long 1
ago 1
rank 1
weeds 1
smothering 1
the 1
very 1
doorsteps 1
the 1
chimney 1
crumbled 1
to 1
ruin 1
the 1
windowsashes 1
vacant 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
caved 1
in 1
the 1
boys 1
gazed 1
awhile 1
half 1
expecting 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
blue 1
light 1
flit 1
past 1
a 1
window 1
then 1
talking 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
tone 1
as 1
befitted 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
circumstances 1
they 1
struck 1
far 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
a 1
wide 1
berth 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
way 1
homeward 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
adorned 1
the 1
rearward 1
side 1
of 1

im 1
agreed 1
so 1
they 1
played 1
robin 1
hood 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
casting 1
a 1
yearning 1
eye 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
and 1
passing 1
a 1
remark 1
about 1
the 1
morrows 1
prospects 1
and 1
possibilities 1
there 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
into 1
the 1
west 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
way 1
homeward 1
athwart 1
the 1
long 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
soon 1
were 1
buried 1
from 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
forests 1
of 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
on 1
saturday 1
shortly 1
after 1
noon 1
the 1
boys 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
tree 1
again 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
smoke 1
and 1
a 1
chat 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
and 1
then 1
dug 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
their 1
last 1
hole 1
not 1
with 1
great 1
hope 1
but 1
merely 1
because 1
tom 1
said 1
there 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
cases 1
where 1
people 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
a 1
treasure 1
after 1
getting 1
down 1
within 1
six 1
inches 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
somebody 1
else 1
had 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
thrust 1
of 1
a 1
shovel 1
the 1
thing 1
failed 1
this 1
time 1
however 1
so 1
the 1
boys 1
shouldered 1
their 1
tools 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
feeling 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
trifled 1
with 1
fortune 1
but 1
had 1
fulfilled 1
all 1
the 1
requirements 1
that 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
business 1
of 1
treasurehunting 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
weird 1
and 1
grisly 1
about 1
the 1
dead 1
silence 1
that 1
reigned 1
there 1
under 1
the 1
baking 1
sun 1
and 1
something 1
so 1
depressing 1
about 1
the 1
loneliness 1
and 1
desolation 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
venture 1
in 1
then 1
they 1
crept 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
trembling 1
peep 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
weedgrown 1
floorless 1
room 1
unplastered 1
an 1
ancient 1
fireplace 1
vacant 1
windows 1
a 1
ruinous 1
staircase 1
and 1
here 1
there 1
and 1
everywhere 1
hung 1
ragged 1
and 1
abandoned 1
cobwebs 1
they 1
presently 1
entered 1
softly 1
with 1
quickened 1
pulses 1
talking 1
in 1
whispers 1
ears 1
alert 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
and 1
muscles 1
tense 1
and 1
ready 1
for 1
instant 1
retreat 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
familiarity 1
modified 1
their 1
fears 1
and 1
they 1
gave 1
the 1
place 1
a 1
critical 1
and 1
interested 1
examination 1
rather 1
admiring 1
their 1
own 1
boldness 1
and 1
wondering 1
at 1
it 1
too 1
next 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
look 1
upstairs 1
this 1
was 1
something 1
like 1
cutting 1
off 1
retreat 1
but 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
daring 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
but 1
one 1
resultthey 1
threw 1
their 1
tools 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
ascent 1
up 1
there 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
signs 1
of 1
decay 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
closet 1
that 1
promised 1
mystery 1
but 1
the 1
promise 1
was 1
a 1
fraudthere 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
their 1
courage 1
was 1
up 1
now 1
and 1
well 1
in 1
hand 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
begin 1
work 1
when 1
sh 1
said 1
tom 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
whispered 1

blanching 1
with 1
fright 1

coming 1
right 1
toward 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
boys 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
their 1
eyes 1
to 1
knotholes 1
in 1
the 1
planking 1
and 1
lay 1
waiting 1
in 1
a 1
misery 1
of 1
fear 1
theyve 1
stopped 1
nocoming 1
here 1
they 1
are 1

whisper 1
another 1
word 1

his 1
face 1
the 1
spaniard 1

wrapped 1
in 1
a 1
serape 1

bushy 1
white 1
whiskers 1
long 1
white 1
hair 1
flowed 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
sombrero 1
and 1
he 1
wore 1
green 1
goggles 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
in 1
tother 1

talking 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
facing 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
their 1
backs 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
speaker 1
continued 1
his 1
remarks 1
his 1
manner 1
became 1
less 1
guarded 1
and 1
his 1
words 1
more 1
distinct 1
as 1
he 1
proceeded 1

those 1

quaked 1
again 1
under 1
the 1
inspiration 1
of 1
this 1
remark 1
and 1
thought 1
how 1
lucky 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
remembered 1
it 1
was 1
friday 1
and 1
concluded 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
day 1
they 1
wished 1
in 1
their 1
hearts 1
they 1
had 1
waited 1
a 1
year 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
got 1
out 1
some 1
food 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
luncheon 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
silence 1
injun 1
joe 1
said 1

together 1
this 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
both 1
men 1
presently 1
fell 1
to 1
yawning 1
and 1
injun 1
joe 1
said 1
im 1
dead 1
for 1
sleep 1
its 1
your 1
turn 1
to 1
watch 1
he 1
curled 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
weeds 1
and 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
his 1
comrade 1
stirred 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
and 1
he 1
became 1
quiet 1
presently 1
the 1
watcher 1
began 1
to 1
nod 1
his 1
head 1
drooped 1
lower 1
and 1
lower 1
both 1
men 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
now 1
the 1
boys 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
grateful 1
breath 1
tom 1
whispered 1

tom 1
rose 1
slowly 1
and 1
softly 1
and 1
started 1
alone 1
but 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
he 1
made 1
wrung 1
such 1
a 1
hideous 1
creak 1
from 1
the 1
crazy 1
floor 1
that 1
he 1
sank 1
down 1
almost 1
dead 1
with 1
fright 1
he 1
never 1
made 1
a 1
second 1
attempt 1
the 1
boys 1
lay 1
there 1
counting 1
the 1
dragging 1
moments 1
till 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
time 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
eternity 1
growing 1
gray 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
were 1
grateful 1
to 1
note 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
setting 1

the 1
comrade 1

walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
knelt 1
down 1
raised 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rearward 1
hearthstones 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
bag 1
that 1
jingled 1
pleasantly 1
he 1
subtracted 1
from 1
it 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
dollars 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
injun 1

in 1
the 1
corner 1

the 1

forgot 1
all 1
their 1
fears 1
all 1
their 1
miseries 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
with 1
gloating 1
eyes 1

watched 1
every 1
movement 1
luckthe 1
splendor 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
beyond 1
all 1

its 1
nearly 1
dark 1
enough 1
to 1
start 1
injun 1
joe 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
from 1
window 1
to 1
window 1
cautiously 1
peeping 1
out 1
presently 1
he 1
said 1
who 1
could 1
have 1
brought 1
those 1
tools 1
here 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
they 1
can 1
be 1
upstairs 1
the 1
boys 1
breath 1
forsook 1
them 1
injun 1
joe 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
knife 1
halted 1
a 1
moment 1
undecided 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
toward 1
the 1
stairway 1
the 1
boys 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
closet 1
but 1
their 1
strength 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
steps 1
came 1
creaking 1
up 1
the 1
stairsthe 1
intolerable 1
distress 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
woke 1
the 1
stricken 1
resolution 1
of 1
the 1
ladsthey 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
spring 1
for 1
the 1
closet 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crash 1
of 1
rotten 1
timbers 1
and 1
injun 1
joe 1
landed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
amid 1
the 1
debris 1
of 1
the 1
ruined 1
stairway 1
he 1
gathered 1
himself 1
up 1
cursing 1
and 1
his 1
comrade 1
said 1
now 1
whats 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
if 1
its 1
anybody 1
and 1
theyre 1
up 1
there 1
let 1
them 1
_stay_ 1
therewho 1
cares 1
if 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
jump 1
down 1
now 1
and 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
who 1
objects 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
dark 1
in 1
fifteen 1
minutesand 1
then 1
let 1
them 1
follow 1
us 1
if 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
im 1
willing 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
whoever 1
hove 1
those 1
things 1
in 1
here 1
caught 1
a 1
sight 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
took 1
us 1
for 1
ghosts 1
or 1
devils 1
or 1
something 1
ill 1
bet 1
theyre 1
running 1
yet 1
joe 1
grumbled 1
awhile 1
then 1
he 1
agreed 1
with 1
his 1
friend 1
that 1
what 1
daylight 1
was 1
left 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
economized 1
in 1
getting 1
things 1
ready 1
for 1
leaving 1
shortly 1
afterward 1
they 1
slipped 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
deepening 1
twilight 1
and 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
their 1
precious 1
box 1
tom 1
and 1
huck 1
rose 1
up 1
weak 1
but 1
vastly 1
relieved 1
and 1
stared 1
after 1
them 1
through 1
the 1
chinks 1
between 1
the 1
logs 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
follow 1
not 1
they 1
they 1
were 1
content 1
to 1
reach 1
ground 1
again 1
without 1
broken 1
necks 1
and 1
take 1
the 1
townward 1
track 1
over 1
the 1
hill 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
talk 1
much 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
much 1
absorbed 1
in 1
hating 1
themselveshating 1
the 1
ill 1
luck 1
that 1
made 1
them 1
take 1
the 1
spade 1
and 1
the 1
pick 1
there 1
but 1
for 1
that 1
injun 1
joe 1
never 1
would 1
have 1
suspected 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
hidden 1
the 1
silver 1
with 1
the 1
gold 1
to 1
wait 1
there 1
till 1
his 1
revenge 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
money 1
turn 1
up 1
missing 1
bitter 1
bitter 1
luck 1
that 1
the 1
tools 1
were 1
ever 1
brought 1
there 1
they 1
resolved 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
for 1
that 1
spaniard 1
when 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
town 1
spying 1
out 1
for 1
chances 1
to 1
do 1
his 1
revengeful 1
job 1
and 1
follow 1
him 1
to 1
number 1
two 1
wherever 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
then 1
a 1
ghastly 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
tom 1
revenge 1
what 1
if 1
he 1
means 1
_us_ 1
huck 1
oh 1
dont 1
said 1
huck 1
nearly 1
fainting 1
they 1
talked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
entered 1
town 1
they 1
agreed 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
possibly 1
mean 1
somebody 1
elseat 1
least 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
at 1
least 1
mean 1
nobody 1
but 1
tom 1
since 1
only 1
tom 1
had 1
testified 1
very 1
very 1
small 1
comfort 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
tom 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
in 1
danger 1
company 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
palpable 1
improvement 1
he 1
thought 1
chapter 1
xxvii 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
mightily 1
tormented 1
toms 1
dreams 1
that 1
night 1
four 1
times 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
that 1
rich 1
treasure 1
and 1
four 1
times 1
it 1
wasted 1
to 1
nothingness 1
in 1
his 1
fingers 1
as 1
sleep 1
forsook 1
him 1
and 1
wakefulness 1
brought 1
back 1
the 1
hard 1
reality 1
of 1
his 1
misfortune 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
morning 1
recalling 1
the 1
incidents 1
of 1
his 1
great 1
adventure 1
he 1
noticed 1
that 1
they 1
seemed 1
curiously 1
subdued 1
and 1
far 1
awaysomewhat 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
happened 1
in 1
another 1
world 1
or 1
in 1
a 1
time 1
long 1
gone 1
by 1
then 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
adventure 1
itself 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
dream 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
very 1
strong 1
argument 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
this 1
ideanamely 1
that 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
coin 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
was 1
too 1
vast 1
to 1
be 1
real 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
fifty 1
dollars 1
in 1
one 1
mass 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
all 1
boys 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
and 1
station 1
in 1
life 1
in 1
that 1
he 1
imagined 1
that 1
all 1
references 1
to 1
hundreds 1
and 1
thousands 1
were 1
mere 1
fanciful 1
forms 1
of 1
speech 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
such 1
sums 1
really 1
existed 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
never 1
had 1
supposed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
that 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
sum 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
actual 1
money 1
in 1
any 1
ones 1
possession 1
if 1
his 1
notions 1
of 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
had 1
been 1
analyzed 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
found 1
to 1
consist 1
of 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
real 1
dimes 1
and 1
a 1
bushel 1
of 1
vague 1
splendid 1
ungraspable 1
dollars 1
but 1
the 1
incidents 1
of 1
his 1
adventure 1
grew 1
sensibly 1
sharper 1
and 1
clearer 1
under 1
the 1
attrition 1
of 1
thinking 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
presently 1
found 1
himself 1
leaning 1
to 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
dream 1
after 1
all 1
this 1
uncertainty 1
must 1
be 1
swept 1
away 1
he 1
would 1
snatch 1
a 1
hurried 1
breakfast 1
and 1
go 1
and 1
find 1
huck 1
huck 1
was 1
sitting 1
on 1
the 1
gunwale 1
of 1
a 1
flatboat 1
listlessly 1
dangling 1
his 1
feet 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
melancholy 1
tom 1
concluded 1
to 1
let 1
huck 1
lead 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
subject 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
adventure 1
would 1
be 1
proved 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
hello 1
huck 1
hello 1
yourself 1
silence 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1

once 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
have 1
hucks 1
company 1
in 1
public 1
places 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
tavern 1
no 1
2 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
occupied 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
lawyer 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
so 1
occupied 1
in 1
the 1
less 1
ostentatious 1
house 1
no 1
2 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
the 1
tavernkeepers 1
young 1
son 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
kept 1
locked 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
saw 1
anybody 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
except 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
any 1
particular 1
reason 1
for 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
had 1
had 1
some 1
little 1
curiosity 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
feeble 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
mystery 1
by 1
entertaining 1
himself 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
that 1
room 1
was 1
hanted 1
had 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
there 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
thats 1
what 1
ive 1
found 1
out 1
huck 1
i 1
reckon 1
thats 1
the 1
very 1
no 1
2 1
were 1
after 1
i 1
reckon 1
it 1
is 1
tom 1
now 1
what 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
lemme 1
think 1
tom 1
thought 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
of 1
that 1
no 1
2 1
is 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
comes 1
out 1
into 1
that 1
little 1
close 1
alley 1
between 1
the 1
tavern 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
rattle 1
trap 1
of 1
a 1
brick 1
store 1
now 1
you 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
doorkeys 1
you 1
can 1
find 1
and 1
ill 1
nip 1
all 1
of 1
aunties 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
dark 1
night 1
well 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
try 1
em 1
and 1
mind 1
you 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
for 1
injun 1
joe 1
because 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drop 1
into 1
town 1
and 1
spy 1
around 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
revenge 1
if 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
you 1
just 1
follow 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
dont 1
go 1
to 1
that 1
no 1
2 1
that 1
aint 1
the 1
place 1
lordy 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
foller 1
him 1
by 1
myself 1
why 1
itll 1
be 1
night 1
sure 1
he 1
mightnt 1
ever 1
see 1
youand 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
maybe 1
hed 1
never 1
think 1
anything 1
never 1
well 1
perhaps 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
and 1
now 1
goodbye 1
dorian 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
one 1
person 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
who 1
has 1
really 1
influenced 1
my 1
art 1
whatever 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
i 1
owe 1
to 1
you 1
ah 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
said 1
dorian 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
simply 1
that 1
you 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
admired 1
me 1
too 1
much 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
compliment 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
intended 1
as 1
a 1
compliment 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
confession 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
it 1
something 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
perhaps 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
put 1
ones 1
worship 1
into 1
words 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
disappointing 1
confession 1
why 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
expect 1
dorian 1
you 1
didnt 1
see 1
anything 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
did 1
you 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
see 1
no 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
see 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
but 1
you 1
mustnt 1
talk 1
about 1
worship 1
it 1
is 1
foolish 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
friends 1
basil 1
and 1
we 1
must 1
always 1
remain 1
so 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
harry 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
sadly 1
oh 1
harry 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
with 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
laughter 1
harry 1
spends 1
his 1
days 1
in 1
saying 1
what 1
is 1
incredible 1
and 1
his 1
evenings 1
in 1
doing 1
what 1
is 1
improbable 1
just 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
lead 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
harry 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
in 1
trouble 1
i 1
would 1
sooner 1
go 1
to 1
you 1
basil 1
you 1
will 1
sit 1
to 1
me 1
again 1
impossible 1
you 1
spoil 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
an 1
artist 1
by 1
refusing 1
dorian 1
no 1
man 1
comes 1
across 1
two 1
ideal 1
things 1
few 1
come 1
across 1
one 1
i 1
cant 1
explain 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
basil 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
never 1
sit 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
fatal 1
about 1
a 1
portrait 1
it 1
has 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
have 1
tea 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
just 1
as 1
pleasant 1
pleasanter 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
murmured 1
hallward 1
regretfully 1
and 1
now 1
goodbye 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
you 1
wont 1
let 1
me 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
once 1
again 1
but 1
that 1
cant 1
be 1
helped 1
i 1
quite 1
understand 1
what 1
you 1
feel 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
dorian 1
gray 1
smiled 1
to 1
himself 1
poor 1
basil 1
how 1
little 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
reason 1
and 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
reveal 1
his 1
own 1
secret 1
he 1
had 1
succeeded 1
almost 1
by 1
chance 1
in 1
wresting 1
a 1
secret 1
from 1
his 1
friend 1
how 1
much 1
that 1
strange 1
confession 1
explained 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
painters 1
absurd 1
fits 1
of 1
jealousy 1
his 1
wild 1
devotion 1
his 1
extravagant 1
panegyrics 1
his 1
curious 1
reticenceshe 1
understood 1
them 1
all 1
now 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
sorry 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
tragic 1
in 1
a 1
friendship 1
so 1
coloured 1
by 1
romance 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
touched 1
the 1
bell 1
the 1
portrait 1
must 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
at 1
all 1
costs 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
run 1
such 1
a 1
risk 1
of 1
discovery 1
again 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
mad 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
allowed 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
remain 1
even 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
a 1
room 1
to 1
which 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
had 1
access 1
chapter 1
10 1
when 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
steadfastly 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
of 1
peering 1
behind 1
the 1
screen 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
quite 1
impassive 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
his 1
orders 1
dorian 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
glanced 1
into 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
victors 1
face 1
perfectly 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
placid 1
mask 1
of 1
servility 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
there 1
yet 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
his 1
guard 1
speaking 1
very 1
slowly 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
framemaker 1
and 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
two 1
of 1
his 1
men 1
round 1
at 1
once 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
screen 1
or 1
was 1
that 1
merely 1
his 1
own 1
fancy 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
in 1
her 1
black 1
silk 1
dress 1
with 1
oldfashioned 1
thread 1
mittens 1
on 1
her 1
wrinkled 1
hands 1
mrs 1
leaf 1
bustled 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
asked 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
schoolroom 1
the 1
old 1
schoolroom 1
mr 1
dorian 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
why 1
it 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
dust 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
it 1
arranged 1
and 1
put 1
straight 1
before 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
see 1
sir 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
indeed 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
it 1
put 1
straight 1
leaf 1
i 1
only 1
want 1
the 1
key 1
well 1
sir 1
youll 1
be 1
covered 1
with 1
cobwebs 1
if 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
why 1
it 1
hasnt 1
been 1
opened 1
for 1
nearly 1
five 1
yearsnot 1
since 1
his 1
lordship 1
died 1
he 1
winced 1
at 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
his 1
grandfather 1
he 1
had 1
hateful 1
memories 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
matter 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
simply 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
placethat 1
is 1
all 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
key 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
her 1
bunch 1
with 1
tremulously 1
uncertain 1
hands 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
key 1
ill 1
have 1
it 1
off 1
the 1
bunch 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
of 1
living 1
up 1
there 1
sir 1
and 1
you 1
so 1
comfortable 1
here 1
no 1
no 1
he 1
cried 1
petulantly 1
thank 1
you 1
leaf 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
she 1
lingered 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
and 1
was 1
garrulous 1
over 1
some 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
household 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
to 1
manage 1
things 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
best 1
she 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
wreathed 1
in 1
smiles 1
as 1
the 1
door 1
closed 1
dorian 1
put 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
purple 1
satin 1
coverlet 1
heavily 1
embroidered 1
with 1
gold 1
a 1
splendid 1
piece 1
of 1
late 1
seventeenthcentury 1
venetian 1
work 1
that 1
his 1
grandfather 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
a 1
convent 1
near 1
bologna 1
yes 1
that 1
would 1
serve 1
to 1
wrap 1
the 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
in 1
it 1
had 1
perhaps 1
served 1
often 1
as 1
a 1
pall 1
for 1
the 1
dead 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
hide 1
something 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
corruption 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
death 1
itselfsomething 1
that 1
would 1
breed 1
horrors 1
and 1
yet 1
would 1
never 1
die 1
what 1
the 1
worm 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
corpse 1
his 1
sins 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
they 1
would 1
mar 1
its 1
beauty 1
and 1
eat 1
away 1
its 1
grace 1
they 1
would 1
defile 1
it 1
and 1
make 1
it 1
shameful 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
thing 1
would 1
still 1
live 1
on 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
always 1
alive 1
he 1
shuddered 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
regretted 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
told 1
basil 1
the 1
true 1
reason 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
wished 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
picture 1
away 1
basil 1
would 1
have 1
helped 1
him 1
to 1
resist 1
lord 1
henrys 1
influence 1
and 1
the 1
still 1
more 1
poisonous 1
influences 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
temperament 1
the 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
bore 1
himfor 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
lovehad 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
noble 1
and 1
intellectual 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
mere 1
physical 1
admiration 1
of 1
beauty 1
that 1
is 1
born 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
that 1
dies 1
when 1
the 1
senses 1
tire 1
it 1
was 1
such 1
love 1
as 1
michelangelo 1
had 1
known 1
and 1
montaigne 1
and 1
winckelmann 1
and 1
shakespeare 1
himself 1
yes 1
basil 1
could 1
have 1
saved 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
now 1
the 1
past 1
could 1
always 1
be 1
annihilated 1
regret 1
denial 1
or 1
forgetfulness 1
could 1
do 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
future 1
was 1
inevitable 1
there 1
were 1
passions 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
would 1
find 1
their 1
terrible 1
outlet 1
dreams 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
their 1
evil 1
real 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
the 1
great 1
purpleandgold 1
texture 1
that 1
covered 1
it 1
and 1
holding 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
passed 1
behind 1
the 1
screen 1
was 1
the 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
viler 1
than 1
before 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
unchanged 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
loathing 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
intensified 1
gold 1
hair 1
blue 1
eyes 1
and 1
rosered 1
lipsthey 1
all 1
were 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
the 1
expression 1
that 1
had 1
altered 1
that 1
was 1
horrible 1
in 1
its 1
cruelty 1
compared 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
censure 1
or 1
rebuke 1
how 1
shallow 1
basils 1
reproaches 1
about 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
had 1
beenhow 1
shallow 1
and 1
of 1
what 1
little 1
account 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
calling 1
him 1
to 1
judgement 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
came 1
across 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
flung 1
the 1
rich 1
pall 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
passed 1
out 1
as 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
the 1
persons 1
are 1
here 1
monsieur 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
must 1
be 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
at 1
once 1
he 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
being 1
taken 1
to 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
sly 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
thoughtful 1
treacherous 1
eyes 1
sitting 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
writingtable 1
he 1
scribbled 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
lord 1
henry 1
asking 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
round 1
something 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
reminding 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
eightfifteen 1
that 1
evening 1
wait 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
he 1
said 1
handing 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
here 1
in 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
knock 1
and 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
himself 1
the 1
celebrated 1
framemaker 1
of 1
south 1
audley 1
street 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
somewhat 1
roughlooking 1
young 1
assistant 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
was 1
a 1
florid 1
redwhiskered 1
little 1
man 1
whose 1
admiration 1
for 1
art 1
was 1
considerably 1
tempered 1
by 1
the 1
inveterate 1
impecuniosity 1
of 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
artists 1
who 1
dealt 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
he 1
never 1
left 1
his 1
shop 1
he 1
waited 1
for 1
people 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
always 1
made 1
an 1
exception 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
dorian 1
that 1
charmed 1
everybody 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pleasure 1
even 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
for 1
you 1
mr 1
gray 1
he 1
said 1
rubbing 1
his 1
fat 1
freckled 1
hands 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
myself 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
coming 1
round 1
in 1
person 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
got 1
a 1
beauty 1
of 1
a 1
frame 1
sir 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
at 1
a 1
sale 1
old 1
florentine 1
came 1
from 1
fonthill 1
i 1
believe 1
admirably 1
suited 1
for 1
a 1
religious 1
subject 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
yourself 1
the 1
trouble 1
of 1
coming 1
round 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
drop 1
in 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
framethough 1
i 1
dont 1
go 1
in 1
much 1
at 1
present 1
for 1
religious 1
artbut 1
today 1
i 1
only 1
want 1
a 1
picture 1
carried 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
heavy 1
so 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
would 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
lend 1
me 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
your 1
men 1
no 1
trouble 1
at 1
all 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
service 1
to 1
you 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
sir 1
this 1
replied 1
dorian 1
moving 1
the 1
screen 1
back 1
can 1
you 1
move 1
it 1
covering 1
and 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
get 1
scratched 1
going 1
upstairs 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
difficulty 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
genial 1
framemaker 1
beginning 1
with 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
his 1
assistant 1
to 1
unhook 1
the 1
picture 1
from 1
the 1
long 1
brass 1
chains 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
suspended 1
and 1
now 1
where 1
shall 1
we 1
carry 1
it 1
to 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
way 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
follow 1
me 1
or 1
perhaps 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
front 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
right 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
front 1
staircase 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
wider 1
he 1
held 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
passed 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
began 1
the 1
ascent 1
the 1
elaborate 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
frame 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
picture 1
extremely 1
bulky 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
obsequious 1
protests 1
of 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
true 1
tradesmans 1
spirited 1
dislike 1
of 1
seeing 1
a 1
gentleman 1
doing 1
anything 1
useful 1
dorian 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
it 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
help 1
them 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
load 1
to 1
carry 1
sir 1
gasped 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
and 1
he 1
wiped 1
his 1
shiny 1
forehead 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
heavy 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
as 1
he 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
opened 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
for 1
him 1
the 1
curious 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
hide 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
men 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
entered 1
the 1
place 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
four 1
yearsnot 1
indeed 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
it 1
first 1
as 1
a 1
playroom 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
a 1
study 1
when 1
he 1
grew 1
somewhat 1
older 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
wellproportioned 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
specially 1
built 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
lord 1
kelso 1
for 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
grandson 1
whom 1
for 1
his 1
strange 1
likeness 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
also 1
for 1
other 1
reasons 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
hated 1
and 1
desired 1
to 1
keep 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
dorian 1
to 1
have 1
but 1
little 1
changed 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
huge 1
italian 1
_cassone_ 1
with 1
its 1
fantastically 1
painted 1
panels 1
and 1
its 1
tarnished 1
gilt 1
mouldings 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
hidden 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
boy 1
there 1
the 1
satinwood 1
bookcase 1
filled 1
with 1
his 1
dogeared 1
schoolbooks 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
behind 1
it 1
was 1
hanging 1
the 1
same 1
ragged 1
flemish 1
tapestry 1
where 1
a 1
faded 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
were 1
playing 1
chess 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
while 1
a 1
company 1
of 1
hawkers 1
rode 1
by 1
carrying 1
hooded 1
birds 1
on 1
their 1
gauntleted 1
wrists 1
how 1
well 1
he 1
remembered 1
it 1
all 1
every 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
lonely 1
childhood 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
he 1
recalled 1
the 1
stainless 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
boyish 1
life 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
horrible 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
the 1
fatal 1
portrait 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
how 1
little 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
in 1
those 1
dead 1
days 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
so 1
secure 1
from 1
prying 1
eyes 1
as 1
this 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
could 1
enter 1
it 1
beneath 1
its 1
purple 1
pall 1
the 1
face 1
painted 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
could 1
grow 1
bestial 1
sodden 1
and 1
unclean 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
watch 1
the 1
hideous 1
corruption 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
youththat 1
was 1
enough 1
and 1
besides 1
might 1
not 1
his 1
nature 1
grow 1
finer 1
after 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
reason 1
that 1
the 1
future 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
shame 1
some 1
love 1
might 1
come 1
across 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
purify 1
him 1
and 1
shield 1
him 1
from 1
those 1
sins 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
already 1
stirring 1
in 1
spirit 1
and 1
in 1
fleshthose 1
curious 1
unpictured 1
sins 1
whose 1
very 1
mystery 1
lent 1
them 1
their 1
subtlety 1
and 1
their 1
charm 1
perhaps 1
some 1
day 1
the 1
cruel 1
look 1
would 1
have 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
scarlet 1
sensitive 1
mouth 1
and 1
he 1
might 1
show 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
masterpiece 1
no 1
that 1
was 1
impossible 1
hour 1
by 1
hour 1
and 1
week 1
by 1
week 1
the 1
thing 1
upon 1
the 1
canvas 1
was 1
growing 1
old 1
it 1
might 1
escape 1
the 1
hideousness 1
of 1
sin 1
but 1
the 1
hideousness 1
of 1
age 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
cheeks 1
would 1
become 1
hollow 1
or 1
flaccid 1
yellow 1
crows 1
feet 1
would 1
creep 1
round 1
the 1
fading 1
eyes 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
horrible 1
the 1
hair 1
would 1
lose 1
its 1
brightness 1
the 1
mouth 1
would 1
gape 1
or 1
droop 1
would 1
be 1
foolish 1
or 1
gross 1
as 1
the 1

the 1
twisted 1

that 1
he 1

in 1
the 1

who 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
stern 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
boyhood 1

mr 1

answered 1
the 1
framemaker 1
who 1
was 1
still 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1

dorian 1

not 1

you 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
he 1
said 1
keeping 1
his 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
felt 1
ready 1
to 1
leap 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
fling 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
if 1
he 1
dared 1
to 1
lift 1
the 1
gorgeous 1
hanging 1
that 1
concealed 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
i 1

gray 1
ever 1
ready 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
for 1
you 1
sir 1
and 1
mr 1
hubbard 1
tramped 1
downstairs 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
assistant 1
who 1
glanced 1
back 1
at 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
shy 1
wonder 1
in 1
his 1
rough 1
uncomely 1
face 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
any 1
one 1
so 1
marvellous 1
when 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
their 1
footsteps 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
dorian 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
he 1
felt 1
safe 1
now 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
ever 1
look 1
upon 1
the 1
horrible 1
thing 1
no 1
eye 1
but 1
his 1
would 1
ever 1
see 1
his 1
shame 1
on 1
reaching 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
after 1
five 1
oclock 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
tea 1
had 1
been 1
already 1
brought 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
table 1
of 1
dark 1
perfumed 1
wood 1
thickly 1
incrusted 1
with 1
nacre 1
a 1
present 1
from 1

a 1
pretty 1
professional 1
invalid 1
who 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
preceding 1
winter 1
in 1
cairo 1
was 1
lying 1
a 1
note 1
from 1
lord 1
henry 1
and 1
beside 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
book 1
bound 1
in 1
yellow 1
paper 1
the 1
cover 1
slightly 1
torn 1
and 1
the 1
edges 1
soiled 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
the 1
third 1
edition 1
of 1
_the 1
st 1
jamess 1
gazette_ 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
teatray 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
victor 1
had 1
returned 1
he 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
leaving 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
had 1
wormed 1
out 1
of 1
them 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
picturehad 1
no 1
doubt 1
missed 1
it 1
already 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
laying 1
the 1
teathings 1
the 1
screen 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
set 1
back 1
and 1
a 1
blank 1
space 1
was 1
visible 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
perhaps 1
some 1
night 1
he 1
might 1
find 1
him 1
creeping 1
upstairs 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
force 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
thing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
spy 1
in 1
ones 1
house 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
rich 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
blackmailed 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
by 1
some 1
servant 1
who 1
had 1
read 1
a 1
letter 1
or 1
overheard 1
a 1
conversation 1
or 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
card 1
with 1
an 1
address 1
or 1
found 1
beneath 1
a 1
pillow 1
a 1
withered 1
flower 1
or 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
crumpled 1
lace 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
having 1
poured 1
himself 1
out 1
some 1
tea 1
opened 1
lord 1
henrys 1
note 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
sent 1
him 1
round 1
the 1
evening 1
paper 1
and 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
might 1
interest 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
at 1
eightfifteen 1
he 1
opened 1
_the 1
st 1
jamess_ 1
languidly 1
and 1
looked 1
through 1
it 1
a 1
red 1
pencilmark 1
on 1
the 1
fifth 1
page 1
caught 1
his 1
eye 1
it 1
drew 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
following 1
paragraph 1
inquest 1
on 1
an 1
actressan 1
inquest 1

held 1
this 1

by 1

sibyl 1
vane 1
a 1
young 1
actress 1
recently 1
engaged 1
at 1
the 1
royal 1
theatre 1
holborn 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
death 1
by 1
misadventure 1
was 1
returned 1
considerable 1
sympathy 1
was 1
expressed 1
for 1
the 1
mother 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
who 1
was 1
greatly 1
affected 1
during 1
the 1
giving 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
evidence 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
dr 1
birrell 1
who 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
postmortem 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
he 1
frowned 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
two 1
went 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
flung 1
the 1
pieces 1
away 1
how 1
ugly 1
it 1
all 1
was 1
and 1
how 1
horribly 1
real 1
ugliness 1
made 1
things 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
with 1
lord 1
henry 1
for 1
having 1
sent 1
him 1
the 1
report 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
stupid 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
marked 1
it 1
with 1
red 1
pencil 1
victor 1
might 1
have 1
read 1
it 1
the 1
man 1
knew 1
more 1
than 1
enough 1
english 1
for 1
that 1
perhaps 1
he 1
had 1
read 1
it 1
and 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
suspect 1
something 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
what 1
had 1
dorian 1
gray 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
sibyl 1
vanes 1
death 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
fear 1
dorian 1
gray 1
had 1
not 1
killed 1
her 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
yellow 1
book 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
sent 1
him 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
he 1
wondered 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
little 1
pearlcoloured 1
octagonal 1
stand 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
some 1
strange 1
egyptian 1
bees 1
that 1
wrought 1
in 1
silver 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
volume 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
he 1
became 1
absorbed 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
strangest 1
book 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
read 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
in 1
exquisite 1
raiment 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
delicate 1
sound 1
of 1
flutes 1
the 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
passing 1
in 1
dumb 1
show 1
before 1
him 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
dimly 1
dreamed 1
of 1
were 1
suddenly 1
made 1
real 1
to 1
him 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
dreamed 1
were 1
gradually 1
revealed 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
novel 1
without 1
a 1
plot 1
and 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
character 1
being 1
indeed 1
simply 1
a 1
psychological 1
study 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
young 1
parisian 1
who 1
spent 1
his 1
life 1
trying 1
to 1
realize 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
all 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
modes 1
of 1
thought 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
every 1
century 1
except 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
to 1
sum 1
up 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
himself 1
the 1
various 1
moods 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
worldspirit 1
had 1
ever 1
passed 1
loving 1
for 1
their 1
mere 1
artificiality 1
those 1
renunciations 1
that 1
men 1
have 1
unwisely 1
called 1
virtue 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
those 1
natural 1
rebellions 1
that 1
wise 1
men 1
still 1
call 1
sin 1
the 1
style 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
written 1
was 1
that 1
curious 1
jewelled 1
style 1
vivid 1
and 1
obscure 1
at 1
once 1
full 1
of 1
_argot_ 1
and 1
of 1
archaisms 1
of 1
technical 1
expressions 1
and 1
of 1
elaborate 1
paraphrases 1
that 1
characterizes 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
artists 1
of 1
the 1
french 1
school 1
of 1
_symbolistes_ 1
there 1
were 1
in 1
it 1
metaphors 1
as 1
monstrous 1
as 1
orchids 1
and 1
as 1
subtle 1
in 1
colour 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
was 1
described 1
in 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
mystical 1
philosophy 1
one 1
hardly 1
knew 1
at 1
times 1
whether 1
one 1
was 1
reading 1
the 1
spiritual 1
ecstasies 1
of 1
some 1
mediaeval 1
saint 1
or 1
the 1
morbid 1
confessions 1
of 1
a 1
modern 1
sinner 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
poisonous 1
book 1
the 1
heavy 1
odour 1
of 1
incense 1
seemed 1
to 1
cling 1
about 1
its 1
pages 1
and 1
to 1
trouble 1
the 1
brain 1
the 1
mere 1
cadence 1
of 1
the 1
sentences 1
the 1
subtle 1
monotony 1
of 1
their 1
music 1
so 1
full 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
complex 1
refrains 1
and 1
movements 1
elaborately 1
repeated 1
produced 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
lad 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
from 1
chapter 1
to 1
chapter 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
reverie 1
a 1
malady 1
of 1
dreaming 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
day 1
and 1
creeping 1
shadows 1
cloudless 1
and 1
pierced 1
by 1
one 1
solitary 1
star 1
a 1
coppergreen 1
sky 1
gleamed 1
through 1
the 1
windows 1
he 1
read 1
on 1
by 1
its 1
wan 1
light 1
till 1
he 1
could 1
read 1
no 1
more 1
then 1
after 1
his 1
valet 1
had 1
reminded 1
him 1
several 1
times 1
of 1
the 1
lateness 1
of 1
the 1
hour 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
placed 1
the 1
book 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
florentine 1
table 1
that 1
always 1
stood 1
at 1
his 1
bedside 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
dinner 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
nine 1
oclock 1
before 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
club 1
where 1
he 1
found 1
lord 1
henry 1
sitting 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
morningroom 1
looking 1
very 1
much 1
bored 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
harry 1
he 1
cried 1
but 1
really 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
your 1
fault 1
that 1
book 1
you 1
sent 1
me 1
so 1
fascinated 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
forgot 1
how 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
going 1
yes 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
it 1
replied 1
his 1
host 1
rising 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
i 1
didnt 1
say 1
i 1
liked 1
it 1
harry 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
fascinated 1
me 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
ah 1
you 1
have 1
discovered 1
that 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
and 1
they 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
diningroom 1
chapter 1
11 1
for 1
years 1
dorian 1
gray 1
could 1
not 1
free 1
himself 1
from 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
or 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
more 1
accurate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
sought 1
to 1
free 1
himself 1
from 1
it 1
he 1
procured 1
from 1
paris 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
nine 1
largepaper 1
copies 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
edition 1
and 1
had 1
them 1
bound 1
in 1
different 1
colours 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
suit 1
his 1
various 1
moods 1
and 1
the 1
changing 1
fancies 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
seemed 1
at 1
times 1
to 1
have 1
almost 1
entirely 1
lost 1
control 1
the 1
hero 1
the 1
wonderful 1
young 1
parisian 1
in 1
whom 1
the 1
romantic 1
and 1
the 1
scientific 1
temperaments 1
were 1
so 1
strangely 1
blended 1
became 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
prefiguring 1
type 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
indeed 1
the 1
whole 1
book 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
contain 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
written 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
it 1
in 1
one 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
the 1
novels 1
fantastic 1
hero 1
he 1
never 1
knewnever 1
indeed 1
had 1
any 1
cause 1
to 1
knowthat 1
somewhat 1
grotesque 1
dread 1
of 1
mirrors 1
and 1
polished 1
metal 1
surfaces 1
and 1
still 1
water 1
which 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
young 1
parisian 1
so 1
early 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
occasioned 1
by 1
the 1
sudden 1
decay 1
of 1
a 1
beau 1
that 1
had 1
once 1
apparently 1
been 1
so 1
remarkable 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
an 1
almost 1
cruel 1
joyand 1
perhaps 1
in 1
nearly 1
every 1
joy 1
as 1
certainly 1
in 1
every 1
pleasure 1
cruelty 1
has 1
its 1
placethat 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
latter 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
with 1
its 1
really 1
tragic 1
if 1
somewhat 1
overemphasized 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
sorrow 1
and 1
despair 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
himself 1
lost 1
what 1
in 1
others 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
had 1
most 1
dearly 1
valued 1
for 1
the 1
wonderful 1
beauty 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
fascinated 1
basil 1
hallward 1
and 1
many 1
others 1
besides 1
him 1
seemed 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
even 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
most 1
evil 1
things 1
against 1
himand 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
strange 1
rumours 1
about 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
crept 1
through 1
london 1
and 1
became 1
the 1
chatter 1
of 1
the 1
clubscould 1
not 1
believe 1
anything 1
to 1
his 1
dishonour 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
kept 1
himself 1
unspotted 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
men 1
who 1
talked 1
grossly 1
became 1
silent 1
when 1
dorian 1
gray 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
that 1
rebuked 1
them 1
his 1
mere 1
presence 1
seemed 1
to 1
recall 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
innocence 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
tarnished 1
they 1
wondered 1
how 1
one 1
so 1
charming 1
and 1
graceful 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
could 1
have 1
escaped 1
the 1
stain 1
of 1
an 1
age 1
that 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
sordid 1
and 1
sensual 1
often 1
on 1
returning 1
home 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
mysterious 1
and 1
prolonged 1
absences 1
that 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
such 1
strange 1
conjecture 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
his 1
friends 1
or 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
creep 1
upstairs 1
to 1
the 1
locked 1
room 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
key 1
that 1
never 1
left 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
stand 1
with 1
a 1
mirror 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
looking 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
evil 1
and 1
aging 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
fair 1
young 1
face 1
that 1
laughed 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
polished 1
glass 1
the 1
very 1
sharpness 1
of 1
the 1
contrast 1
used 1
to 1
quicken 1
his 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
he 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
enamoured 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
he 1
would 1
examine 1
with 1
minute 1
care 1
and 1
sometimes 1
with 1
a 1
monstrous 1
and 1
terrible 1
delight 1
the 1
hideous 1
lines 1
that 1
seared 1
the 1
wrinkling 1
forehead 1
or 1
crawled 1
around 1
the 1
heavy 1
sensual 1
mouth 1
wondering 1
sometimes 1
which 1
were 1
the 1
more 1
horrible 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
sin 1
or 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
age 1
he 1
would 1
place 1
his 1
white 1
hands 1
beside 1
the 1
coarse 1
bloated 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
smile 1
he 1
mocked 1
the 1
misshapen 1
body 1
and 1
the 1
failing 1
limbs 1
there 1
were 1
moments 1
indeed 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
lying 1
sleepless 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
delicately 1
scented 1
chamber 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
sordid 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
illfamed 1
tavern 1
near 1
the 1
docks 1
which 1
under 1
an 1
assumed 1
name 1
and 1
in 1
disguise 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
habit 1
to 1
frequent 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
ruin 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
upon 1
his 1
soul 1
with 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
poignant 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
purely 1
selfish 1
but 1
moments 1
such 1
as 1
these 1
were 1
rare 1
that 1
curiosity 1
about 1
life 1
which 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
first 1
stirred 1
in 1
him 1
as 1
they 1
sat 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
their 1
friend 1
seemed 1
to 1
increase 1
with 1
gratification 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
desired 1
to 1
know 1
he 1
had 1
mad 1
hungers 1
that 1
grew 1
more 1
ravenous 1
as 1
he 1
fed 1
them 1
yet 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
really 1
reckless 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
in 1
his 1
relations 1
to 1
society 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
every 1
month 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
wednesday 1
evening 1
while 1
the 1
season 1
lasted 1
he 1
would 1
throw 1
open 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
his 1
beautiful 1
house 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
celebrated 1
musicians 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
to 1
charm 1
his 1
guests 1
with 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
their 1
art 1
his 1
little 1
dinners 1
in 1
the 1
settling 1
of 1
which 1
lord 1
henry 1
always 1
assisted 1
him 1
were 1
noted 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
careful 1
selection 1
and 1
placing 1
of 1
those 1
invited 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
exquisite 1
taste 1
shown 1
in 1
the 1
decoration 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
its 1
subtle 1
symphonic 1
arrangements 1
of 1
exotic 1
flowers 1
and 1
embroidered 1
cloths 1
and 1
antique 1
plate 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
indeed 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
especially 1
among 1
the 1
very 1
young 1
men 1
who 1
saw 1
or 1
fancied 1
that 1
they 1
saw 1
in 1
dorian 1
gray 1
the 1
true 1
realization 1
of 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
often 1
dreamed 1
in 1
eton 1
or 1
oxford 1
days 1
a 1
type 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
combine 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
real 1
culture 1
of 1
the 1
scholar 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
grace 1
and 1
distinction 1
and 1
perfect 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
citizen 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
them 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
those 1
whom 1
dante 1
describes 1
as 1
having 1
sought 1
to 1
make 1
themselves 1
perfect 1
by 1
the 1
worship 1
of 1
beauty 1
like 1
gautier 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
for 1
whom 1
the 1
visible 1
world 1
existed 1
and 1
certainly 1
to 1
him 1
life 1
itself 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
the 1
greatest 1
of 1
the 1
arts 1
and 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
arts 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
a 1
preparation 1
fashion 1
by 1
which 1
what 1
is 1
really 1
fantastic 1
becomes 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
universal 1
and 1
dandyism 1
which 1
in 1
its 1
own 1
way 1
is 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
assert 1
the 1
absolute 1
modernity 1
of 1
beauty 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
their 1
fascination 1
for 1
him 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
dressing 1
and 1
the 1
particular 1
styles 1
that 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
he 1
affected 1
had 1
their 1
marked 1
influence 1
on 1
the 1
young 1
exquisites 1
of 1
the 1
mayfair 1
balls 1
and 1
pall 1
mall 1
club 1
windows 1
who 1
copied 1
him 1
in 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
reproduce 1
the 1
accidental 1
charm 1
of 1
his 1
graceful 1
though 1
to 1
him 1
only 1
halfserious 1
fopperies 1
for 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
too 1
ready 1
to 1
accept 1
the 1
position 1
that 1
was 1
almost 1
immediately 1
offered 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
coming 1
of 1
age 1
and 1
found 1
indeed 1
a 1
subtle 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
really 1
become 1
to 1
the 1
london 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
day 1
what 1
to 1
imperial 1
neronian 1
rome 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
satyricon 1
once 1
had 1
been 1
yet 1
in 1
his 1
inmost 1
heart 1
he 1
desired 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mere 1
_arbiter 1
elegantiarum_ 1
to 1
be 1
consulted 1
on 1
the 1
wearing 1
of 1
a 1
jewel 1
or 1
the 1
knotting 1
of 1
a 1
necktie 1
or 1
the 1
conduct 1
of 1
a 1
cane 1
he 1
sought 1
to 1
elaborate 1
some 1
new 1
scheme 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
its 1
reasoned 1
philosophy 1
and 1
its 1
ordered 1
principles 1
and 1
find 1
in 1
the 1
spiritualizing 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
its 1
highest 1
realization 1
the 1
worship 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
has 1
often 1
and 1
with 1
much 1
justice 1
been 1
decried 1
men 1
feeling 1
a 1
natural 1
instinct 1
of 1
terror 1
about 1
passions 1
and 1
sensations 1
that 1
seem 1
stronger 1
than 1
themselves 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
conscious 1
of 1
sharing 1
with 1
the 1
less 1
highly 1
organized 1
forms 1
of 1
existence 1
but 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
dorian 1
gray 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
understood 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
remained 1
savage 1
and 1
animal 1
merely 1
because 1
the 1
world 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
starve 1
them 1
into 1
submission 1
or 1
to 1
kill 1
them 1
by 1
pain 1
instead 1
of 1
aiming 1
at 1
making 1
them 1
elements 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
spirituality 1
of 1
which 1
a 1
fine 1
instinct 1
for 1
beauty 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
dominant 1
characteristic 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
upon 1
man 1
moving 1
through 1
history 1
he 1
was 1
haunted 1
by 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
loss 1
so 1
much 1
had 1
been 1
surrendered 1
and 1
to 1
such 1
little 1
purpose 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
mad 1
wilful 1
rejections 1
monstrous 1
forms 1
of 1
selftorture 1
and 1
selfdenial 1
whose 1
origin 1
was 1
fear 1
and 1
whose 1
result 1
was 1
a 1
degradation 1
infinitely 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
that 1
fancied 1
degradation 1
from 1
which 1
in 1
their 1
ignorance 1
they 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
escape 1
nature 1
in 1
her 1
wonderful 1
irony 1
driving 1
out 1
the 1
anchorite 1
to 1
feed 1
with 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
of 1
the 1
desert 1
and 1
giving 1
to 1
the 1
hermit 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
as 1
his 1
companions 1
yes 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
prophesied 1
a 1
new 1
hedonism 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
recreate 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
save 1
it 1
from 1
that 1
harsh 1
uncomely 1
puritanism 1
that 1
is 1
having 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
day 1
its 1
curious 1
revival 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
its 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
intellect 1
certainly 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
accept 1
any 1
theory 1
or 1
system 1
that 1
would 1
involve 1
the 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
any 1
mode 1
of 1
passionate 1
experience 1
its 1
aim 1
indeed 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
experience 1
itself 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
experience 1
sweet 1
or 1
bitter 1
as 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
asceticism 1
that 1
deadens 1
the 1
senses 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
vulgar 1
profligacy 1
that 1
dulls 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
know 1
nothing 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
teach 1
man 1
to 1
concentrate 1
himself 1
upon 1
the 1
moments 1
of 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
itself 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
there 1
are 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
have 1
not 1
sometimes 1
wakened 1
before 1
dawn 1
either 1
after 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
dreamless 1
nights 1
that 1
make 1
us 1
almost 1
enamoured 1
of 1
death 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
nights 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
misshapen 1
joy 1
when 1
through 1
the 1
chambers 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
sweep 1
phantoms 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
reality 1
itself 1
and 1
instinct 1
with 1
that 1
vivid 1
life 1
that 1
lurks 1
in 1
all 1
grotesques 1
and 1
that 1
lends 1
to 1
gothic 1
art 1
its 1
enduring 1
vitality 1
this 1
art 1
being 1
one 1
might 1
fancy 1
especially 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
minds 1
have 1
been 1
troubled 1
with 1
the 1
malady 1
of 1
reverie 1
gradually 1
white 1
fingers 1
creep 1
through 1
the 1
curtains 1
and 1
they 1
appear 1
to 1
tremble 1
in 1
black 1
fantastic 1
shapes 1
dumb 1
shadows 1
crawl 1
into 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
crouch 1
there 1
outside 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
stirring 1
of 1
birds 1
among 1
the 1
leaves 1
or 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
men 1
going 1
forth 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
or 1
the 1
sigh 1
and 1
sob 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
coming 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
wandering 1
round 1
the 1
silent 1
house 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
feared 1
to 1
wake 1
the 1
sleepers 1
and 1
yet 1
must 1
needs 1
call 1
forth 1
sleep 1
from 1
her 1
purple 1
cave 1
veil 1
after 1
veil 1
of 1
thin 1
dusky 1
gauze 1
is 1
lifted 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
the 1
forms 1
and 1
colours 1
of 1
things 1
are 1
restored 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
we 1
watch 1
the 1
dawn 1
remaking 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
its 1
antique 1
pattern 1
the 1
wan 1
mirrors 1
get 1
back 1
their 1
mimic 1
life 1
the 1
flameless 1
tapers 1
stand 1
where 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
them 1
and 1
beside 1
them 1
lies 1
the 1
halfcut 1
book 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
studying 1
or 1
the 1
wired 1
flower 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
worn 1
at 1
the 1
ball 1
or 1
the 1
letter 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
afraid 1
to 1
read 1
or 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
read 1
too 1
often 1
nothing 1
seems 1
to 1
us 1
changed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
unreal 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
comes 1
back 1
the 1
real 1
life 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
known 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
resume 1
it 1
where 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
off 1
and 1
there 1
steals 1
over 1
us 1
a 1
terrible 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
the 1
continuance 1
of 1
energy 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
wearisome 1
round 1
of 1
stereotyped 1
habits 1
or 1
a 1
wild 1
longing 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
our 1
eyelids 1
might 1
open 1
some 1
morning 1
upon 1
a 1
world 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
refashioned 1
anew 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
for 1
our 1
pleasure 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
things 1
would 1
have 1
fresh 1
shapes 1
and 1
colours 1
and 1
be 1
changed 1
or 1
have 1
other 1
secrets 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
past 1
would 1
have 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
place 1
or 1
survive 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
in 1
no 1
conscious 1
form 1
of 1
obligation 1
or 1
regret 1
the 1
remembrance 1
even 1
of 1
joy 1
having 1
its 1
bitterness 1
and 1
the 1
memories 1
of 1
pleasure 1
their 1
pain 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
such 1
worlds 1
as 1
these 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
dorian 1
gray 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
true 1
object 1
or 1
amongst 1
the 1
true 1
objects 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
search 1
for 1
sensations 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
once 1
new 1
and 1
delightful 1
and 1
possess 1
that 1
element 1
of 1
strangeness 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
essential 1
to 1
romance 1
he 1
would 1
often 1
adopt 1
certain 1
modes 1
of 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
to 1
be 1
really 1
alien 1
to 1
his 1
nature 1
abandon 1
himself 1
to 1
their 1
subtle 1
influences 1
and 1
then 1
having 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
caught 1
their 1
colour 1
and 1
satisfied 1
his 1
intellectual 1
curiosity 1
leave 1
them 1
with 1
that 1
curious 1
indifference 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
incompatible 1
with 1
a 1
real 1
ardour 1
of 1
temperament 1
and 1
that 1
indeed 1
according 1
to 1
certain 1
modern 1
psychologists 1
is 1
often 1
a 1
condition 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
rumoured 1
of 1
him 1
once 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
roman 1
catholic 1
communion 1
and 1
certainly 1
the 1
roman 1
ritual 1
had 1
always 1
a 1
great 1
attraction 1
for 1
him 1
the 1
daily 1
sacrifice 1
more 1
awful 1
really 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
sacrifices 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
world 1
stirred 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
by 1
its 1
superb 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
as 1
by 1
the 1
primitive 1
simplicity 1
of 1
its 1
elements 1
and 1
the 1
eternal 1
pathos 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
tragedy 1
that 1
it 1
sought 1
to 1
symbolize 1
he 1
loved 1
to 1
kneel 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
cold 1
marble 1
pavement 1
and 1
watch 1
the 1
priest 1
in 1
his 1
stiff 1
flowered 1
dalmatic 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
white 1
hands 1
moving 1
aside 1
the 1
veil 1
of 1
the 1
tabernacle 1
or 1
raising 1
aloft 1
the 1
jewelled 1
lanternshaped 1
monstrance 1
with 1
that 1
pallid 1
wafer 1
that 1
at 1
times 1
one 1
would 1
fain 1
think 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
_panis 1
caelestis_ 1
the 1
bread 1
of 1
angels 1
or 1
robed 1
in 1
the 1
garments 1
of 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
christ 1
breaking 1
the 1
host 1
into 1
the 1
chalice 1
and 1
smiting 1
his 1
breast 1
for 1
his 1
sins 1
the 1
fuming 1
censers 1
that 1
the 1
grave 1
boys 1
in 1
their 1
lace 1
and 1
scarlet 1
tossed 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
great 1
gilt 1
flowers 1
had 1
their 1
subtle 1
fascination 1
for 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
out 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
with 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
black 1
confessionals 1
and 1
long 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
shadow 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
listen 1
to 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
whispering 1
through 1
the 1
worn 1
grating 1
the 1
true 1
story 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
error 1
of 1
arresting 1
his 1
intellectual 1
development 1
by 1
any 1
formal 1
acceptance 1
of 1
creed 1
or 1
system 1
or 1
of 1
mistaking 1
for 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
live 1
an 1
inn 1
that 1
is 1
but 1
suitable 1
for 1
the 1
sojourn 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
or 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
in 1
which 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
stars 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
is 1
in 1
travail 1
mysticism 1
with 1
its 1
marvellous 1
power 1
of 1
making 1
common 1
things 1
strange 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
subtle 1
antinomianism 1
that 1
always 1
seems 1
to 1
accompany 1
it 1
moved 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
he 1
inclined 1
to 1
the 1
materialistic 1
doctrines 1
of 1
the 1
_darwinismus_ 1
movement 1
in 1
germany 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
curious 1
pleasure 1
in 1
tracing 1
the 1
thoughts 1
and 1
passions 1
of 1
men 1
to 1
some 1
pearly 1
cell 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
or 1
some 1
white 1
nerve 1
in 1
the 1
body 1
delighting 1
in 1
the 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
absolute 1
dependence 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
on 1
certain 1
physical 1
conditions 1
morbid 1
or 1
healthy 1
normal 1
or 1
diseased 1
yet 1
as 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
no 1
theory 1
of 1
life 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
compared 1
with 1
life 1
itself 1
he 1
felt 1
keenly 1
conscious 1
of 1
how 1
barren 1
all 1
intellectual 1
speculation 1
is 1
when 1
separated 1
from 1
action 1
and 1
experiment 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
senses 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
soul 1
have 1
their 1
spiritual 1
mysteries 1
to 1
reveal 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
now 1
study 1
perfumes 1
and 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
their 1
manufacture 1
distilling 1
heavily 1
scented 1
oils 1
and 1
burning 1
odorous 1
gums 1
from 1
the 1
east 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
mood 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
its 1
counterpart 1
in 1
the 1
sensuous 1
life 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
discover 1
their 1
true 1
relations 1
wondering 1
what 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
frankincense 1
that 1
made 1
one 1
mystical 1
and 1
in 1
ambergris 1
that 1
stirred 1
ones 1
passions 1
and 1
in 1
violets 1
that 1
woke 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
dead 1
romances 1
and 1
in 1
musk 1
that 1
troubled 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
in 1
champak 1
that 1
stained 1
the 1
imagination 1
and 1
seeking 1
often 1
to 1
elaborate 1
a 1
real 1
psychology 1
of 1
perfumes 1
and 1
to 1
estimate 1
the 1
several 1
influences 1
of 1
sweetsmelling 1
roots 1
and 1
scented 1
pollenladen 1
flowers 1
of 1
aromatic 1
balms 1
and 1
of 1
dark 1
and 1
fragrant 1
woods 1
of 1
spikenard 1
that 1
sickens 1
of 1
hovenia 1
that 1
makes 1
men 1
mad 1
and 1
of 1
aloes 1
that 1
are 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
expel 1
melancholy 1
from 1
the 1
soul 1
at 1
another 1
time 1
he 1
devoted 1
himself 1
entirely 1
to 1
music 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
latticed 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
vermilionandgold 1
ceiling 1
and 1
walls 1
of 1
olivegreen 1
lacquer 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
give 1
curious 1
concerts 1
in 1
which 1
mad 1
gipsies 1
tore 1
wild 1
music 1
from 1
little 1
zithers 1
or 1
grave 1
yellowshawled 1
tunisians 1
plucked 1
at 1
the 1
strained 1
strings 1
of 1
monstrous 1
lutes 1
while 1
grinning 1

beat 1
monotonously 1
upon 1
copper 1

and 1
crouching 1
upon 1
scarlet 1

horrible 1
horned 1
adders 1
the 1
harsh 1
intervals 1
and 1
shrill 1
discords 1
of 1
barbaric 1
music 1
stirred 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
when 1
schuberts 1
grace 1
and 1
chopins 1
beautiful 1
sorrows 1
and 1
the 1
mighty 1
harmonies 1
of 1
beethoven 1
himself 1
fell 1
unheeded 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
he 1
collected 1
together 1
from 1
all 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
strangest 1
instruments 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
either 1
in 1
the 1
tombs 1
of 1
dead 1
nations 1
or 1
among 1
the 1
few 1
savage 1
tribes 1
that 1
have 1
survived 1
contact 1
with 1
western 1
civilizations 1
and 1
loved 1
to 1
touch 1
and 1
try 1
them 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
mysterious 1
_juruparis_ 1
of 1
the 1
rio 1
negro 1
indians 1
that 1
women 1
are 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
that 1
even 1
youths 1
may 1
not 1
see 1
till 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
subjected 1
to 1
fasting 1
and 1
scourging 1
and 1
the 1
earthen 1
jars 1
of 1
the 1
peruvians 1
that 1
have 1
the 1
shrill 1
cries 1
of 1
birds 1
and 1
flutes 1
of 1
human 1
bones 1
such 1
as 1
alfonso 1
de 1
ovalle 1
heard 1
in 1
chile 1
and 1
the 1
sonorous 1
green 1
jaspers 1
that 1
are 1
found 1
near 1
cuzco 1
and 1
give 1
forth 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
singular 1
sweetness 1
he 1
had 1
painted 1
gourds 1
filled 1
with 1
pebbles 1
that 1
rattled 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
shaken 1
the 1
long 1
_clarin_ 1
of 1
the 1
mexicans 1
into 1
which 1
the 1
performer 1
does 1
not 1
blow 1
but 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
inhales 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
harsh 1
_ture_ 1
of 1
the 1
amazon 1
tribes 1
that 1
is 1
sounded 1
by 1
the 1
sentinels 1
who 1
sit 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
in 1
high 1
trees 1
and 1
can 1
be 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
of 1
three 1
leagues 1
the 1
_teponaztli_ 1
that 1
has 1
two 1
vibrating 1
tongues 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
is 1
beaten 1
with 1
sticks 1
that 1
are 1
smeared 1
with 1
an 1
elastic 1
gum 1
obtained 1
from 1
the 1
milky 1
juice 1
of 1
plants 1
the 1
_yotl_bells 1
of 1
the 1
aztecs 1
that 1
are 1
hung 1
in 1
clusters 1
like 1
grapes 1
and 1
a 1
huge 1
cylindrical 1
drum 1
covered 1
with 1
the 1
skins 1
of 1
great 1
serpents 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
bernal 1
diaz 1
saw 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
cortes 1
into 1
the 1
mexican 1
temple 1
and 1
of 1
whose 1
doleful 1
sound 1
he 1
has 1
left 1
us 1
so 1
vivid 1
a 1
description 1
the 1
fantastic 1
character 1
of 1
these 1
instruments 1
fascinated 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
curious 1
delight 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
art 1
like 1
nature 1
has 1
her 1
monsters 1
things 1
of 1
bestial 1
shape 1
and 1
with 1
hideous 1
voices 1
yet 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
wearied 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
his 1
box 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
either 1
alone 1
or 1
with 1
lord 1
henry 1
listening 1
in 1
rapt 1
pleasure 1
to 1
tannhauser 1
and 1
seeing 1
in 1
the 1
prelude 1
to 1
that 1
great 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
a 1
presentation 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
jewels 1
and 1
appeared 1
at 1
a 1
costume 1
ball 1
as 1
anne 1
de 1
joyeuse 1
admiral 1
of 1
france 1
in 1
a 1
dress 1
covered 1
with 1
five 1
hundred 1
and 1
sixty 1
pearls 1
this 1
taste 1
enthralled 1
him 1
for 1
years 1
and 1
indeed 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
left 1
him 1
he 1
would 1
often 1
spend 1
a 1
whole 1
day 1
settling 1
and 1
resettling 1
in 1
their 1
cases 1
the 1
various 1
stones 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
collected 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
olivegreen 1
chrysoberyl 1
that 1
turns 1
red 1
by 1
lamplight 1

cymophane 1
with 1
its 1

spinels 1
and 1
amethysts 1
with 1
their 1
alternate 1
layers 1
of 1
ruby 1

he 1
loved 1
the 1
red 1
gold 1
of 1
the 1
sunstone 1

the 1
moonstones 1
pearly 1
whiteness 1
and 1
the 1
broken 1

of 1
the 1

procured 1
from 1
amsterdam 1
three 1
emeralds 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
size 1
and 1
richness 1
of 1
colour 1

had 1
a 1

was 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
all 1

about 1

everything 1
that 1

him 1
means 1
of 1
forgetfulness 1
modes 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
escape 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
from 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
to 1
be 1
almost 1
too 1
great 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
upon 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
the 1
lonely 1
locked 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
boyhood 1
he 1
had 1
hung 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
the 1
terrible 1
portrait 1
whose 1
changing 1
features 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
real 1
degradation 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
draped 1
the 1
purpleandgold 1
pall 1
as 1
a 1
curtain 1
for 1
weeks 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
would 1
forget 1
the 1
hideous 1
painted 1
thing 1
and 1
get 1
back 1
his 1
light 1
heart 1
his 1
wonderful 1
joyousness 1
his 1
passionate 1
absorption 1
in 1
mere 1
existence 1
then 1
suddenly 1
some 1
night 1
he 1
would 1
creep 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
dreadful 1
places 1
near 1
blue 1
gate 1
fields 1
and 1
stay 1
there 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
driven 1
away 1
on 1
his 1
return 1
he 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
sometimes 1
loathing 1
it 1
and 1
himself 1
but 1
filled 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
with 1
that 1
pride 1
of 1
individualism 1
that 1
is 1
half 1
the 1
fascination 1
of 1
sin 1
and 1
smiling 1
with 1
secret 1
pleasure 1
at 1
the 1
misshapen 1
shadow 1
that 1
had 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
that 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
to 1
be 1
long 1
out 1
of 1
england 1
and 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
villa 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shared 1
at 1
trouville 1
with 1
lord 1
henry 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
little 1
white 1
walledin 1
house 1
at 1
algiers 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
spent 1
the 1
winter 1
he 1
hated 1
to 1
be 1
separated 1
from 1
the 1
picture 1
that 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
also 1
afraid 1
that 1
during 1
his 1
absence 1
some 1
one 1
might 1
gain 1
access 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
elaborate 1
bars 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
caused 1
to 1
be 1
placed 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
conscious 1
that 1
this 1
would 1
tell 1
them 1
nothing 1
it 1
was 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
portrait 1
still 1
preserved 1
under 1
all 1
the 1
foulness 1
and 1
ugliness 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
its 1
marked 1
likeness 1
to 1
himself 1
but 1
what 1
could 1
they 1
learn 1
from 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
laugh 1
at 1
any 1
one 1
who 1
tried 1
to 1
taunt 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
painted 1
it 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
vile 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
shame 1
it 1
looked 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
would 1
they 1
believe 1
it 1
yet 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
sometimes 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
great 1
house 1
in 1
nottinghamshire 1
entertaining 1
the 1
fashionable 1
young 1
men 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
rank 1
who 1
were 1
his 1
chief 1
companions 1
and 1
astounding 1
the 1
county 1
by 1
the 1
wanton 1
luxury 1
and 1
gorgeous 1
splendour 1
of 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
would 1
suddenly 1
leave 1
his 1
guests 1
and 1
rush 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
tampered 1
with 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
what 1
if 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
stolen 1
the 1
mere 1
thought 1
made 1
him 1
cold 1
with 1
horror 1
surely 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
know 1
his 1
secret 1
then 1
perhaps 1
the 1
world 1
already 1
suspected 1
it 1
for 1
while 1
he 1
fascinated 1
many 1
there 1
were 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
who 1
distrusted 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
blackballed 1
at 1
a 1
west 1
end 1
club 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
birth 1
and 1
social 1
position 1
fully 1
entitled 1
him 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
member 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
brought 1
by 1
a 1
friend 1
into 1
the 1
smokingroom 1
of 1
the 1
churchill 1
the 1
duke 1
of 1
berwick 1
and 1
another 1
gentleman 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
marked 1
manner 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
curious 1
stories 1
became 1
current 1
about 1
him 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
his 1
twentyfifth 1
year 1
it 1
was 1
rumoured 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
brawling 1
with 1
foreign 1
sailors 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
den 1
in 1
the 1
distant 1
parts 1
of 1
whitechapel 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
consorted 1
with 1
thieves 1
and 1
coiners 1
and 1
knew 1
the 1
mysteries 1
of 1
their 1
trade 1
his 1
extraordinary 1
absences 1
became 1
notorious 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
reappear 1
again 1
in 1
society 1
men 1
would 1
whisper 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
corners 1
or 1
pass 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
sneer 1
or 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
cold 1
searching 1
eyes 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
determined 1
to 1
discover 1
his 1
secret 1
of 1
such 1
insolences 1
and 1
attempted 1
slights 1
he 1
of 1
course 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
opinion 1
of 1
most 1
people 1
his 1
frank 1
debonair 1
manner 1
his 1
charming 1
boyish 1
smile 1
and 1
the 1
infinite 1
grace 1
of 1
that 1
wonderful 1
youth 1
that 1
seemed 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
were 1
in 1
themselves 1
a 1
sufficient 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
calumnies 1
for 1
so 1
they 1
termed 1
them 1
that 1
were 1
circulated 1
about 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
remarked 1
however 1
that 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
most 1
intimate 1
with 1
him 1
appeared 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
to 1
shun 1
him 1
women 1
who 1
had 1
wildly 1
adored 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
his 1
sake 1
had 1
braved 1
all 1
social 1
censure 1
and 1
set 1
convention 1
at 1
defiance 1
were 1
seen 1
to 1
grow 1
pallid 1
with 1
shame 1
or 1
horror 1
if 1
dorian 1
gray 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
yet 1
these 1
whispered 1
scandals 1
only 1
increased 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
many 1
his 1
strange 1
and 1
dangerous 1
charm 1
his 1
great 1
wealth 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
element 1
of 1
security 1
societycivilized 1
society 1
at 1
leastis 1
never 1
very 1
ready 1
to 1

anything 1
to 1
the 1
detriment 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
both 1
rich 1
and 1
fascinating 1
it 1
feels 1
instinctively 1
that 1
manners 1
are 1
of 1
more 1
importance 1
than 1
morals 1
and 1
in 1
its 1
opinion 1
the 1
highest 1
respectability 1
is 1
of 1
much 1
less 1
value 1
than 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
a 1
good 1
_chef_ 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
poor 1
consolation 1
to 1
be 1
told 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
given 1
one 1
a 1
bad 1
dinner 1
or 1
poor 1
wine 1
is 1
irreproachable 1

lord 1
henry 1
remarked 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
discussion 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
possibly 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
his 1
view 1
for 1
the 1
canons 1
of 1
good 1
society 1
are 1
or 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
the 1
canons 1

absolutely 1
essential 1

should 1
have 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
a 1
ceremony 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
its 1
unreality 1
and 1
should 1
combine 1
the 1
insincere 1
character 1
of 1
a 1
romantic 1
play 1
with 1
the 1
wit 1
and 1
beauty 1
that 1
make 1

insincerity 1

a 1
terrible 1
thing 1
i 1
think 1
not 1
it 1

merely 1
a 1
method 1
by 1
which 1
we 1
can 1

psychology 1

that 1
bore 1
within 1
itself 1
strange 1
legacies 1
of 1
thought 1

passion 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
flesh 1
was 1
tainted 1
with 1
the 1
monstrous 1

wonderful 1
in 1

depth 1

brilliancy 1
of 1
colour 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
follow 1
him 1
wherever 1
he 1
went 1
yet 1
one 1
had 1
ancestors 1
in 1
literature 1
as 1
well 1
as 1

nearer 1
perhaps 1
in 1
type 1

certainly 1
with 1
an 1
influence 1
of 1
which 1
one 1
was 1
more 1
absolutely 1
conscious 1
there 1
were 1
times 1
when 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
dorian 1
gray 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
history 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
record 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
not 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
it 1
in 1
act 1
and 1
circumstance 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
imagination 1
had 1
created 1
it 1
for 1
him 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
brain 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
passions 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
them 1
all 1
those 1
strange 1
terrible 1
figures 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
across 1
the 1
stage 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
made 1
sin 1
so 1
marvellous 1
and 1
evil 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
subtlety 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
in 1
some 1
mysterious 1
way 1
their 1
lives 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
the 1
hero 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
novel 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
influenced 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
himself 1
known 1
this 1
curious 1
fancy 1
in 1
the 1
seventh 1
chapter 1
he 1
tells 1
how 1
crowned 1
with 1
laurel 1
lest 1
lightning 1
might 1
strike 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
as 1
tiberius 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
at 1
capri 1
reading 1
the 1
shameful 1
books 1
of 1
elephantis 1
while 1
dwarfs 1
and 1
peacocks 1
strutted 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
fluteplayer 1
mocked 1
the 1
swinger 1
of 1
the 1
censer 1
and 1
as 1
caligula 1
had 1
caroused 1
with 1
the 1
greenshirted 1
jockeys 1
in 1
their 1
stables 1
and 1
supped 1
in 1
an 1
ivory 1
manger 1
with 1
a 1
jewelfrontleted 1
horse 1
and 1
as 1
domitian 1
had 1
wandered 1
through 1
a 1
corridor 1
lined 1

on 1
the 1
ninth 1
of 1
november 1
the 1
eve 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
thirtyeighth 1
birthday 1
as 1
he 1
often 1
remembered 1
afterwards 1
he 1
was 1
walking 1
home 1
about 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
from 1
lord 1
henrys 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
dining 1
and 1
was 1
wrapped 1
in 1
heavy 1
furs 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
foggy 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
grosvenor 1
square 1
and 1
south 1
audley 1
street 1
a 1
man 1
passed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
mist 1
walking 1
very 1
fast 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
collar 1
of 1
his 1
grey 1
ulster 1
turned 1
up 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
bag 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
dorian 1
recognized 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
basil 1
hallward 1
a 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
fear 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
recognition 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
quickly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
but 1
hallward 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
dorian 1
heard 1
him 1
first 1
stopping 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
and 1
then 1
hurrying 1
after 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
dorian 1
what 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
piece 1
of 1
luck 1

oclock 1

said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
languidly 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
his 1
latchkey 1
the 1
lamplight 1
struggled 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
hallward 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
watch 1

have 1
heaps 1
of 1
time 1
he 1
answered 1

and 1
i 1
can 1
easily 1
get 1
to 1
victoria 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
smiled 1
what 1
a 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
fashionable 1
painter 1
to 1
travel 1
a 1
gladstone 1
bag 1
and 1
an 1
ulster 1
come 1
in 1
or 1
the 1
fog 1

get 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
mind 1
you 1
dont 1
talk 1
about 1
anything 1
serious 1
nothing 1
is 1
serious 1
nowadays 1
at 1
least 1
nothing 1
should 1
be 1
hallward 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
and 1
followed 1
dorian 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bright 1
wood 1
fire 1
blazing 1
in 1
the 1
large 1
open 1
hearth 1
the 1
lamps 1
were 1
lit 1
and 1
an 1
open 1
dutch 1
silver 1
spiritcase 1
stood 1
with 1
some 1
siphons 1
of 1
sodawater 1
and 1
large 1
cutglass 1
tumblers 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
marqueterie 1
table 1
you 1

your 1
servant 1

me 1
quite 1
at 1
home 1

gave 1
me 1
everything 1
i 1
wanted 1
including 1
your 1
best 1
goldtipped 1
cigarettes 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
hospitable 1
creature 1
i 1
like 1
him 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
frenchman 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
have 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
frenchman 1
by 1
the 1
bye 1
dorian 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
married 1
lady 1
radleys 1
maid 1
and 1
has 1
established 1
her 1
in 1
paris 1
as 1
an 1
english 1
dressmaker 1
anglomania 1
is 1
very 1
fashionable 1
over 1
there 1
now 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
seems 1
silly 1
of 1
the 1
french 1
doesnt 1
it 1
butdo 1
you 1
knowhe 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
servant 1
i 1
never 1
liked 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
about 1
one 1
often 1
imagines 1
things 1
that 1
are 1
quite 1
absurd 1
he 1
was 1
really 1
very 1
devoted 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
seemed 1
quite 1
sorry 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
have 1
another 1
brandyandsoda 1
or 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
hockandseltzer 1
i 1
always 1
take 1
hockandseltzer 1
myself 1
there 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
some 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
thanks 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
anything 1
more 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
taking 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
coat 1
off 1
and 1
throwing 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
bag 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
now 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
seriously 1
dont 1
frown 1
like 1
that 1
you 1
make 1
it 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
difficult 1
for 1
me 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
all 1
about 1
cried 1
dorian 1
in 1
his 1
petulant 1
way 1
flinging 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
about 1
myself 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
myself 1
tonight 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
somebody 1
else 1
it 1
is 1
about 1
yourself 1
answered 1
hallward 1
in 1
his 1
grave 1
deep 1
voice 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
shall 1
only 1
keep 1
you 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
dorian 1
sighed 1
and 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
murmured 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
dorian 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
sake 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
speaking 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
most 1
dreadful 1
things 1
are 1
being 1
said 1
against 1
you 1
in 1
london 1
i 1
dont 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
them 1
i 1
love 1
scandals 1
about 1
other 1
people 1
but 1
scandals 1
about 1
myself 1
dont 1
interest 1
me 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
novelty 1
they 1
must 1
interest 1
you 1
dorian 1
every 1
gentleman 1
is 1
interested 1
in 1
his 1
good 1
name 1
you 1
dont 1
want 1
people 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
something 1
vile 1
and 1
degraded 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
have 1
your 1
position 1
and 1
your 1
wealth 1
and 1

a 1
thing 1
that 1

itself 1
across 1

mans 1
face 1

cannot 1
be 1
concealed 1
people 1
talk 1
sometimes 1
of 1
secret 1
vices 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
such 1
things 1
if 1
a 1
wretched 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
vice 1
it 1
shows 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
the 1
droop 1
of 1
his 1
eyelids 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
even 1
somebodyi 1

year 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
portrait 1
done 1
i 1

never 1
seen 1
him 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
heard 1
anything 1
about 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
though 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
since 1
he 1
offered 1
an 1
extravagant 1
price 1
i 1
refused 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
his 1
fingers 1
that 1
i 1
hated 1
i 1
know 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
what 1
i 1
fancied 1
about 1
him 1
his 1
life 1
is 1
dreadful 1
but 1
you 1
dorian 1
with 1
your 1
pure 1
bright 1
innocent 1
face 1
and 1
your 1
marvellous 1
untroubled 1
youthi 1
cant 1
believe 1
anything 1
against 1
you 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
very 1
seldom 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
studio 1
now 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
away 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
hear 1
all 1
these 1
hideous 1
things 1
that 1
people 1
are 1
whispering 1
about 1
you 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
dorian 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
the 1
duke 1
of 1
berwick 1
leaves 1
the 1
room 1
of 1
a 1
club 1
when 1
you 1
enter 1
it 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
so 1
many 1
gentlemen 1
in 1
london 1
will 1
neither 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
house 1
or 1
invite 1
you 1
to 1
theirs 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
lord 1
staveley 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
dinner 1
last 1
week 1
your 1
name 1
happened 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
in 1
conversation 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
miniatures 1
you 1
have 1
lent 1
to 1
the 1
exhibition 1
at 1
the 1
dudley 1
staveley 1
curled 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
artistic 1
tastes 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
man 1
whom 1
no 1
pureminded 1
girl 1
should 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
and 1
whom 1
no 1
chaste 1
woman 1
should 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
with 1
i 1
reminded 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
meant 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
right 1
out 1
before 1
everybody 1
it 1
was 1
horrible 1
why 1
is 1
your 1
friendship 1
so 1
fatal 1
to 1
young 1
men 1
there 1
was 1
that 1
wretched 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
guards 1
who 1
committed 1
suicide 1
you 1
were 1
his 1
great 1
friend 1
there 1
was 1
sir 1
henry 1
ashton 1
who 1
had 1
to 1
leave 1
england 1
with 1
a 1
tarnished 1
name 1

and 1
he 1
were 1
inseparable 1

about 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
and 1
his 1
dreadful 1
end 1

career 1

met 1
his 1
father 1
yesterday 1
in 1
st 1
jamess 1

he 1
seemed 1
broken 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
sorrow 1
what 1
about 1
the 1
young 1
duke 1
of 1
perth 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1

got 1
now 1
what 1
gentleman 1

associate 1
with 1
him 1
stop 1
basil 1
you 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
know 1
nothing 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
infinite 1
contempt 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
why 1
berwick 1
leaves 1
a 1
room 1
when 1
i 1
enter 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
i 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
his 1
life 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
anything 1
about 1
mine 1
with 1
such 1
blood 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
in 1
his 1
veins 1
how 1
could 1
his 1
record 1
be 1
clean 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
about 1
henry 1
ashton 1
and 1
young 1
perth 1
did 1
i 1
teach 1
the 1
one 1
his 1
vices 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
his 1
debauchery 1
if 1
kents 1
silly 1
son 1
takes 1
his 1
wife 1
from 1
the 1
streets 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
writes 1
his 1
friends 1
name 1
across 1
a 1
bill 1
am 1
i 1
his 1
keeper 1
i 1
know 1
how 1
people 1
chatter 1
in 1
england 1
the 1
middle 1
classes 1
air 1
their 1
moral 1
prejudices 1
over 1
their 1
gross 1
dinnertables 1
and 1
whisper 1
about 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
the 1
profligacies 1
of 1
their 1
betters 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
pretend 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
smart 1
society 1
and 1
on 1
intimate 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
people 1
they 1
slander 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
have 1
distinction 1
and 1
brains 1
for 1
every 1
common 1
tongue 1
to 1
wag 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
lives 1
do 1
these 1
people 1
who 1
pose 1
as 1
being 1
moral 1
lead 1
themselves 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
you 1
forget 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
native 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
hypocrite 1
dorian 1
cried 1
hallward 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
question 1
england 1
is 1
bad 1
enough 1
i 1
know 1
and 1
english 1
society 1
is 1
all 1
wrong 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
fine 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
fine 1
one 1

a 1
right 1
to 1
judge 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
by 1
the 1
effect 1
he 1
has 1
over 1
his 1
friends 1
yours 1
seem 1
to 1
lose 1
all 1
sense 1
of 1
honour 1
of 1
goodness 1
of 1
purity 1
you 1
have 1
filled 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
madness 1
for 1
pleasure 1
they 1
have 1
gone 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
you 1
led 1
them 1
there 1
yes 1
you 1
led 1
them 1
there 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
can 1
smile 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
smiling 1
now 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
worse 1
behind 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
and 1
harry 1
are 1
inseparable 1
surely 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
if 1
for 1
none 1
other 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
made 1
his 1

basil 1
you 1
go 1
too 1
far 1
i 1
must 1
speak 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
listen 1
you 1
shall 1
listen 1
when 1
you 1
met 1
lady 1
gwendolen 1
not 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
scandal 1
had 1
ever 1
touched 1
her 1
is 1
there 1
a 1
single 1
decent 1
woman 1
in 1
london 1
now 1
who 1
would 1
drive 1
with 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
why 1
even 1
her 1
children 1
are 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
her 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
storiesstories 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
seen 1
creeping 1
at 1
dawn 1
out 1
of 1
dreadful 1
houses 1
and 1
slinking 1
in 1
disguise 1
into 1
the 1
foulest 1
dens 1
in 1
london 1
are 1
they 1
true 1
can 1
they 1
be 1
true 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
heard 1
them 1
i 1
laughed 1
i 1
hear 1
them 1
now 1
and 1
they 1
make 1
me 1
shudder 1
what 1
about 1
your 1
countryhouse 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
led 1
there 1
dorian 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
said 1
about 1
you 1
i 1
wont 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
remember 1
harry 1
saying 1
once 1
that 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
turned 1
himself 1
into 1
an 1
amateur 1
curate 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
always 1
began 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
and 1
then 1
proceeded 1
to 1
break 1
his 1
word 1
i 1
do 1
want 1
to 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
lead 1
such 1
a 1
life 1
as 1
will 1
make 1
the 1
world 1
respect 1
you 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
clean 1
name 1
and 1
a 1
fair 1
record 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
people 1
you 1
associate 1
with 1
dont 1
shrug 1
your 1
shoulders 1
like 1
that 1
dont 1
be 1
so 1
indifferent 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
wonderful 1
influence 1
let 1
it 1
be 1
for 1
good 1
not 1
for 1
evil 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
corrupt 1
every 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
you 1
become 1
intimate 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
sufficient 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
enter 1
a 1
house 1
for 1
shame 1
of 1
some 1
kind 1
to 1
follow 1
after 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
or 1
not 1
how 1
should 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
things 1
that 1
it 1
seems 1
impossible 1
to 1
doubt 1
lord 1
gloucester 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
greatest 1
friends 1
at 1
oxford 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
dying 1
alone 1
in 1
her 1
villa 1
at 1
mentone 1
your 1
name 1
was 1
implicated 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
terrible 1
confession 1
i 1
ever 1
read 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
absurdthat 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
thoroughly 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
incapable 1
of 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
know 1
you 1
i 1
wonder 1
do 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
answer 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
soul 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
soul 1
muttered 1
dorian 1
gray 1
starting 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
turning 1
almost 1
white 1
from 1
fear 1
yes 1
answered 1
hallward 1
gravely 1
and 1
with 1
deeptoned 1
sorrow 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
soul 1
but 1
only 1
god 1
can 1
do 1
that 1
a 1
bitter 1
laugh 1
of 1
mockery 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
it 1
yourself 1
tonight 1
he 1
cried 1
seizing 1
a 1
lamp 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
come 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
handiwork 1
why 1
shouldnt 1
you 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
world 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
afterwards 1
if 1
you 1
choose 1
nobody 1
would 1
believe 1
you 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
believe 1
you 1
they 1
would 1
like 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
age 1
better 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
though 1
you 1
will 1
prate 1
about 1
it 1
so 1
tediously 1
come 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
chattered 1
enough 1
about 1
corruption 1
now 1
you 1
shall 1
look 1
on 1
it 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
pride 1
in 1
every 1
word 1
he 1
uttered 1
he 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
in 1
his 1
boyish 1
insolent 1
manner 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
terrible 1
joy 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
to 1
share 1
his 1
secret 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
shame 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
burdened 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
with 1
the 1
hideous 1
memory 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
yes 1
he 1
continued 1
coming 1
closer 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
looking 1
steadfastly 1
into 1
his 1
stern 1
eyes 1
i 1
shall 1
show 1
you 1
my 1
soul 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
you 1
fancy 1
only 1
god 1
can 1
see 1
hallward 1
started 1
back 1
this 1
is 1
blasphemy 1
dorian 1
he 1
cried 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
horrible 1
and 1
they 1
dont 1
mean 1
anything 1
you 1
think 1
so 1
he 1
laughed 1
again 1
i 1
know 1
so 1
as 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
you 1
tonight 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
for 1
your 1
good 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
always 1
a 1
stanch 1
friend 1
to 1
you 1
dont 1
touch 1
me 1
finish 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
twisted 1
flash 1
of 1
pain 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
painters 1
face 1
he 1
paused 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
a 1
wild 1
feeling 1
of 1
pity 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
after 1
all 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
he 1
to 1
pry 1
into 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
a 1
tithe 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
rumoured 1
about 1
him 1
how 1
much 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
then 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
fireplace 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
burning 1
logs 1
with 1
their 1
frostlike 1
ashes 1
and 1
their 1
throbbing 1
cores 1
of 1
flame 1
i 1
am 1
waiting 1
basil 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
hard 1
clear 1
voice 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
this 1
he 1
cried 1
you 1
must 1

me 1
some 1
answer 1
to 1
these 1
horrible 1
charges 1
that 1
are 1
made 1
against 1

are 1

bad 1
and 1
corrupt 1
and 1
shameful 1
dorian 1
gray 1
smiled 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
curl 1
of 1
contempt 1
in 1
his 1
lips 1
come 1
upstairs 1
basil 1
he 1
said 1
quietly 1
i 1

a 1
diary 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
from 1
day 1
to 1
day 1
and 1
it 1

room 1

it 1

ask 1
me 1

a 1
plain 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
question 1
that 1

he 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
the 1
ascent 1
basil 1
hallward 1
following 1
close 1
behind 1
they 1
walked 1
softly 1
as 1
men 1
do 1
instinctively 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
lamp 1
cast 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
staircase 1
a 1
rising 1
wind 1
made 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
rattle 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
dorian 1
set 1
the 1
lamp 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
taking 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
turned 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
you 1
insist 1
on 1
knowing 1
basil 1
he 1
asked 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
yes 1
i 1
am 1
delighted 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
then 1
he 1
added 1
somewhat 1
harshly 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
who 1
is 1
entitled 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
me 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
current 1
of 1
air 1
passed 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
shot 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
a 1
flame 1
of 1
murky 1
orange 1
he 1
shuddered 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
you 1
he 1
whispered 1
as 1
he 1
placed 1
the 1
lamp 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
hallward 1
glanced 1
round 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
puzzled 1
expression 1
the 1
room 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
lived 1
in 1
for 1
years 1
a 1
faded 1
flemish 1
tapestry 1
a 1
curtained 1
picture 1
an 1
old 1
italian 1
_cassone_ 1
and 1
an 1
almost 1
empty 1
bookcasethat 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
contain 1
besides 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
a 1
table 1
as 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
lighting 1
a 1
halfburned 1
candle 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
dust 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
carpet 1
was 1
in 1
holes 1
a 1
mouse 1
ran 1
scuffling 1
behind 1
the 1
wainscoting 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
damp 1
odour 1
of 1
mildew 1
so 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
god 1
who 1
sees 1
the 1
soul 1
basil 1
draw 1
that 1
curtain 1
back 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
mine 1
the 1
voice 1
that 1
spoke 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
cruel 1
you 1
are 1
mad 1
dorian 1
or 1
playing 1
a 1
part 1
muttered 1
hallward 1
frowning 1
you 1
wont 1
then 1
i 1
must 1
do 1
it 1
myself 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
tore 1
the 1
curtain 1
from 1
its 1
rod 1
and 1
flung 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
horror 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
painters 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
light 1
the 1
hideous 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
grinning 1
at 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
its 1
expression 1
that 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
disgust 1
and 1
loathing 1
good 1
heavens 1
it 1
was 1
dorian 1
grays 1
own 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
horror 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
entirely 1
spoiled 1
that 1
marvellous 1
beauty 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
some 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
thinning 1
hair 1
and 1
some 1
scarlet 1
on 1
the 1
sensual 1
mouth 1
the 1
sodden 1
eyes 1
had 1
kept 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
their 1
blue 1
the 1
noble 1
curves 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
completely 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
chiselled 1
nostrils 1
and 1
from 1
plastic 1
throat 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
dorian 1
himself 1
but 1
who 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
recognize 1
his 1
own 1
brushwork 1
and 1
the 1
frame 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
design 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
monstrous 1
yet 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
he 1
seized 1
the 1
lighted 1
candle 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
in 1
the 1
lefthand 1
corner 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
name 1
traced 1
in 1
long 1
letters 1
of 1
bright 1
vermilion 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
foul 1
parody 1
some 1
infamous 1
ignoble 1
satire 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
done 1
that 1
still 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
picture 1
he 1
knew 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
blood 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
fire 1
to 1
sluggish 1
ice 1
his 1
own 1
picture 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
mean 1
why 1
had 1
it 1
altered 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
a 1
sick 1
man 1
his 1
mouth 1
twitched 1
and 1
his 1
parched 1
tongue 1
seemed 1
unable 1
to 1
articulate 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
across 1
his 1
forehead 1
it 1
was 1
dank 1
with 1
clammy 1
sweat 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
watching 1
him 1
with 1
that 1
strange 1
expression 1
that 1
one 1
sees 1
on 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
absorbed 1
in 1
a 1
play 1
when 1
some 1
great 1
artist 1
is 1
acting 1
there 1
was 1
neither 1
real 1
sorrow 1
in 1
it 1
nor 1
real 1
joy 1
there 1
was 1
simply 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
the 1
spectator 1
with 1
perhaps 1
a 1
flicker 1
of 1
triumph 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
flower 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
was 1
smelling 1
it 1
or 1
pretending 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
what 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
cried 1
hallward 1
at 1
last 1
his 1
own 1
voice 1
sounded 1
shrill 1
and 1
curious 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
crushing 1
the 1
flower 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
you 1
met 1
me 1
flattered 1
me 1
and 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
vain 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
looks 1
one 1
day 1
you 1
introduced 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
who 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
youth 1
and 1
you 1
finished 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
revealed 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
beauty 1
in 1
a 1
mad 1
moment 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
whether 1
i 1
regret 1
or 1
not 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
wish 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
prayer 1
i 1
remember 1
it 1
oh 1
how 1
well 1
i 1
remember 1
it 1
no 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
impossible 1
the 1
room 1
is 1
damp 1
mildew 1
has 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
canvas 1
the 1
paints 1
i 1
used 1
had 1
some 1
wretched 1
mineral 1
poison 1
in 1
them 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
impossible 1
ah 1
what 1
is 1
impossible 1
murmured 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
leaning 1
his 1
forehead 1
against 1
the 1
cold 1
miststained 1
glass 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
had 1
destroyed 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
wrong 1
it 1
has 1
destroyed 1
me 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
picture 1
cant 1
you 1
see 1
your 1
ideal 1
in 1
it 1
said 1
dorian 1
bitterly 1
my 1
ideal 1
as 1
you 1
call 1
it 1
as 1
you 1
called 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
evil 1
in 1
it 1
nothing 1
shameful 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
me 1
such 1
an 1
ideal 1
as 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
meet 1
again 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
satyr 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
christ 1
what 1
a 1
thing 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
worshipped 1
it 1
has 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
a 1
devil 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
has 1
heaven 1
and 1
hell 1
in 1
him 1
basil 1
cried 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
gesture 1
of 1
despair 1
hallward 1
turned 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
portrait 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
my 1
god 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
with 1
your 1
life 1
why 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
worse 1
even 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
talk 1
against 1
you 1
fancy 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
he 1
held 1
the 1
light 1
up 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
the 1
surface 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
undisturbed 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
within 1
apparently 1
that 1
the 1
foulness 1
and 1
horror 1
had 1
come 1
through 1
some 1
strange 1
quickening 1
of 1
inner 1
life 1
the 1
leprosies 1
of 1
sin 1
were 1
slowly 1
eating 1
the 1
thing 1
away 1
the 1
rotting 1
of 1
a 1
corpse 1
in 1
a 1
watery 1
grave 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
fearful 1
his 1
hand 1
shook 1
and 1
the 1
candle 1
fell 1
from 1
its 1
socket 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
sputtering 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
then 1
he 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
rickety 1
chair 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
good 1
god 1
dorian 1
what 1
a 1
lesson 1
what 1
an 1
awful 1
lesson 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sobbing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
pray 1
dorian 1
pray 1
he 1
murmured 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
taught 1
to 1
say 1
in 1
ones 1
boyhood 1
lead 1
us 1
not 1
into 1
temptation 1
forgive 1
us 1
our 1
sins 1
wash 1
away 1
our 1
iniquities 1
let 1
us 1
say 1
that 1
together 1
the 1
prayer 1
of 1
your 1
pride 1
has 1
been 1
answered 1
the 1
prayer 1
of 1
your 1
repentance 1
will 1
be 1
answered 1
also 1
i 1
worshipped 1
you 1
too 1
much 1
i 1
am 1
punished 1
for 1
it 1
you 1
worshipped 1
yourself 1
too 1
much 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
punished 1
dorian 1
gray 1
turned 1
slowly 1
around 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
teardimmed 1
eyes 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
basil 1
he 1
faltered 1
it 1
is 1
never 1
too 1
late 1
dorian 1
let 1
us 1
kneel 1
down 1
and 1
try 1
if 1
we 1
cannot 1
remember 1
a 1
prayer 1
isnt 1
there 1
a 1
verse 1
somewhere 1
though 1
your 1
sins 1
be 1
as 1
scarlet 1
yet 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
them 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
those 1
words 1
mean 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
hush 1
dont 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
enough 1
evil 1
in 1
your 1
life 1
my 1
god 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
accursed 1
thing 1
leering 1
at 1
us 1
dorian 1
gray 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
suddenly 1
an 1
uncontrollable 1
feeling 1
of 1
hatred 1
for 1
basil 1
hallward 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
suggested 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
whispered 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
by 1
those 1
grinning 1
lips 1
the 1
mad 1
passions 1
of 1
a 1
hunted 1
animal 1
stirred 1
within 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
loathed 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
more 1
than 1
in 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
loathed 1
anything 1
he 1
glanced 1
wildly 1
around 1
something 1
glimmered 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
painted 1
chest 1
that 1
faced 1
him 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
knife 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
up 1
some 1
days 1
before 1
to 1
cut 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cord 1
and 1
had 1
forgotten 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
moved 1
slowly 1
towards 1
it 1
passing 1
hallward 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
seized 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
round 1
hallward 1
stirred 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rise 1
he 1
rushed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
dug 1
the 1
knife 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
vein 1
that 1
is 1
behind 1
the 1
ear 1
crushing 1
the 1
mans 1
head 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
stabbing 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
stifled 1
groan 1
and 1
the 1
horrible 1
sound 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
choking 1
with 1
blood 1
three 1
times 1
the 1
outstretched 1
arms 1
shot 1
up 1
convulsively 1
waving 1
grotesque 1
stifffingered 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
he 1
stabbed 1
him 1
twice 1
more 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
something 1
began 1
to 1
trickle 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
still 1
pressing 1
the 1
head 1
down 1
then 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
knife 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
listened 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
drip 1
drip 1
on 1
the 1
threadbare 1
carpet 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
absolutely 1
quiet 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
about 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
he 1
stood 1
bending 1
over 1
the 1
balustrade 1
and 1
peering 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
black 1
seething 1
well 1
of 1
darkness 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
locking 1
himself 1
in 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
still 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
straining 1
over 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
bowed 1
head 1
and 1
humped 1
back 1
and 1
long 1
fantastic 1
arms 1
had 1
it 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
the 1
red 1
jagged 1
tear 1
in 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
clotted 1
black 1
pool 1
that 1
was 1
slowly 1
widening 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
simply 1
asleep 1
how 1
quickly 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
done 1
he 1
felt 1
strangely 1
calm 1
and 1
walking 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
stepped 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
balcony 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
blown 1
the 1
fog 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
monstrous 1
peacocks 1
tail 1
starred 1
with 1
myriads 1
of 1
golden 1
eyes 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
policeman 1
going 1
his 1
rounds 1
and 1
flashing 1
the 1
long 1
beam 1
of 1
his 1
lantern 1
on 1
the 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
silent 1
houses 1
the 1
crimson 1
spot 1
of 1
a 1
prowling 1
hansom 1
gleamed 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
a 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
fluttering 1
shawl 1
was 1
creeping 1
slowly 1
by 1
the 1
railings 1
staggering 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
stopped 1
and 1
peered 1
back 1
once 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
the 1
policeman 1
strolled 1
over 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
stumbled 1
away 1
laughing 1
a 1
bitter 1
blast 1
swept 1
across 1
the 1
square 1
the 1
gaslamps 1
flickered 1
and 1
became 1
blue 1
and 1
the 1
leafless 1
trees 1
shook 1
their 1
black 1
iron 1
branches 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
he 1
shivered 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
closing 1
the 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
having 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
realize 1
the 1
situation 1
the 1
friend 1
who 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
fatal 1
portrait 1
to 1
which 1
all 1
his 1
misery 1
had 1
been 1
due 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
then 1
he 1
remembered 1
the 1
lamp 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
rather 1
curious 1
one 1
of 1
moorish 1
workmanship 1
made 1
of 1
dull 1
silver 1
inlaid 1
with 1
arabesques 1
of 1
burnished 1
steel 1
and 1
studded 1
with 1
coarse 1
turquoises 1
perhaps 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
missed 1
by 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
questions 1
would 1
be 1
asked 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
seeing 1
the 1
dead 1
thing 1
how 1
still 1
it 1
was 1
how 1
horribly 1
white 1
the 1
long 1
hands 1
looked 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
dreadful 1
wax 1
image 1
having 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
crept 1
quietly 1
downstairs 1
the 1
woodwork 1
creaked 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
pain 1
he 1
stopped 1
several 1
times 1
and 1
waited 1
no 1
everything 1
was 1
still 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
footsteps 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
coat 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
somewhere 1
he 1
unlocked 1
a 1
secret 1
press 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wainscoting 1
a 1
press 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
own 1
curious 1
disguises 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
easily 1
burn 1
them 1
afterwards 1
then 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
watch 1
it 1
was 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
to 1
two 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
every 1
yearevery 1
month 1
almostmen 1
were 1
strangled 1
in 1
england 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
madness 1
of 1
murder 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
some 1
red 1
star 1
had 1
come 1
too 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
evidence 1
was 1
there 1
against 1
him 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
at 1
eleven 1
no 1
one 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
come 1
in 1
again 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
were 1
at 1
selby 1
royal 1
his 1
valet 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
paris 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
paris 1
that 1
basil 1
had 1
gone 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
midnight 1
train 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
intended 1
with 1
his 1
curious 1
reserved 1
habits 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
months 1
before 1
any 1
suspicions 1
would 1
be 1
roused 1
months 1
everything 1
could 1
be 1
destroyed 1
long 1
before 1
then 1
a 1
sudden 1
thought 1
struck 1
him 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
fur 1
coat 1
and 1
hat 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
there 1
he 1
paused 1
hearing 1
the 1
slow 1
heavy 1
tread 1
of 1
the 1
policeman 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
outside 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
flash 1
of 1
the 1
bullseye 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
waited 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
breath 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
latch 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
very 1
gently 1
behind 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
began 1
ringing 1
the 1
bell 1
in 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
his 1
valet 1
appeared 1
halfdressed 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
drowsy 1
i 1

stayed 1

till 1

and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
catch 1
his 1
train 1

sir 1
the 1
man 1
shambled 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
in 1
his 1
slippers 1
dorian 1
gray 1
threw 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
coat 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
for 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
thinking 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
down 1
the 1
blue 1
book 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
shelves 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
alan 1
campbell 1
152 1
hertford 1
street 1
mayfair 1
yes 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
wanted 1
chapter 1
14 1
at 1
nine 1
oclock 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
his 1
servant 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
chocolate 1
on 1
a 1
tray 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
shutters 1
dorian 1
was 1
sleeping 1
quite 1
peacefully 1
lying 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
side 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
underneath 1
his 1
cheek 1
he 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
boy 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
tired 1
out 1
with 1
play 1
or 1
study 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
to 1
touch 1
him 1
twice 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
before 1
he 1
woke 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
a 1
faint 1
smile 1
passed 1
across 1
his 1
lips 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
in 1
some 1
delightful 1
dream 1
yet 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
dreamed 1
at 1
all 1
his 1
night 1
had 1
been 1
untroubled 1
by 1
any 1
images 1
of 1
pleasure 1
or 1
of 1
pain 1
but 1
youth 1
smiles 1
without 1
any 1
reason 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
chiefest 1
charms 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
leaning 1
upon 1
his 1
elbow 1
began 1
to 1
sip 1
his 1
chocolate 1
the 1
mellow 1
november 1
sun 1
came 1
streaming 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
genial 1
warmth 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
like 1
a 1
morning 1
in 1
may 1
gradually 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
crept 1
with 1
silent 1
bloodstained 1
feet 1
into 1
his 1
brain 1
and 1
reconstructed 1
themselves 1
there 1
with 1
terrible 1
distinctness 1
he 1
winced 1
at 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
same 1
curious 1
feeling 1
of 1
loathing 1
for 1
basil 1
hallward 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
kill 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
grew 1
cold 1
with 1
passion 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
was 1
still 1
sitting 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
now 1
how 1
horrible 1
that 1
was 1
such 1
hideous 1
things 1
were 1
for 1
the 1
darkness 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
brooded 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
he 1
would 1
sicken 1
or 1
grow 1
mad 1
there 1
were 1
sins 1
whose 1
fascination 1
was 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
doing 1
of 1
them 1
strange 1
triumphs 1
that 1
gratified 1
the 1
pride 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
intellect 1
a 1
quickened 1
sense 1
of 1
joy 1
greater 1
than 1
any 1
joy 1
they 1
brought 1
or 1
could 1
ever 1
bring 1
to 1
the 1
senses 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
driven 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
drugged 1
with 1
poppies 1
to 1
be 1
strangled 1
lest 1
it 1
might 1
strangle 1
one 1
itself 1
when 1
the 1
halfhour 1
struck 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
across 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
up 1
hastily 1
and 1
dressed 1
himself 1
with 1
even 1
more 1
than 1
his 1
usual 1
care 1
giving 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
choice 1
of 1
his 1
necktie 1
and 1
scarfpin 1
and 1
changing 1
his 1
rings 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
he 1
spent 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
also 1
over 1
breakfast 1
tasting 1
the 1
various 1
dishes 1
talking 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
about 1
some 1
new 1
liveries 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
getting 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
servants 1
at 1
selby 1
and 1
going 1
through 1
his 1
correspondence 1
at 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
letters 1
he 1
smiled 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
bored 1
him 1
one 1
he 1
read 1
several 1
times 1
over 1
and 1
then 1
tore 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
look 1
of 1
annoyance 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
that 1
awful 1
thing 1
a 1
womans 1
memory 1
as 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
once 1
said 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
drunk 1
his 1
cup 1
of 1
black 1
coffee 1
he 1
wiped 1
his 1
lips 1
slowly 1
with 1
a 1
napkin 1
motioned 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
to 1
wait 1
and 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wrote 1
two 1
letters 1
one 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
handed 1
to 1
the 1
valet 1
take 1
this 1
round 1
to 1
152 1
hertford 1
street 1
francis 1
and 1
if 1
mr 1
campbell 1
is 1
out 1

get 1
his 1
address 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
he 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
began 1
sketching 1
upon 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
drawing 1
first 1
flowers 1
and 1
bits 1
of 1
architecture 1
and 1
then 1
human 1
faces 1
suddenly 1
he 1
remarked 1
that 1
every 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
drew 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
fantastic 1
likeness 1
to 1
basil 1
hallward 1
he 1
frowned 1
and 1
getting 1
up 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
bookcase 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
volume 1
at 1
hazard 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
until 1
it 1
became 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
stretched 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
titlepage 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
it 1
was 1

with 1
a 1
design 1
of 1
gilt 1

and 1
dotted 1
pomegranates 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
poem 1
about 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
lacenaire 1
the 1
cold 1
yellow 1
hand 1
_du 1

with 1
its 1
downy 1
red 1
hairs 1
and 1
its 1
_doigts 1

he 1
glanced 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
white 1
taper 1
fingers 1
shuddering 1
slightly 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
those 1

exquisite 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
one 1
read 1

one 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
floating 1
down 1
the 1
green 1

of 1
the 1

city 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
black 1
gondola 1
with 1
silver 1
prow 1
and 1
trailing 1
curtains 1
the 1
mere 1
lines 1
looked 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
those 1
straight 1
lines 1
of 1
turquoiseblue 1
that 1
follow 1
one 1
as 1
one 1
pushes 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
lido 1
the 1
sudden 1
flashes 1
of 1
colour 1
reminded 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
opalandiristhroated 1
birds 1
that 1
flutter 1
round 1
the 1
tall 1

with 1
such 1
stately 1
grace 1
through 1
the 1
dim 1
duststained 1
arcades 1
leaning 1
back 1
with 1
halfclosed 1
eyes 1
he 1
kept 1
saying 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
to 1
himself 1

the 1
whole 1
of 1
venice 1
was 1
in 1
those 1
two 1
lines 1
he 1
remembered 1
the 1
autumn 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
love 1
that 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
to 1
mad 1
delightful 1
follies 1
there 1
was 1
romance 1
in 1
every 1
place 1
but 1
venice 1
like 1
oxford 1
had 1
kept 1
the 1
background 1
for 1
romance 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
true 1
romantic 1
background 1
was 1
everything 1
or 1
almost 1
everything 1
basil 1
had 1
been 1
with 1
him 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
had 1
gone 1
wild 1
over 1
tintoret 1
poor 1
basil 1
what 1
a 1
horrible 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
die 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
volume 1
again 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
forget 1
he 1
read 1
of 1
the 1
swallows 1
that 1
fly 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
_cafe_ 1
at 1
smyrna 1
where 1
the 1
hadjis 1
sit 1
counting 1
their 1
amber 1
beads 1
and 1
the 1
turbaned 1
merchants 1
smoke 1
their 1
long 1
tasselled 1
pipes 1
and 1
talk 1
gravely 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
read 1
of 1
the 1
obelisk 1
in 1
the 1
place 1
de 1
la 1
concorde 1
that 1
weeps 1
tears 1
of 1
granite 1
in 1
its 1
lonely 1
sunless 1
exile 1
and 1
longs 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
hot 1
lotuscovered 1
nile 1
where 1
there 1
are 1
sphinxes 1
and 1
rosered 1
ibises 1
and 1
white 1
vultures 1
with 1
gilded 1
claws 1
and 1
crocodiles 1
with 1
small 1
beryl 1
eyes 1
that 1
crawl 1
over 1
the 1
green 1
steaming 1
mud 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
brood 1
over 1
those 1
verses 1
which 1
drawing 1
music 1
from 1
kissstained 1
marble 1
tell 1
of 1
that 1
curious 1
statue 1
that 1
gautier 1
compares 1
to 1
a 1
contralto 1
voice 1
the 1
_monstre 1
charmant_ 1
that 1
couches 1
in 1
the 1
porphyryroom 1
of 1
the 1
louvre 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
book 1
fell 1
from 1
his 1
hand 1
he 1
grew 1
nervous 1
and 1
a 1
horrible 1
fit 1
of 1
terror 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
what 1
if 1
alan 1
campbell 1
should 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
england 1
days 1
would 1
elapse 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
come 1
back 1
perhaps 1
he 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
come 1
what 1
could 1
he 1
do 1
then 1
every 1
moment 1
was 1
of 1
vital 1
importance 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
great 1
friends 1
once 1
five 1
years 1
beforealmost 1
inseparable 1
indeed 1
then 1
the 1
intimacy 1
had 1
come 1
suddenly 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
when 1
they 1
met 1
in 1
society 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
dorian 1
gray 1
who 1
smiled 1
alan 1
campbell 1
never 1
did 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
extremely 1
clever 1
young 1
man 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
real 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
visible 1
arts 1
and 1
whatever 1
little 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
poetry 1
he 1
possessed 1
he 1
had 1
gained 1
entirely 1
from 1
dorian 1
his 1
dominant 1
intellectual 1
passion 1
was 1
for 1
science 1
at 1
cambridge 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
working 1
in 1
the 1
laboratory 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
good 1
class 1
in 1
the 1
natural 1
science 1
tripos 1
of 1
his 1
year 1
indeed 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
devoted 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
chemistry 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
laboratory 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
shut 1
himself 1
up 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
greatly 1
to 1
the 1
annoyance 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
had 1
set 1
her 1
heart 1
on 1
his 1
standing 1
for 1
parliament 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
vague 1
idea 1
that 1
a 1
chemist 1
was 1
a 1
person 1
who 1
made 1
up 1
prescriptions 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
musician 1
however 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
played 1
both 1
the 1
violin 1
and 1
the 1
piano 1
better 1
than 1
most 1
amateurs 1
in 1
fact 1
it 1
was 1
music 1
that 1
had 1
first 1
brought 1
him 1
and 1
dorian 1
gray 1
togethermusic 1
and 1
that 1
indefinable 1
attraction 1
that 1
dorian 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
exercise 1
whenever 1
he 1
wishedand 1
indeed 1
exercised 1
often 1
without 1
being 1
conscious 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
had 1
met 1
at 1
lady 1
berkshires 1
the 1
night 1
that 1
rubinstein 1
played 1
there 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
seen 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
wherever 1
good 1
music 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
for 1
eighteen 1
months 1
their 1
intimacy 1
lasted 1
campbell 1
was 1
always 1
either 1
at 1
selby 1
royal 1
or 1
in 1
grosvenor 1
square 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
many 1
others 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
the 1
type 1
of 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
wonderful 1
and 1
fascinating 1
in 1
life 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
a 1
quarrel 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
between 1
them 1
no 1
one 1
ever 1
knew 1
but 1
suddenly 1
people 1
remarked 1
that 1
they 1
scarcely 1
spoke 1
when 1
they 1
met 1
and 1
that 1
campbell 1
seemed 1
always 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
early 1
from 1
any 1
party 1
at 1
which 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
present 1
he 1
had 1
changed 1
toowas 1
strangely 1
melancholy 1
at 1
times 1
appeared 1
almost 1
to 1
dislike 1
hearing 1
music 1
and 1
would 1
never 1
himself 1
play 1
giving 1
as 1
his 1
excuse 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
absorbed 1
in 1
science 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
left 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
practise 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
certainly 1
true 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
become 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
biology 1
and 1
his 1
name 1
appeared 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
in 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
scientific 1
reviews 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
certain 1
curious 1
experiments 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
every 1
second 1
he 1
kept 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
as 1
the 1
minutes 1
went 1
by 1
he 1
became 1
horribly 1
agitated 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
pace 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
beautiful 1
caged 1
thing 1
he 1
took 1
long 1
stealthy 1
strides 1
his 1
hands 1
were 1
curiously 1
cold 1
the 1
suspense 1
became 1
unbearable 1
time 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
crawling 1
with 1
feet 1
of 1
lead 1
while 1
he 1
by 1
monstrous 1
winds 1
was 1
being 1
swept 1
towards 1
the 1
jagged 1
edge 1
of 1
some 1
black 1
cleft 1
of 1
precipice 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
there 1
saw 1
it 1
indeed 1
and 1
shuddering 1
crushed 1
with 1
dank 1
hands 1
his 1
burning 1
lids 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
robbed 1
the 1
very 1
brain 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
driven 1
the 1
eyeballs 1
back 1
into 1
their 1
cave 1
it 1
was 1
useless 1
the 1
brain 1
had 1
its 1
own 1
food 1
on 1
which 1
it 1
battened 1
and 1
the 1
imagination 1
made 1
grotesque 1
by 1
terror 1
twisted 1
and 1
distorted 1
as 1
a 1
living 1
thing 1
by 1
pain 1
danced 1
like 1
some 1
foul 1
puppet 1
on 1
a 1
stand 1
and 1
grinned 1
through 1
moving 1
masks 1
then 1
suddenly 1
time 1
stopped 1
for 1
him 1
yes 1
that 1
blind 1
slowbreathing 1
thing 1
crawled 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
horrible 1
thoughts 1
time 1
being 1
dead 1
raced 1
nimbly 1
on 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
dragged 1
a 1
hideous 1
future 1
from 1
its 1
grave 1
and 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
stared 1
at 1
it 1
its 1
very 1
horror 1
made 1
him 1
stone 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
he 1
turned 1
glazed 1
eyes 1
upon 1
him 1
mr 1
campbell 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
parched 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
cheeks 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
francis 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
himself 1
again 1
his 1
mood 1
of 1
cowardice 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
the 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
retired 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
alan 1
campbell 1
walked 1
in 1
looking 1
very 1
stern 1
and 1
rather 1
pale 1
his 1
pallor 1
being 1
intensified 1
by 1
his 1
coalblack 1
hair 1
and 1
dark 1
eyebrows 1
alan 1
this 1
is 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
coming 1
i 1
had 1
intended 1
never 1
to 1
enter 1
your 1
house 1
again 1
gray 1
but 1
you 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
hard 1
and 1
cold 1
he 1
spoke 1
with 1
slow 1
deliberation 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
contempt 1
in 1
the 1
steady 1
searching 1
gaze 1
that 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
dorian 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
his 1
astrakhan 1
coat 1
and 1
seemed 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
noticed 1
the 1
gesture 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
greeted 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
alan 1
and 1
to 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
person 1
sit 1
down 1
campbell 1
took 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
dorian 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
two 1
mens 1
eyes 1
met 1
in 1
dorians 1
there 1
was 1
infinite 1
pity 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
dreadful 1
after 1
a 1
strained 1
moment 1
of 1
silence 1
he 1
leaned 1
across 1
and 1
said 1
very 1
quietly 1
but 1
watching 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
each 1
word 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
sent 1
for 1
alan 1
in 1
a 1
locked 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
house 1
a 1
room 1
to 1
which 1
nobody 1
but 1
myself 1
has 1
access 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
is 1
seated 1
at 1
a 1
table 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
dead 1
ten 1
hours 1
now 1
dont 1
stir 1
and 1
dont 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
who 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
why 1
he 1
died 1
how 1
he 1
died 1
are 1
matters 1
that 1
do 1
not 1
concern 1
you 1

life 1

more 1
to 1

making 1
or 1
the 1
marring 1
of 1
it 1
than 1
poor 1
harry 1

the 1
same 1
murder 1
good 1
god 1
dorian 1

that 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
inform 1
upon 1
you 1

is 1
not 1
my 1
business 1
besides 1
without 1
my 1
stirring 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
you 1
are 1
certain 1
to 1
be 1
arrested 1
nobody 1
ever 1
commits 1
a 1
crime 1
without 1
doing 1
something 1
stupid 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
wait 1
wait 1
a 1
moment 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
only 1
listen 1
alan 1
all 1
i 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
to 1
perform 1
a 1
certain 1
scientific 1
experiment 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
hospitals 1
and 1
deadhouses 1
and 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
there 1
dont 1
affect 1
you 1
if 1
in 1
some 1
hideous 1
dissectingroom 1
or 1
fetid 1
laboratory 1
you 1
found 1
this 1
man 1
lying 1
on 1
a 1
leaden 1
table 1
with 1
red 1
gutters 1
scooped 1
out 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
flow 1
through 1
you 1
would 1
simply 1
look 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
an 1
admirable 1
subject 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
turn 1
a 1
hair 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
doing 1
anything 1
wrong 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
you 1
would 1
probably 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
benefiting 1
the 1
human 1
race 1
or 1
increasing 1
the 1
sum 1
of 1
knowledge 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
or 1
gratifying 1
intellectual 1
curiosity 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
merely 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
often 1
done 1
before 1
indeed 1
to 1
destroy 1
a 1
body 1
must 1
be 1
far 1
less 1
horrible 1
than 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
and 1
remember 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
piece 1
of 1
evidence 1
against 1
me 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
discovered 1
i 1
am 1
lost 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
discovered 1
unless 1
you 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
desire 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
you 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
simply 1
indifferent 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
it 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
alan 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
position 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
just 1
before 1
you 1
came 1
i 1
almost 1
fainted 1
with 1
terror 1
you 1
may 1
know 1
terror 1
yourself 1
some 1
day 1
no 1
dont 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
matter 1
purely 1
from 1
the 1
scientific 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
you 1
dont 1
inquire 1
where 1
the 1
dead 1
things 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
experiment 1
come 1
from 1
dont 1
inquire 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
too 1
much 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
i 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
we 1
were 1
friends 1
once 1
alan 1
dont 1
speak 1
about 1
those 1
days 1
dorianthey 1
are 1
dead 1
the 1
dead 1
linger 1
sometimes 1
the 1
man 1
upstairs 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
away 1
he 1
is 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
bowed 1
head 1
and 1
outstretched 1
arms 1
alan 1
alan 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
assistance 1
i 1
am 1
ruined 1
why 1
they 1
will 1
hang 1
me 1
alan 1
dont 1
you 1
understand 1
they 1
will 1
hang 1
me 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
in 1
prolonging 1
this 1
scene 1
i 1
absolutely 1
refuse 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
is 1
insane 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
you 1
refuse 1
yes 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
alan 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
the 1
same 1
look 1
of 1
pity 1
came 1
into 1
dorian 1
grays 1
eyes 1
then 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
took 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
wrote 1
something 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
read 1
it 1
over 1
twice 1
folded 1
it 1
carefully 1
and 1
pushed 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
having 1
done 1
this 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
campbell 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
surprise 1
and 1
then 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
read 1
it 1
his 1
face 1
became 1
ghastly 1
pale 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
a 1
horrible 1
sense 1
of 1
sickness 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
beating 1
itself 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
some 1
empty 1
hollow 1
after 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
of 1
terrible 1
silence 1
dorian 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
came 1
and 1
stood 1
behind 1
him 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
alan 1
he 1
murmured 1
but 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
no 1
alternative 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
letter 1
written 1
already 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
address 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
send 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
send 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
result 1
will 1
be 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
refuse 1
now 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
spare 1
you 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
me 1
the 1
justice 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
stern 1
harsh 1
offensive 1
you 1
treated 1
me 1
as 1
no 1
man 1
has 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
treat 1
meno 1
living 1
man 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
i 1
bore 1
it 1
all 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
dictate 1
terms 1
campbell 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
passed 1
through 1
him 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
turn 1
to 1
dictate 1
terms 1
alan 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
quite 1
simple 1
come 1
dont 1
work 1
yourself 1
into 1
this 1
fever 1
the 1
thing 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
face 1
it 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
a 1
groan 1
broke 1
from 1
campbells 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
shivered 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
on 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
dividing 1
time 1
into 1
separate 1
atoms 1
of 1
agony 1
each 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
too 1
terrible 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
an 1
iron 1
ring 1
was 1
being 1
slowly 1
tightened 1
round 1
his 1
forehead 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
disgrace 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
threatened 1
had 1
already 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
the 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
weighed 1
like 1
a 1
hand 1
of 1
lead 1
it 1
was 1
intolerable 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
crush 1
him 1
come 1
alan 1
you 1
must 1
decide 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
cannot 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
mechanically 1
as 1
though 1
words 1
could 1
alter 1
things 1
you 1
must 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
dont 1
delay 1
he 1
hesitated 1
a 1
moment 1
is 1
there 1
a 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
upstairs 1
yes 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
gasfire 1
with 1
asbestos 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
some 1
things 1
from 1
the 1
laboratory 1
no 1
alan 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
write 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
notepaper 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
and 1
my 1
servant 1
will 1
take 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
bring 1
the 1
things 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
campbell 1
scrawled 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
blotted 1
them 1
and 1
addressed 1
an 1
envelope 1
to 1
his 1
assistant 1
dorian 1
took 1
the 1
note 1
up 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
carefully 1
then 1
he 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
with 1
orders 1
to 1
return 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
things 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
shut 1
campbell 1
started 1
nervously 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
chair 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
chimneypiece 1
he 1
was 1
shivering 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
ague 1
for 1
nearly 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
neither 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
spoke 1
a 1
fly 1
buzzed 1
noisily 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
beat 1
of 1
a 1
hammer 1
as 1
the 1
chime 1
struck 1
one 1
campbell 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
saw 1
that 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
tears 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
purity 1
and 1
refinement 1
of 1
that 1
sad 1
face 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
enrage 1
him 1
you 1
are 1
infamous 1
absolutely 1
infamous 1
he 1
muttered 1
hush 1
alan 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
my 1
life 1
said 1
dorian 1
your 1
life 1
good 1
heavens 1
what 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
you 1
have 1
gone 1
from 1
corruption 1
to 1
corruption 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
culminated 1
in 1
crime 1
in 1
doing 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
dowhat 1
you 1
force 1
me 1
to 1
doit 1
is 1
not 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
thinking 1
ah 1
alan 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
thousandth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
pity 1
for 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
for 1
you 1
he 1
turned 1
away 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
stood 1
looking 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
garden 1
campbell 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
after 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
servant 1
entered 1
carrying 1
a 1
large 1
mahogany 1
chest 1
of 1
chemicals 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
coil 1
of 1

and 1

at 1
campbell 1
how 1
long 1
will 1
your 1
experiment 1
take 1
alan 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
calm 1
indifferent 1
voice 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
third 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
extraordinary 1
courage 1
campbell 1
frowned 1
and 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
about 1
five 1
hours 1
he 1
answered 1
it 1

i 1
shall 1
not 1
want 1

sir 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
now 1
alan 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
how 1
heavy 1
this 1
chest 1
is 1
ill 1
take 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
you 1
bring 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
he 1
spoke 1
rapidly 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
authoritative 1
manner 1
campbell 1
felt 1
dominated 1
by 1
him 1
they 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
together 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
dorian 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
then 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
a 1
troubled 1
look 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
shuddered 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
go 1
in 1
alan 1
he 1
murmured 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
dont 1
require 1
you 1
said 1
campbell 1
coldly 1
dorian 1
half 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
his 1
portrait 1
leering 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
torn 1
curtain 1
was 1
lying 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
fatal 1
canvas 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
rush 1
forward 1
when 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
what 1
was 1
that 1
loathsome 1
red 1
dew 1
that 1
gleamed 1
wet 1
and 1
glistening 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hands 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
canvas 1
had 1
sweated 1
blood 1
how 1
horrible 1
it 1
wasmore 1
horrible 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
than 1
the 1
silent 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
stretched 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
thing 1
whose 1
grotesque 1
misshapen 1
shadow 1
on 1
the 1
spotted 1
carpet 1
showed 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
stirred 1
but 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
he 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
little 1
wider 1
and 1
with 1
halfclosed 1
eyes 1
and 1
averted 1
head 1
walked 1
quickly 1
in 1
determined 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
even 1
once 1
upon 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
then 1
stooping 1
down 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
goldandpurple 1
hanging 1
he 1
flung 1
it 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
there 1
he 1
stopped 1
feeling 1
afraid 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
themselves 1
on 1
the 1
intricacies 1
of 1
the 1
pattern 1
before 1
him 1
he 1
heard 1
campbell 1
bringing 1
in 1
the 1
heavy 1
chest 1
and 1
the 1
irons 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
required 1
for 1
his 1
dreadful 1
work 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
and 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
ever 1
met 1
and 1
if 1
so 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
thought 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
leave 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
a 1
stern 1
voice 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
hurried 1
out 1
just 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
thrust 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
chair 1
and 1
that 1
campbell 1
was 1
gazing 1
into 1
a 1
glistening 1
yellow 1
face 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
downstairs 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
key 1
being 1
turned 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
it 1
was 1
long 1
after 1
seven 1
when 1
campbell 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
was 1
pale 1
but 1
absolutely 1
calm 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
what 1
you 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
muttered 1
and 1
now 1
goodbye 1
let 1
us 1
never 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
again 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
me 1
from 1
ruin 1
alan 1
i 1
cannot 1
forget 1
that 1
said 1
dorian 1
simply 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
campbell 1
had 1
left 1
he 1
went 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
smell 1
of 1
nitric 1
acid 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
gone 1
chapter 1
15 1
that 1
evening 1
at 1
eightthirty 1
exquisitely 1
dressed 1
and 1
wearing 1
a 1
large 1
buttonhole 1
of 1
parma 1
violets 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
ushered 1
into 1
lady 1
narboroughs 1
drawingroom 1
by 1
bowing 1
servants 1
his 1
forehead 1
was 1
throbbing 1
with 1
maddened 1
nerves 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
wildly 1
excited 1
but 1
his 1
manner 1
as 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
his 1
hostesss 1
hand 1
was 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
graceful 1
as 1
ever 1
perhaps 1
one 1
never 1
seems 1
so 1
much 1
at 1
ones 1
ease 1
as 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
to 1
play 1
a 1
part 1
certainly 1
no 1
one 1
looking 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
that 1
night 1
could 1
have 1
believed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
tragedy 1
as 1
horrible 1
as 1
any 1
tragedy 1
of 1
our 1
age 1
those 1
finely 1
shaped 1
fingers 1
could 1
never 1
have 1
clutched 1
a 1
knife 1
for 1
sin 1
nor 1
those 1
smiling 1
lips 1
have 1
cried 1
out 1
on 1
god 1
and 1
goodness 1
he 1
himself 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
wondering 1
at 1
the 1
calm 1
of 1
his 1
demeanour 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
felt 1
keenly 1
the 1
terrible 1
pleasure 1
of 1
a 1
double 1
life 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
party 1
got 1
up 1
rather 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
by 1
lady 1
narborough 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
clever 1
woman 1
with 1
what 1
lord 1
henry 1
used 1
to 1
describe 1
as 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
really 1
remarkable 1
ugliness 1
she 1
had 1
proved 1
an 1
excellent 1
wife 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
tedious 1
ambassadors 1
and 1
having 1
buried 1
her 1
husband 1
properly 1
in 1
a 1
marble 1
mausoleum 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
herself 1
designed 1
and 1
married 1
off 1
her 1
daughters 1
to 1
some 1
rich 1
rather 1
elderly 1
men 1
she 1
devoted 1
herself 1
now 1
to 1
the 1
pleasures 1
of 1
french 1
fiction 1
french 1
cookery 1
and 1
french 1
_esprit_ 1
when 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
it 1
dorian 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
especial 1
favourites 1
and 1
she 1
always 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
extremely 1
glad 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
met 1
him 1
in 1
early 1
life 1
i 1
know 1
my 1
dear 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
fallen 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
you 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
thrown 1
my 1
bonnet 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
mills 1
for 1
your 1
sake 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
fortunate 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
thought 1
of 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
our 1
bonnets 1
were 1
so 1
unbecoming 1
and 1
the 1
mills 1
were 1
so 1
occupied 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
even 1
a 1
flirtation 1
with 1
anybody 1
however 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
narboroughs 1
fault 1
he 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
shortsighted 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
pleasure 1
in 1
taking 1
in 1
a 1
husband 1
who 1
never 1
sees 1
anything 1
her 1
guests 1
this 1
evening 1
were 1
rather 1
tedious 1
the 1
fact 1
was 1
as 1
she 1
explained 1
to 1
dorian 1
behind 1
a 1
very 1
shabby 1
fan 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
married 1
daughters 1
had 1
come 1
up 1
quite 1
suddenly 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
matters 1
worse 1
had 1
actually 1
brought 1
her 1
husband 1
with 1
her 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
unkind 1
of 1
her 1
my 1
dear 1
she 1
whispered 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
go 1
and 1
stay 1
with 1
them 1
every 1
summer 1
after 1
i 1
come 1
from 1
homburg 1
but 1
then 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
like 1
me 1
must 1
have 1
fresh 1
air 1
sometimes 1
and 1
besides 1
i 1
really 1
wake 1
them 1
up 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
an 1
existence 1
they 1
lead 1
down 1
there 1
it 1
is 1
pure 1
unadulterated 1
country 1
life 1
they 1
get 1
up 1
early 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
so 1
little 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
there 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
scandal 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
since 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
queen 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
consequently 1
they 1
all 1
fall 1
asleep 1
after 1
dinner 1
you 1
shant 1
sit 1
next 1
either 1
of 1
them 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
and 1
amuse 1
me 1
dorian 1
murmured 1
a 1
graceful 1
compliment 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
a 1
tedious 1
party 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
consisted 1
of 1
ernest 1
harrowden 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
middleaged 1
mediocrities 1
so 1
common 1
in 1
london 1
clubs 1
who 1
have 1
no 1
enemies 1
but 1
are 1
thoroughly 1
disliked 1
by 1
their 1
friends 1
lady 1
ruxton 1
an 1
overdressed 1
woman 1
of 1
fortyseven 1
with 1
a 1
hooked 1
nose 1
who 1
was 1
always 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
herself 1
compromised 1
but 1
was 1
so 1
peculiarly 1
plain 1
that 1
to 1
her 1
great 1
disappointment 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
ever 1
believe 1
anything 1
against 1
her 1
mrs 1
erlynne 1
a 1
pushing 1
nobody 1
with 1
a 1
delightful 1
lisp 1
and 1
venetianred 1
hair 1
lady 1
alice 1
chapman 1
his 1
hostesss 1
daughter 1
a 1
dowdy 1
dull 1
girl 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
characteristic 1
british 1
faces 1
that 1
once 1
seen 1
are 1
never 1
remembered 1
and 1
her 1
husband 1
a 1
redcheeked 1
whitewhiskered 1
creature 1
who 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
his 1
class 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
inordinate 1
joviality 1
can 1
atone 1
for 1
an 1
entire 1
lack 1
of 1
ideas 1
he 1
was 1
rather 1
sorry 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
till 1
lady 1
narborough 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
ormolu 1
gilt 1
clock 1
that 1
sprawled 1
in 1
gaudy 1
curves 1
on 1
the 1
mauvedraped 1
mantelshelf 1
exclaimed 1
how 1
horrid 1
of 1
henry 1
wotton 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
late 1
i 1
sent 1
round 1
to 1
him 1
this 1
morning 1
on 1
chance 1
and 1
he 1
promised 1
faithfully 1
not 1
to 1
disappoint 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
consolation 1
that 1
harry 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
slow 1
musical 1
voice 1
lending 1
charm 1
to 1
some 1
insincere 1
apology 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
feel 1
bored 1
but 1
at 1
dinner 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
eat 1
anything 1
plate 1
after 1
plate 1
went 1
away 1
untasted 1
lady 1
narborough 1
kept 1
scolding 1
him 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
called 1
an 1
insult 1
to 1
poor 1
adolphe 1
who 1
invented 1
the 1
_menu_ 1
specially 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
across 1
at 1
him 1
wondering 1
at 1
his 1
silence 1
and 1
abstracted 1
manner 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
the 1
butler 1
filled 1
his 1
glass 1
with 1
champagne 1
he 1
drank 1
eagerly 1
and 1
his 1
thirst 1
seemed 1
to 1
increase 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
the 1
_chaudfroid_ 1
was 1
being 1
handed 1
round 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
tonight 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1

love 1
cried 1
lady 1
narborough 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
afraid 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
for 1
fear 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
jealous 1
he 1
is 1
quite 1
right 1
i 1
certainly 1
should 1
dear 1
lady 1
narborough 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
smiling 1
i 1

for 1
a 1
whole 1
weeknot 1
in 1
fact 1
since 1
madame 1
de 1
ferrol 1
left 1
town 1
how 1
you 1
men 1
can 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
that 1
woman 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
i 1
really 1
cannot 1
understand 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
simply 1
because 1
she 1
remembers 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
lady 1
narborough 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1

is 1
the 1
one 1
link 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
your 1
short 1
frocks 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
remember 1
my 1
short 1
frocks 1
at 1
all 1
lord 1
henry 1
but 1
i 1
remember 1
her 1
very 1
well 1
at 1
vienna 1
thirty 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
how 1
_decolletee_ 1
she 1
was 1
then 1
she 1
is 1
still 1
_decolletee_ 1
he 1
answered 1
taking 1
an 1
olive 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
fingers 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
smart 1
gown 1
she 1
looks 1
like 1
an 1
_edition 1
de 1
luxe_ 1
of 1
a 1
bad 1
french 1
novel 1
she 1
is 1
really 1
wonderful 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
surprises 1
her 1
capacity 1
for 1
family 1
affection 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
when 1
her 1
third 1
husband 1
died 1
her 1
hair 1
turned 1
quite 1
gold 1
from 1
grief 1
how 1
can 1

harry 1
cried 1
dorian 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
romantic 1
explanation 1
laughed 1

hostess 1
but 1
her 1
third 1
husband 1
lord 1
henry 1
you 1
dont 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
ferrol 1
is 1
the 1
fourth 1
