i 1
one 1
morning 1
when 1
gregor 1
samsa 1
woke 1
from 1
troubled 1
dreams 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
transformed 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
into 1
a 1
horrible 1
vermin 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
armourlike 1
back 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
lifted 1
his 1
head 1
a 1
little 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
brown 1
belly 1
slightly 1
domed 1
and 1
divided 1
by 1
arches 1
into 1
stiff 1
sections 1
the 1
bedding 1
was 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
cover 1
it 1
and 1
seemed 1
ready 1
to 1
slide 1
off 1
any 1
moment 1
his 1
many 1
legs 1
pitifully 1
thin 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
him 1
waved 1
about 1
helplessly 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
whats 1
happened 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
wasnt 1
a 1
dream 1
his 1
room 1
a 1
proper 1
human 1
room 1
although 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
small 1
lay 1
peacefully 1
between 1
its 1
four 1
familiar 1
walls 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
textile 1
samples 1
lay 1
spread 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
samsa 1
was 1
a 1
travelling 1
salesman 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
there 1
hung 1
a 1
picture 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
recently 1
cut 1
out 1
of 1
an 1
illustrated 1
magazine 1
and 1
housed 1
in 1
a 1
nice 1
gilded 1
frame 1
it 1
showed 1
a 1
lady 1
fitted 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
fur 1
hat 1
and 1
fur 1
boa 1
who 1
sat 1
upright 1
raising 1
a 1
heavy 1
fur 1
muff 1
that 1
covered 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
her 1
lower 1
arm 1
towards 1
the 1
viewer 1
gregor 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
dull 1
weather 1
drops 1
of 1
rain 1
could 1
be 1
heard 1
hitting 1
the 1
pane 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
quite 1
sad 1
how 1
about 1
if 1
i 1
sleep 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
longer 1
and 1
forget 1
all 1
this 1
nonsense 1
he 1
thought 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
something 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
do 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
sleeping 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
couldnt 1
get 1
into 1
that 1
position 1
however 1
hard 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
onto 1
his 1
right 1
he 1
always 1
rolled 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
tried 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
floundering 1
legs 1
and 1
only 1
stopped 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
mild 1
dull 1
pain 1
there 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
felt 1
before 1
oh 1
god 1
he 1
thought 1
what 1
a 1
strenuous 1
career 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
ive 1
chosen 1
travelling 1
day 1
in 1
and 1
day 1
out 1
doing 1
business 1
like 1
this 1
takes 1
much 1
more 1
effort 1
than 1
doing 1
your 1
own 1
business 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
that 1
theres 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
travelling 1
worries 1
about 1
making 1
train 1
connections 1
bad 1
and 1
irregular 1
food 1
contact 1
with 1
different 1
people 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
never 1
get 1
to 1
know 1
anyone 1
or 1
become 1
friendly 1
with 1
them 1
it 1
can 1
all 1
go 1
to 1
hell 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
slight 1
itch 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
belly 1
pushed 1
himself 1
slowly 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
towards 1
the 1
headboard 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
lift 1
his 1
head 1
better 1
found 1
where 1
the 1
itch 1
was 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
lots 1
of 1
little 1
white 1
spots 1
which 1
he 1
didnt 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
place 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
quickly 1
back 1
because 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
touched 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
cold 1
shudder 1
he 1
slid 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
former 1
position 1
getting 1
up 1
early 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
makes 1
you 1
stupid 1
youve 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
enough 1
sleep 1
other 1
travelling 1
salesmen 1
live 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
luxury 1
for 1
instance 1
whenever 1
i 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
guest 1
house 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
copy 1
out 1
the 1
contract 1
these 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
always 1
still 1
sitting 1
there 1
eating 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
just 1
try 1
that 1
with 1
my 1
boss 1
id 1
get 1
kicked 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
but 1
who 1
knows 1
maybe 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
have 1
my 1
parents 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
id 1
have 1
given 1
in 1
my 1
notice 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
id 1
have 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
boss 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
tell 1
him 1
everything 1
i 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
feel 1
hed 1
fall 1
right 1
off 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
its 1
a 1
funny 1
sort 1
of 1
business 1
to 1
be 1
sitting 1
up 1
there 1
at 1
your 1
desk 1
talking 1
down 1
at 1
your 1
subordinates 1
from 1
up 1
there 1
especially 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
up 1
close 1
because 1
the 1
boss 1
is 1
hard 1
of 1
hearing 1
well 1
theres 1
still 1
some 1
hope 1
once 1
ive 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
together 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
my 1
parents 1
debt 1
to 1
him 1
another 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
years 1
i 1
suppose 1
thats 1
definitely 1
what 1
ill 1
do 1
thats 1
when 1
ill 1
make 1
the 1
big 1
change 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
though 1
ive 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
my 1
train 1
leaves 1
at 1
five 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
alarm 1
clock 1
ticking 1
on 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
god 1
in 1
heaven 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
half 1
past 1
six 1
and 1
the 1
hands 1
were 1
quietly 1
moving 1
forwards 1
it 1
was 1
even 1
later 1
than 1
half 1
past 1
more 1
like 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
had 1
the 1
alarm 1
clock 1
not 1
rung 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
set 1
for 1
four 1
oclock 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
it 1
certainly 1
must 1
have 1
rung 1
yes 1
but 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
to 1
quietly 1
sleep 1
through 1
that 1
furniturerattling 1
noise 1
true 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
slept 1
peacefully 1
but 1
probably 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
deeply 1
because 1
of 1
that 1
what 1
should 1
he 1
do 1
now 1
the 1
next 1
train 1
went 1
at 1
seven 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
to 1
catch 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
rush 1
like 1
mad 1
and 1
the 1
collection 1
of 1
samples 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
packed 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
feel 1
particularly 1
fresh 1
and 1
lively 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
catch 1
the 1
train 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
avoid 1
his 1
bosss 1
anger 1
as 1
the 1
office 1
assistant 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
five 1
oclock 1
train 1
go 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
report 1
about 1
gregors 1
not 1
being 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
the 1
office 1
assistant 1
was 1
the 1
bosss 1
man 1
spineless 1
and 1
with 1
no 1
understanding 1
what 1
about 1
if 1
he 1
reported 1
sick 1
but 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
extremely 1
strained 1
and 1
suspicious 1
as 1
in 1
fifteen 1
years 1
of 1
service 1
gregor 1
had 1
never 1
once 1
yet 1
been 1
ill 1
his 1
boss 1
would 1
certainly 1
come 1
round 1
with 1
the 1
doctor 1
from 1
the 1
medical 1
insurance 1
company 1
accuse 1
his 1
parents 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
lazy 1
son 1
and 1
accept 1
the 1
doctors 1
recommendation 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
claim 1
as 1
the 1
doctor 1
believed 1
that 1
noone 1
was 1
ever 1
ill 1
but 1
that 1
many 1
were 1
workshy 1
and 1
whats 1
more 1
would 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
wrong 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
gregor 1
did 1
in 1
fact 1
apart 1
from 1
excessive 1
sleepiness 1
after 1
sleeping 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
feel 1
completely 1
well 1
and 1
even 1
felt 1
much 1
hungrier 1
than 1
usual 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
hurriedly 1
thinking 1
all 1
this 1
through 1
unable 1
to 1
decide 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
cautious 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
near 1
his 1
head 1
gregor 1
somebody 1
called 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mother 1
its 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
didnt 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
somewhere 1
that 1
gentle 1
voice 1
gregor 1
was 1
shocked 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
own 1
voice 1
answering 1
it 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
recognised 1
as 1
the 1
voice 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
before 1
as 1
if 1
from 1
deep 1
inside 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
uncontrollable 1
squeaking 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
words 1
could 1
be 1
made 1
out 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
echo 1
which 1
made 1
them 1
unclear 1
leaving 1
the 1
hearer 1
unsure 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
properly 1
or 1
not 1
gregor 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
full 1
answer 1
and 1
explain 1
everything 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
circumstances 1
contented 1
himself 1
with 1
saying 1
yes 1
mother 1
yes 1
thankyou 1
im 1
getting 1
up 1
now 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
gregors 1
voice 1
probably 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
noticed 1
outside 1
through 1
the 1
wooden 1
door 1
as 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
explanation 1
and 1
shuffled 1
away 1
but 1
this 1
short 1
conversation 1
made 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
aware 1
that 1
gregor 1
against 1
their 1
expectations 1
was 1
still 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
soon 1
his 1
father 1
came 1
knocking 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
side 1
doors 1
gently 1
but 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
gregor 1
gregor 1
he 1
called 1
whats 1
wrong 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
short 1
while 1
he 1
called 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
warning 1
deepness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
gregor 1
gregor 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
door 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
plaintively 1
gregor 1
arent 1
you 1
well 1
do 1
you 1
need 1
anything 1
gregor 1
answered 1
to 1
both 1
sides 1
im 1
ready 1
now 1
making 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
remove 1
all 1
the 1
strangeness 1
from 1
his 1
voice 1
by 1
enunciating 1
very 1
carefully 1
and 1
putting 1
long 1
pauses 1
between 1
each 1
individual 1
word 1
his 1
father 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
breakfast 1
but 1
his 1
sister 1
whispered 1
gregor 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
gregor 1
however 1
had 1
no 1
thought 1
of 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
instead 1
congratulated 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
cautious 1
habit 1
acquired 1
from 1
his 1
travelling 1
of 1
locking 1
all 1
doors 1
at 1
night 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
in 1
peace 1
without 1
being 1
disturbed 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
breakfast 1
only 1
then 1
would 1
he 1
consider 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
next 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
bring 1
his 1
thoughts 1
to 1
any 1
sensible 1
conclusions 1
by 1
lying 1
in 1
bed 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
felt 1
a 1
slight 1
pain 1
in 1
bed 1
perhaps 1
caused 1
by 1
lying 1
awkwardly 1
but 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
pure 1
imagination 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
how 1
his 1
imaginings 1
would 1
slowly 1
resolve 1
themselves 1
today 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
slightest 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
first 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
serious 1
cold 1
which 1
was 1
an 1
occupational 1
hazard 1
for 1
travelling 1
salesmen 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
simple 1
matter 1
to 1
throw 1
off 1
the 1
covers 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
to 1
blow 1
himself 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
they 1
fell 1
off 1
by 1
themselves 1
but 1
it 1
became 1
difficult 1
after 1
that 1
especially 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
exceptionally 1
broad 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
used 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
push 1
himself 1
up 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
all 1
those 1
little 1
legs 1
continuously 1
moving 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
moreover 1
unable 1
to 1
control 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
bend 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
then 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
one 1
that 1
would 1
stretch 1
itself 1
out 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
finally 1
managed 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
with 1
that 1
leg 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
set 1
free 1
and 1
would 1
move 1
about 1
painfully 1
this 1
is 1
something 1
that 1
cant 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
bed 1
gregor 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
so 1
dont 1
keep 1
trying 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
get 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
this 1
lower 1
part 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
it 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
hard 1
to 1
move 1
it 1
went 1
so 1
slowly 1
and 1
finally 1
almost 1
in 1
a 1
frenzy 1
when 1
he 1
carelessly 1
shoved 1
himself 1
forwards 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
force 1
he 1
could 1
gather 1
he 1
chose 1
the 1
wrong 1
direction 1
hit 1
hard 1
against 1
the 1
lower 1
bedpost 1
and 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
burning 1
pain 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
might 1
well 1
at 1
present 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
sensitive 1
so 1
then 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
top 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
first 1
carefully 1
turning 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
this 1
he 1
managed 1
quite 1
easily 1
and 1
despite 1
its 1
breadth 1
and 1
its 1
weight 1
the 1
bulk 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
eventually 1
followed 1
slowly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
fall 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
miracle 1
if 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
not 1
injured 1
so 1
he 1
became 1
afraid 1
to 1
carry 1
on 1
pushing 1
himself 1
forward 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
knock 1
himself 1
out 1
now 1
at 1
any 1
price 1
better 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
bed 1
than 1
lose 1
consciousness 1
it 1
took 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
effort 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
earlier 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
sighing 1
and 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
watching 1
his 1
legs 1
as 1
they 1
struggled 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
even 1
harder 1
than 1
before 1
if 1
that 1
was 1
possible 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
bringing 1
peace 1
and 1
order 1
to 1
this 1
chaos 1
he 1
told 1
himself 1
once 1
more 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
most 1
sensible 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
get 1
free 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
whatever 1
way 1
he 1
could 1
at 1
whatever 1
sacrifice 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
forget 1
to 1
remind 1
himself 1
that 1
calm 1
consideration 1
was 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
rushing 1
to 1
desperate 1
conclusions 1
at 1
times 1
like 1
this 1
he 1
would 1
direct 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
even 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
narrow 1
street 1
was 1
enveloped 1
in 1
morning 1
fog 1
and 1
the 1
view 1
had 1
little 1
confidence 1
or 1
cheer 1
to 1
offer 1
him 1
seven 1
oclock 1
already 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
when 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
again 1
seven 1
oclock 1
and 1
theres 1
still 1
a 1
fog 1
like 1
this 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
quietly 1
a 1
while 1
longer 1
breathing 1
lightly 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
perhaps 1
expected 1
the 1
total 1
stillness 1
to 1
bring 1
things 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
real 1
and 1
natural 1
state 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
before 1
it 1
strikes 1
quarter 1
past 1
seven 1
ill 1
definitely 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
got 1
properly 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
by 1
then 1
somebody 1
will 1
have 1
come 1
round 1
from 1
work 1
to 1
ask 1
whats 1
happened 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
they 1
open 1
up 1
at 1
work 1
before 1
seven 1
oclock 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
swinging 1
the 1
entire 1
length 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
if 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
falling 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
kept 1
his 1
head 1
raised 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
could 1
probably 1
avoid 1
injuring 1
it 1
his 1
back 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
hard 1
and 1
probably 1
nothing 1
would 1
happen 1
to 1
it 1
falling 1
onto 1
the 1
carpet 1
his 1
main 1
concern 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
loud 1
noise 1
he 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
make 1
and 1
which 1
even 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
doors 1
would 1
probably 1
raise 1
concern 1
if 1
not 1
alarm 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
risked 1
when 1
gregor 1
was 1
already 1
sticking 1
half 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
new 1
method 1
was 1
more 1
of 1
a 1
game 1
than 1
an 1
effort 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
rock 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
simple 1
everything 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
somebody 1
came 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
two 1
strong 1
people 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
in 1
mind 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
enough 1
they 1
would 1
only 1
have 1
to 1
push 1
their 1
arms 1
under 1
the 1
dome 1
of 1
his 1
back 1
peel 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
bend 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
load 1
and 1
then 1
be 1
patient 1
and 1
careful 1
as 1
he 1
swang 1
over 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
where 1
hopefully 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
would 1
find 1
a 1
use 1
should 1
he 1
really 1
call 1
for 1
help 1
though 1
even 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
despite 1
all 1
the 1
difficulty 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
suppress 1
a 1
smile 1
at 1
this 1
thought 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
moved 1
so 1
far 1
across 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
hard 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
balance 1
if 1
he 1
rocked 1
too 1
hard 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
now 1
ten 1
past 1
seven 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
final 1
decision 1
very 1
soon 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
thatll 1
be 1
someone 1
from 1
work 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
froze 1
very 1
still 1
although 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
only 1
became 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
lively 1
as 1
they 1
danced 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
everything 1
remained 1
quiet 1
theyre 1
not 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
gregor 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
caught 1
in 1
some 1
nonsensical 1
hope 1
but 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
maids 1
firm 1
steps 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
ever 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
gregor 1
only 1
needed 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
visitors 1
first 1
words 1
of 1
greeting 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
himself 1
why 1
did 1
gregor 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
condemned 1
to 1
work 1
for 1
a 1
company 1
where 1
they 1
immediately 1
became 1
highly 1
suspicious 1
at 1
the 1
slightest 1
shortcoming 1
were 1
all 1
employees 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
louts 1
was 1
there 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
was 1
faithful 1
and 1
devoted 1
who 1
would 1
go 1
so 1
mad 1
with 1
pangs 1
of 1
conscience 1
that 1
he 1
couldnt 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
if 1
he 1
didnt 1
spend 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
on 1
company 1
business 1
was 1
it 1
really 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trainees 1
make 1
enquiries 1
assuming 1
enquiries 1
were 1
even 1
necessary 1
did 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
himself 1
and 1
did 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
whole 1
innocent 1
family 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
so 1
suspicious 1
that 1
only 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
could 1
be 1
trusted 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
wisdom 1
to 1
investigate 1
it 1
and 1
more 1
because 1
these 1
thoughts 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
upset 1
than 1
through 1
any 1
proper 1
decision 1
he 1
swang 1
himself 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
force 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
thump 1
but 1
it 1
wasnt 1
really 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
his 1
fall 1
was 1
softened 1
a 1
little 1
by 1
the 1
carpet 1
and 1
gregors 1
back 1
was 1
also 1
more 1
elastic 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
sound 1
muffled 1
and 1
not 1
too 1
noticeable 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
held 1
his 1
head 1
carefully 1
enough 1
though 1
and 1
hit 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
fell 1
annoyed 1
and 1
in 1
pain 1
he 1
turned 1
it 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
carpet 1
somethings 1
fallen 1
down 1
in 1
there 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
gregor 1
tried 1
to 1
imagine 1
whether 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
today 1
could 1
ever 1
happen 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
too 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
concede 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
but 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
gruff 1
reply 1
to 1
this 1
question 1
the 1
chief 1
clerks 1
firm 1
footsteps 1
in 1
his 1
highly 1
polished 1
boots 1
could 1
now 1
be 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
adjoining 1
room 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
gregors 1
sister 1
whispered 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
gregor 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
is 1
here 1
yes 1
i 1
know 1
said 1
gregor 1
to 1
himself 1
but 1
without 1
daring 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
voice 1
loud 1
enough 1
for 1
his 1
sister 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
gregor 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
his 1
left 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
has 1
come 1
round 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
you 1
didnt 1
leave 1
on 1
the 1
early 1
train 1
we 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
anyway 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
personally 1
so 1
please 1
open 1
up 1
this 1
door 1
im 1
sure 1
hell 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
forgive 1
the 1
untidiness 1
of 1
your 1
room 1
then 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
called 1
good 1
morning 1
mr 1
samsa 1
he 1
isnt 1
well 1
said 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
while 1
his 1
father 1
continued 1
to 1
speak 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
isnt 1
well 1
please 1
believe 1
me 1
why 1
else 1
would 1
gregor 1
have 1
missed 1
a 1
train 1
the 1
lad 1
only 1
ever 1
thinks 1
about 1
the 1
business 1
it 1
nearly 1
makes 1
me 1
cross 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
never 1
goes 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
hes 1
been 1
in 1
town 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
now 1
but 1
stayed 1
home 1
every 1
evening 1
he 1
sits 1
with 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
just 1
reads 1
the 1
paper 1
or 1
studies 1
train 1
timetables 1
his 1
idea 1
of 1
relaxation 1
is 1
working 1
with 1
his 1
fretsaw 1
hes 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
frame 1
for 1
instance 1
it 1
only 1
took 1
him 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
evenings 1
youll 1
be 1
amazed 1
how 1
nice 1
it 1
is 1
its 1
hanging 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
youll 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
gregor 1
opens 1
the 1
door 1
anyway 1
im 1
glad 1
youre 1
here 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
gregor 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
by 1
ourselves 1
hes 1
so 1
stubborn 1
and 1
im 1
sure 1
he 1
isnt 1
well 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
morning 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
but 1
he 1
isnt 1
ill 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
said 1
gregor 1
slowly 1
and 1
thoughtfully 1
but 1
without 1
moving 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
miss 1
any 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
conversation 1
well 1
i 1
cant 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
explaining 1
it 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
i 1
hope 1
its 1
nothing 1
serious 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
people 1
in 1
commerce 1
ever 1
become 1
slightly 1
unwell 1
then 1
fortunately 1
or 1
unfortunately 1
as 1
you 1
like 1
we 1
simply 1
have 1
to 1
overcome 1
it 1
because 1
of 1
business 1
considerations 1
can 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
come 1
in 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
now 1
then 1
asked 1
his 1
father 1
impatiently 1
knocking 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
again 1
no 1
said 1
gregor 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
there 1
followed 1
a 1
painful 1
silence 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
left 1
his 1
sister 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
so 1
why 1
did 1
his 1
sister 1
not 1
go 1
and 1
join 1
the 1
others 1
she 1
had 1
probably 1
only 1
just 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
and 1
why 1
was 1
she 1
crying 1
was 1
it 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
losing 1
his 1
job 1
and 1
if 1
that 1
happened 1
his 1
boss 1
would 1
once 1
more 1
pursue 1
their 1
parents 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
demands 1
as 1
before 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
yet 1
gregor 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
intention 1
of 1
abandoning 1
his 1
family 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
he 1
just 1
lay 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
carpet 1
and 1
noone 1
who 1
knew 1
the 1
condition 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
would 1
seriously 1
have 1
expected 1
him 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
minor 1
discourtesy 1
and 1
a 1
suitable 1
excuse 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
found 1
for 1
it 1
later 1
on 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
something 1
for 1
which 1
gregor 1
could 1
be 1
sacked 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
gregor 1
much 1
more 1
sensible 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
now 1
in 1
peace 1
instead 1
of 1
disturbing 1
him 1
with 1
talking 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
crying 1
but 1
the 1
others 1
didnt 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
happening 1
they 1
were 1
worried 1
that 1
would 1
excuse 1
their 1
behaviour 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
now 1
raised 1
his 1
voice 1
mr 1
samsa 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
you 1
barricade 1
yourself 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
give 1
us 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
yes 1
or 1
no 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
you 1
are 1
causing 1
serious 1
and 1
unnecessary 1
concern 1
to 1
your 1
parents 1
and 1
you 1
fail 1
and 1
i 1
mention 1
this 1
just 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
fail 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
your 1
business 1
duties 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
unheard 1
of 1
im 1
speaking 1
here 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
and 1
of 1
your 1
employer 1
and 1
really 1
must 1
request 1
a 1
clear 1
and 1
immediate 1
explanation 1
i 1
am 1
astonished 1
quite 1
astonished 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
calm 1
and 1
sensible 1
person 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
suddenly 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
showing 1
off 1
with 1
peculiar 1
whims 1
this 1
morning 1
your 1
employer 1
did 1
suggest 1
a 1
possible 1
reason 1
for 1
your 1
failure 1
to 1
appear 1
its 1
true 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
was 1
recently 1
entrusted 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
came 1
near 1
to 1
giving 1
him 1
my 1
word 1
of 1
honour 1
that 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
right 1
explanation 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
your 1
incomprehensible 1
stubbornness 1
i 1
no 1
longer 1
feel 1
any 1
wish 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
intercede 1
on 1
your 1
behalf 1
and 1
nor 1
is 1
your 1
position 1
all 1
that 1
secure 1
i 1
had 1
originally 1
intended 1
to 1
say 1
all 1
this 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
private 1
but 1
since 1
you 1
cause 1
me 1
to 1
waste 1
my 1
time 1
here 1
for 1
no 1
good 1
reason 1
i 1
dont 1
see 1
why 1
your 1
parents 1
should 1
not 1
also 1
learn 1
of 1
it 1
your 1
turnover 1
has 1
been 1
very 1
unsatisfactory 1
of 1
late 1
i 1
grant 1
you 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
to 1
do 1
especially 1
good 1
business 1
we 1
recognise 1
that 1
but 1
there 1
simply 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
to 1
do 1
no 1
business 1
at 1
all 1
mr 1
samsa 1
we 1
cannot 1
allow 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
sir 1
called 1
gregor 1
beside 1
himself 1
and 1
forgetting 1
all 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
excitement 1
ill 1
open 1
up 1
immediately 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
im 1
slightly 1
unwell 1
an 1
attack 1
of 1
dizziness 1
i 1
havent 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
im 1
still 1
in 1
bed 1
now 1
im 1
quite 1
fresh 1
again 1
now 1
though 1
im 1
just 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
be 1
patient 1
its 1
not 1
quite 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
id 1
thought 1
im 1
quite 1
alright 1
now 1
though 1
its 1
shocking 1
what 1
can 1
suddenly 1
happen 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
alright 1
last 1
night 1
my 1
parents 1
know 1
about 1
it 1
perhaps 1
better 1
than 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
small 1
symptom 1
of 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
already 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
noticed 1
it 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
why 1
i 1
didnt 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
at 1
work 1
but 1
you 1
always 1
think 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
over 1
an 1
illness 1
without 1
staying 1
at 1
home 1
please 1
dont 1
make 1
my 1
parents 1
suffer 1
theres 1
no 1
basis 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
accusations 1
youre 1
making 1
nobodys 1
ever 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
any 1
of 1
these 1
things 1
maybe 1
you 1
havent 1
read 1
the 1
latest 1
contracts 1
i 1
sent 1
in 1
ill 1
set 1
off 1
with 1
the 1
eight 1
oclock 1
train 1
as 1
well 1
these 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
rest 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
strength 1
you 1
dont 1
need 1
to 1
wait 1
sir 1
ill 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
soon 1
after 1
you 1
and 1
please 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
that 1
to 1
the 1
boss 1
and 1
recommend 1
me 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
while 1
gregor 1
gushed 1
out 1
these 1
words 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
this 1
was 1
easily 1
done 1
probably 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
practise 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
had 1
in 1
bed 1
where 1
he 1
now 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
himself 1
upright 1
he 1
really 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
really 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
being 1
so 1
insistent 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
say 1
when 1
they 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
shocked 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
gregors 1
responsibility 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
rest 1
if 1
however 1
they 1
took 1
everything 1
calmly 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
have 1
no 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
upset 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
hurried 1
he 1
really 1
could 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
for 1
eight 1
oclock 1
the 1
first 1
few 1
times 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
climb 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
smooth 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
he 1
just 1
slid 1
down 1
again 1
but 1
he 1
finally 1
gave 1
himself 1
one 1
last 1
swing 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
upright 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
in 1
serious 1
pain 1
but 1
he 1
no 1
longer 1
gave 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
now 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
fall 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
a 1
nearby 1
chair 1
and 1
held 1
tightly 1
to 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
by 1
now 1
he 1
had 1
also 1
calmed 1
down 1
and 1
kept 1
quiet 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
listen 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
was 1
saying 1
did 1
you 1
understand 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
asked 1
his 1
parents 1
surely 1
hes 1
not 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
fools 1
of 1
us 1
oh 1
god 1
called 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
tears 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
seriously 1
ill 1
and 1
were 1
making 1
him 1
suffer 1
grete 1
grete 1
she 1
then 1
cried 1
mother 1
his 1
sister 1
called 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
they 1
communicated 1
across 1
gregors 1
room 1
youll 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
doctor 1
straight 1
away 1
gregor 1
is 1
ill 1
quick 1
get 1
the 1
doctor 1
did 1
you 1
hear 1
the 1
way 1
gregor 1
spoke 1
just 1
now 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
an 1
animal 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
with 1
a 1
calmness 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
contrast 1
with 1
his 1
mothers 1
screams 1
anna 1
anna 1
his 1
father 1
called 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
through 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
clapping 1
his 1
hands 1
get 1
a 1
locksmith 1
here 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
girls 1
their 1
skirts 1
swishing 1
immediately 1
ran 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
hall 1
wrenching 1
open 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
how 1
had 1
his 1
sister 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
so 1
quickly 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
banging 1
shut 1
again 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
left 1
it 1
open 1
people 1
often 1
do 1
in 1
homes 1
where 1
something 1
awful 1
has 1
happened 1
gregor 1
in 1
contrast 1
had 1
become 1
much 1
calmer 1
so 1
they 1
couldnt 1
understand 1
his 1
words 1
any 1
more 1
although 1
they 1
seemed 1
clear 1
enough 1
to 1
him 1
clearer 1
than 1
before 1
perhaps 1
his 1
ears 1
had 1
become 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
sound 1
they 1
had 1
realised 1
though 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
wrong 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
ready 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
first 1
response 1
to 1
his 1
situation 1
had 1
been 1
confident 1
and 1
wise 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
better 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
back 1
in 1
among 1
people 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
locksmith 1
he 1
expected 1
great 1
and 1
surprising 1
achievements 1
although 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
really 1
distinguish 1
one 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
whatever 1
was 1
said 1
next 1
would 1
be 1
crucial 1
so 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
voice 1
as 1
clear 1
as 1
possible 1
he 1
coughed 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
taking 1
care 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
not 1
too 1
loudly 1
as 1
even 1
this 1
might 1
well 1
sound 1
different 1
from 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
a 1
human 1
coughs 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
sure 1
he 1
could 1
judge 1
this 1
for 1
himself 1
meanwhile 1
it 1
had 1
become 1
very 1
quiet 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
perhaps 1
his 1
parents 1
were 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
whispering 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
or 1
perhaps 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
listening 1
gregor 1
slowly 1
pushed 1
his 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
chair 1
once 1
there 1
he 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
onto 1
the 1
door 1
holding 1
himself 1
upright 1
against 1
it 1
using 1
the 1
adhesive 1
on 1
the 1
tips 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
he 1
rested 1
there 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
to 1
recover 1
from 1
the 1
effort 1
involved 1
and 1
then 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
he 1
seemed 1
unfortunately 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
proper 1
teeth 1
how 1
was 1
he 1
then 1
to 1
grasp 1
the 1
key 1
but 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
teeth 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
strong 1
jaw 1
using 1
the 1
jaw 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
start 1
the 1
key 1
turning 1
ignoring 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
causing 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
damage 1
as 1
a 1
brown 1
fluid 1
came 1
from 1
his 1
mouth 1
flowed 1
over 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
dripped 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
listen 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
hes 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
gregor 1
was 1
greatly 1
encouraged 1
by 1
this 1
but 1
they 1
all 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
calling 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
too 1
well 1
done 1
gregor 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
cried 1
keep 1
at 1
it 1
keep 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
lock 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
excitedly 1
following 1
his 1
efforts 1
he 1
bit 1
on 1
the 1
key 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
paying 1
no 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
pain 1
he 1
was 1
causing 1
himself 1
as 1
the 1
key 1
turned 1
round 1
he 1
turned 1
around 1
the 1
lock 1
with 1
it 1
only 1
holding 1
himself 1
upright 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
hung 1
onto 1
the 1
key 1
or 1
pushed 1
it 1
down 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
weight 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
as 1
needed 1
the 1
clear 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
lock 1
as 1
it 1
snapped 1
back 1
was 1
gregors 1
sign 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
break 1
his 1
concentration 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
regained 1
his 1
breath 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
need 1
the 1
locksmith 1
after 1
all 1
then 1
he 1
lay 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
completely 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
wide 1
open 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
he 1
had 1
first 1
to 1
slowly 1
turn 1
himself 1
around 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
double 1
doors 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
very 1
carefully 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
fall 1
flat 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
before 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
occupied 1
with 1
this 1
difficult 1
movement 1
unable 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
anything 1
else 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
exclaim 1
a 1
loud 1
oh 1
which 1
sounded 1
like 1
the 1
soughing 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
now 1
he 1
also 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
nearest 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
his 1
hand 1
pressed 1
against 1
his 1
open 1
mouth 1
and 1
slowly 1
retreating 1
as 1
if 1
driven 1
by 1
a 1
steady 1
and 1
invisible 1
force 1
gregors 1
mother 1
her 1
hair 1
still 1
dishevelled 1
from 1
bed 1
despite 1
the 1
chief 1
clerks 1
being 1
there 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
father 1
then 1
she 1
unfolded 1
her 1
arms 1
took 1
two 1
steps 1
forward 1
towards 1
gregor 1
and 1
sank 1
down 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
into 1
her 1
skirts 1
that 1
spread 1
themselves 1
out 1
around 1
her 1
as 1
her 1
head 1
disappeared 1
down 1
onto 1
her 1
breast 1
his 1
father 1
looked 1
hostile 1
and 1
clenched 1
his 1
fists 1
as 1
if 1
wanting 1
to 1
knock 1
gregor 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
uncertainly 1
round 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
covered 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
wept 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
powerful 1
chest 1
shook 1
so 1
gregor 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
still 1
held 1
bolted 1
in 1
place 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
only 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
above 1
it 1
which 1
he 1
leant 1
over 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
as 1
he 1
peered 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
others 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
become 1
much 1
lighter 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
endless 1
greyblack 1
building 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
hospital 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
quite 1
clearly 1
with 1
the 1
austere 1
and 1
regular 1
line 1
of 1
windows 1
piercing 1
its 1
facade 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
still 1
falling 1
now 1
throwing 1
down 1
large 1
individual 1
droplets 1
which 1
hit 1
the 1
ground 1
one 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
washing 1
up 1
from 1
breakfast 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
it 1
because 1
for 1
gregors 1
father 1
breakfast 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
meal 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
stretch 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
reading 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
different 1
newspapers 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
exactly 1
opposite 1
there 1
was 1
photograph 1
of 1
gregor 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lieutenant 1
in 1
the 1
army 1
his 1
sword 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
carefree 1
smile 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
forth 1
respect 1
for 1
his 1
uniform 1
and 1
bearing 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
was 1
also 1
open 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
onto 1
the 1
landing 1
and 1
the 1
stairs 1
where 1
they 1
began 1
their 1
way 1
down 1
below 1
now 1
then 1
said 1
gregor 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
to 1
have 1
kept 1
calm 1
ill 1
get 1
dressed 1
straight 1
away 1
now 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
samples 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
will 1
you 1
please 1
just 1
let 1
me 1
leave 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
that 1
im 1
not 1
stubborn 1
and 1
i 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
my 1
job 1
being 1
a 1
commercial 1
traveller 1
is 1
arduous 1
but 1
without 1
travelling 1
i 1
couldnt 1
earn 1
my 1
living 1
so 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
in 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
yes 1
will 1
you 1
report 1
everything 1
accurately 1
then 1
its 1
quite 1
possible 1
for 1
someone 1
to 1
be 1
temporarily 1
unable 1
to 1
work 1
but 1
thats 1
just 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
to 1
remember 1
whats 1
been 1
achieved 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
consider 1
that 1
later 1
on 1
once 1
the 1
difficulty 1
has 1
been 1
removed 1
he 1
will 1
certainly 1
work 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
diligence 1
and 1
concentration 1
youre 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
im 1
seriously 1
in 1
debt 1
to 1
our 1
employer 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
having 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
my 1
parents 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
so 1
that 1
im 1
trapped 1
in 1
a 1
difficult 1
situation 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
work 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
again 1
please 1
dont 1
make 1
things 1
any 1
harder 1
for 1
me 1
than 1
they 1
are 1
already 1
and 1
dont 1
take 1
sides 1
against 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
office 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
nobody 1
likes 1
the 1
travellers 1
they 1
think 1
we 1
earn 1
an 1
enormous 1
wage 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
having 1
a 1
soft 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
thats 1
just 1
prejudice 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
particular 1
reason 1
to 1
think 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
you 1
sir 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
better 1
overview 1
than 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
staff 1
in 1
fact 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
this 1
in 1
confidence 1
a 1
better 1
overview 1
than 1
the 1
boss 1
himself 1
its 1
very 1
easy 1
for 1
a 1
businessman 1
like 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
mistakes 1
about 1
his 1
employees 1
and 1
judge 1
them 1
more 1
harshly 1
than 1
he 1
should 1
and 1
youre 1
also 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
we 1
travellers 1
spend 1
almost 1
the 1
whole 1
year 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
office 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
very 1
easily 1
fall 1
victim 1
to 1
gossip 1
and 1
chance 1
and 1
groundless 1
complaints 1
and 1
its 1
almost 1
impossible 1
to 1
defend 1
yourself 1
from 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
we 1
dont 1
usually 1
even 1
hear 1
about 1
them 1
or 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
its 1
when 1
we 1
arrive 1
back 1
home 1
exhausted 1
from 1
a 1
trip 1
and 1
thats 1
when 1
we 1
feel 1
the 1
harmful 1
effects 1
of 1
whats 1
been 1
going 1
on 1
without 1
even 1
knowing 1
what 1
caused 1
them 1
please 1
dont 1
go 1
away 1
at 1
least 1
first 1
say 1
something 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
you 1
grant 1
that 1
im 1
at 1
least 1
partly 1
right 1
but 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
turned 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
gregor 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
with 1
protruding 1
lips 1
only 1
stared 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
over 1
his 1
trembling 1
shoulders 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
keep 1
still 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
while 1
gregor 1
was 1
speaking 1
but 1
moved 1
steadily 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
without 1
taking 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
him 1
he 1
moved 1
very 1
gradually 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
secret 1
prohibition 1
on 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
that 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sudden 1
movement 1
drew 1
his 1
foot 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
and 1
rushed 1
forward 1
in 1
a 1
panic 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
far 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
stairway 1
as 1
if 1
out 1
there 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
supernatural 1
force 1
waiting 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
gregor 1
realised 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
go 1
away 1
in 1
this 1
mood 1
if 1
his 1
position 1
in 1
the 1
firm 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
into 1
extreme 1
danger 1
that 1
was 1
something 1
his 1
parents 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
very 1
well 1
over 1
the 1
years 1
they 1
had 1
become 1
convinced 1
that 1
this 1
job 1
would 1
provide 1
for 1
gregor 1
for 1
his 1
entire 1
life 1
and 1
besides 1
they 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
at 1
present 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
any 1
thought 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
gregor 1
though 1
did 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
future 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
back 1
calmed 1
down 1
convinced 1
and 1
finally 1
won 1
over 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
gregor 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
if 1
only 1
his 1
sister 1
were 1
here 1
she 1
was 1
clever 1
she 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
tears 1
while 1
gregor 1
was 1
still 1
lying 1
peacefully 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
was 1
a 1
lover 1
of 1
women 1
surely 1
she 1
could 1
persuade 1
him 1
she 1
would 1
close 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
and 1
talk 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
shocked 1
state 1
but 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
gregor 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
job 1
himself 1
and 1
without 1
considering 1
that 1
he 1
still 1
was 1
not 1
familiar 1
with 1
how 1
well 1
he 1
could 1
move 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
or 1
that 1
his 1
speech 1
still 1
might 1
not 1
or 1
probably 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
understood 1
he 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
pushed 1
himself 1
through 1
the 1
opening 1
tried 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
who 1
ridiculously 1
was 1
holding 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
banister 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
but 1
gregor 1
fell 1
immediately 1
over 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
scream 1
as 1
he 1
sought 1
something 1
to 1
hold 1
onto 1
landed 1
on 1
his 1
numerous 1
little 1
legs 1
hardly 1
had 1
that 1
happened 1
than 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
day 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
alright 1
with 1
his 1
body 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
had 1
the 1
solid 1
ground 1
under 1
them 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
they 1
did 1
exactly 1
as 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
even 1
making 1
the 1
effort 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
believing 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
sorrows 1
would 1
soon 1
be 1
finally 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
he 1
held 1
back 1
the 1
urge 1
to 1
move 1
but 1
swayed 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
as 1
he 1
crouched 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
at 1
first 1
quite 1
engrossed 1
in 1
herself 1
but 1
then 1
she 1
suddenly 1
jumped 1
up 1
with 1
her 1
arms 1
outstretched 1
and 1
her 1
