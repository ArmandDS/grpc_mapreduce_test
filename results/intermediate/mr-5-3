harmed 1
ourselves 1
by 1
believing 1
it 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
gregor 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
gregor 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
seen 1
long 1
ago 1
that 1
its 1
not 1
possible 1
for 1
human 1
beings 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
an 1
animal 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
carry 1
on 1
with 1
our 1
lives 1
and 1
remember 1
him 1
with 1
respect 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
animal 1
is 1
persecuting 1
us 1
its 1
driven 1
out 1
our 1
tenants 1
it 1
obviously 1
wants 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
flat 1
and 1
force 1
us 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
the 1
streets 1
father 1
look 1
just 1
look 1
she 1
suddenly 1
screamed 1
hes 1
starting 1
again 1
in 1
her 1
alarm 1
which 1
was 1
totally 1
beyond 1
gregors 1
comprehension 1
his 1
sister 1
even 1
abandoned 1
his 1
mother 1
as 1
she 1
pushed 1
herself 1
vigorously 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
more 1
willing 1
to 1
sacrifice 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
than 1
stay 1
anywhere 1
near 1
gregor 1
she 1
rushed 1
over 1
to 1
behind 1
her 1
father 1
who 1
had 1
become 1
excited 1
merely 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
stood 1
up 1
half 1
raising 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
gregors 1
sister 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
protect 1
her 1
but 1
gregor 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
intention 1
of 1
frightening 1
anyone 1
least 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
sister 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
was 1
begin 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
although 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
itself 1
quite 1
startling 1
as 1
his 1
painwracked 1
condition 1
meant 1
that 1
turning 1
round 1
required 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
effort 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
using 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
do 1
it 1
repeatedly 1
raising 1
it 1
and 1
striking 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
realised 1
his 1
good 1
intention 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
alarmed 1
briefly 1
now 1
they 1
all 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
unhappy 1
silence 1
his 1
mother 1
lay 1
in 1
her 1
chair 1
with 1
her 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
and 1
pressed 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
her 1
eyes 1
nearly 1
closed 1
with 1
exhaustion 1
his 1
sister 1
sat 1
next 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
with 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
maybe 1
now 1
theyll 1
let 1
me 1
turn 1
round 1
thought 1
gregor 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
work 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
panting 1
loudly 1
with 1
the 1
effort 1
and 1
had 1
sometimes 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
rest 1
noone 1
was 1
making 1
him 1
rush 1
any 1
more 1
everything 1
was 1
left 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
finally 1
finished 1
turning 1
round 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
straight 1
ahead 1
he 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
distance 1
that 1
separated 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
covered 1
that 1
distance 1
in 1
his 1
weak 1
state 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
before 1
and 1
almost 1
without 1
noticing 1
it 1
he 1
concentrated 1
on 1
crawling 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
and 1
hardly 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
not 1
any 1
cry 1
from 1
his 1
family 1
to 1
distract 1
him 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
his 1
head 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
doorway 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
round 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
neck 1
becoming 1
stiff 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
nonetheless 1
enough 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
nothing 1
behind 1
him 1
had 1
changed 1
only 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
stood 1
up 1
with 1
his 1
last 1
glance 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
his 1
mother 1
had 1
now 1
fallen 1
completely 1
asleep 1
he 1
was 1
hardly 1
inside 1
his 1
room 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
hurriedly 1
shut 1
bolted 1
and 1
locked 1
the 1
sudden 1
noise 1
behind 1
gregor 1
so 1
startled 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
collapsed 1
under 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
rush 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
standing 1
there 1
waiting 1
and 1
sprung 1
forward 1
lightly 1
gregor 1
had 1
not 1
heard 1
her 1
coming 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
she 1
said 1
loudly 1
to 1
her 1
parents 1
at 1
last 1
what 1
now 1
then 1
gregor 1
asked 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
he 1
soon 1
made 1
the 1
discovery 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
was 1
no 1
surprise 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
seemed 1
rather 1
that 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
actually 1
move 1
around 1
on 1
those 1
spindly 1
little 1
legs 1
until 1
then 1
was 1
unnatural 1
he 1
also 1
felt 1
relatively 1
comfortable 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
his 1
entire 1
body 1
was 1
aching 1
but 1
the 1
pain 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
slowly 1
getting 1
weaker 1
and 1
weaker 1
and 1
would 1
finally 1
disappear 1
altogether 1
he 1
could 1
already 1
hardly 1
feel 1
the 1
decayed 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
the 1
inflamed 1
area 1
around 1
it 1
which 1
was 1
entirely 1
covered 1
in 1
white 1
dust 1
he 1
thought 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
with 1
emotion 1
and 1
love 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
even 1
more 1
strongly 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
he 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
empty 1
and 1
peaceful 1
rumination 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
tower 1
strike 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
watched 1
as 1
it 1
slowly 1
began 1
to 1
get 1
light 1
everywhere 1
outside 1
the 1
window 1
too 1
then 1
without 1
his 1
willing 1
it 1
his 1
head 1
sank 1
down 1
completely 1
and 1
his 1
last 1
breath 1
flowed 1
weakly 1
from 1
his 1
nostrils 1
when 1
the 1
cleaner 1
came 1
in 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
theyd 1
often 1
asked 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
keep 1
slamming 1
the 1
doors 1
but 1
with 1
her 1
strength 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
hurry 1
she 1
still 1
did 1
so 1
that 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
knew 1
when 1
shed 1
arrived 1
and 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
usual 1
brief 1
look 1
in 1
on 1
gregor 1
and 1
at 1
first 1
found 1
nothing 1
special 1
she 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
laying 1
there 1
so 1
still 1
on 1
purpose 1
playing 1
the 1
martyr 1
she 1
attributed 1
all 1
possible 1
understanding 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
holding 1
the 1
long 1
broom 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
so 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
tickle 1
gregor 1
with 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
doorway 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
success 1
with 1
that 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
nuisance 1
of 1
herself 1
and 1
poked 1
at 1
him 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
only 1
when 1
she 1
found 1
she 1
could 1
shove 1
him 1
across 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
no 1
resistance 1
at 1
all 1
did 1
she 1
start 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
she 1
soon 1
realised 1
what 1
had 1
really 1
happened 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
wide 1
whistled 1
to 1
herself 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
waste 1
time 1
to 1
yank 1
open 1
the 1
bedroom 1
doors 1
and 1
shout 1
loudly 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
bedrooms 1
come 1
and 1
ave 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
its 1
dead 1
just 1
lying 1
there 1
stone 1
dead 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
sat 1
upright 1
there 1
in 1
their 1
marriage 1
bed 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
the 1
shock 1
caused 1
by 1
the 1
cleaner 1
before 1
they 1
could 1
grasp 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
saying 1
but 1
then 1
each 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
side 1
they 1
hurried 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
mr 1
samsa 1
threw 1
the 1
blanket 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
just 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
her 1
nightdress 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
how 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
gregors 1
room 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
where 1
grete 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
since 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
moved 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
fully 1
dressed 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
paleness 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
seemed 1
to 1
confirm 1
this 1
dead 1
asked 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
charwoman 1
enquiringly 1
even 1
though 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
checked 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
could 1
have 1
known 1
it 1
even 1
without 1
checking 1
thats 1
what 1
i 1
said 1
replied 1
the 1
cleaner 1
and 1
to 1
prove 1
it 1
she 1
gave 1
gregors 1
body 1
another 1
shove 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
sending 1
it 1
sideways 1
across 1
the 1
floor 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
made 1
a 1
movement 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
hold 1
back 1
the 1
broom 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
complete 1
it 1
now 1
then 1
said 1
mr 1
samsa 1
lets 1
give 1
thanks 1
to 1
god 1
for 1
that 1
he 1
crossed 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
women 1
followed 1
his 1
example 1
grete 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
taken 1
her 1
eyes 1
from 1
the 1
corpse 1
said 1
just 1
look 1
how 1
thin 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
didnt 1
eat 1
anything 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
the 1
food 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
went 1
in 1
gregors 1
body 1
was 1
indeed 1
completely 1
dried 1
up 1
and 1
flat 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
until 1
then 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
lifted 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
nor 1
did 1
he 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
look 1
away 1
grete 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
in 1
here 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
said 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
with 1
a 1
pained 1
smile 1
and 1
grete 1
followed 1
her 1
parents 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
but 1
not 1
without 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
body 1
the 1
cleaner 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
wide 1
although 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
had 1
something 1
of 1
warmth 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
march 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
stepped 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
in 1
amazement 1
for 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
forgotten 1
about 1
where 1
is 1
our 1
breakfast 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
asked 1
the 1
cleaner 1
irritably 1
she 1
just 1
put 1
her 1
finger 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
quick 1
and 1
silent 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
men 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
gregors 1
room 1
they 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
stood 1
around 1
gregors 1
corpse 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
their 1
wellworn 1
coats 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
quite 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
then 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
bedroom 1
opened 1
and 1
mr 1
samsa 1
appeared 1
in 1
his 1
uniform 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
on 1
one 1
arm 1
and 1
his 1
daughter 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
been 1
crying 1
a 1
little 1
grete 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
pressed 1
her 1
face 1
against 1
her 1
fathers 1
arm 1
leave 1
my 1
home 1
now 1
said 1
mr 1
samsa 1
indicating 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
without 1
letting 1
the 1
women 1
from 1
him 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
asked 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
somewhat 1
disconcerted 1
and 1
he 1
smiled 1
sweetly 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
held 1
their 1
hands 1
behind 1
their 1
backs 1
and 1
continually 1
rubbed 1
them 1
together 1
in 1
gleeful 1
anticipation 1
of 1
a 1
loud 1
quarrel 1
which 1
could 1
only 1
end 1
in 1
their 1
favour 1
i 1
mean 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
said 1
answered 1
mr 1
samsa 1
and 1
with 1
his 1
two 1
companions 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
straight 1
line 1
towards 1
the 1
man 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
still 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
rearranging 1
themselves 1
into 1
new 1
positions 1
alright 1
well 1
go 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
mr 1
samsa 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
suddenly 1
overcome 1
with 1
humility 1
and 1
wanted 1
permission 1
again 1
from 1
mr 1
samsa 1
for 1
his 1
decision 1
mr 1
samsa 1
merely 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
wide 1
and 1
briefly 1
nodded 1
to 1
him 1
several 1
times 1
at 1
that 1
and 1
without 1
delay 1
the 1
man 1
actually 1
did 1
take 1
long 1
strides 1
into 1
the 1
front 1
hallway 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
had 1
stopped 1
rubbing 1
their 1
hands 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
listening 1
to 1
what 1
was 1
being 1
said 1
now 1
they 1
jumped 1
off 1
after 1
their 1
friend 1
as 1
if 1
taken 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
fear 1
that 1
mr 1
samsa 1
might 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
hallway 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
break 1
the 1
connection 1
with 1
their 1
leader 1
once 1
there 1
all 1
three 1
took 1
their 1
hats 1
from 1
the 1
stand 1
took 1
their 1
sticks 1
from 1
the 1
holder 1
bowed 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
premises 1
mr 1
samsa 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
followed 1
them 1
out 1
onto 1
the 1
landing 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
reason 1
to 1
mistrust 1
the 1
mens 1
intentions 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
landing 1
they 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
made 1
slow 1
but 1
steady 1
progress 1
down 1
the 1
many 1
steps 1
as 1
they 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
on 1
each 1
floor 1
they 1
disappeared 1
and 1
would 1
reappear 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
the 1
further 1
down 1
they 1
went 1
the 1
more 1
that 1
the 1
samsa 1
family 1
lost 1
interest 1
in 1
them 1
when 1
a 1
butchers 1
boy 1
proud 1
of 1
posture 1
with 1
his 1
tray 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
passed 1
them 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
up 1
and 1
came 1
nearer 1
than 1
they 1
were 1
mr 1
samsa 1
and 1
the 1
women 1
came 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
landing 1
and 1
went 1
as 1
if 1
relieved 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
flat 1
they 1
decided 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
was 1
for 1
relaxation 1
and 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
not 1
only 1
had 1
they 1
earned 1
a 1
break 1
from 1
work 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
serious 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wrote 1
three 1
letters 1
of 1
excusal 1
mr 1
samsa 1
to 1
his 1
employers 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
to 1
her 1
contractor 1
and 1
grete 1
to 1
her 1
principal 1
the 1
cleaner 1
came 1
in 1
while 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
shed 1
finished 1
her 1
work 1
for 1
that 1
morning 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
first 1
just 1
nodded 1
without 1
looking 1
up 1
from 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
the 1
cleaner 1
still 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
leave 1
that 1
they 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
irritation 1
well 1
asked 1
mr 1
samsa 1
the 1
charwoman 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
on 1
her 1
face 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
tremendous 1
good 1
news 1
to 1
report 1
but 1
would 1
only 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
clearly 1
asked 1
to 1
the 1
almost 1
vertical 1
little 1
ostrich 1
feather 1
on 1
her 1
hat 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
irritation 1
to 1
mr 1
samsa 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
working 1
for 1
them 1
swayed 1
gently 1
in 1
all 1
directions 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
want 1
then 1
asked 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
whom 1
the 1
cleaner 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
respect 1
for 1
yes 1
she 1
answered 1
and 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
friendly 1
laugh 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
straight 1
away 1
well 1
then 1
that 1
thing 1
in 1
there 1
you 1
neednt 1
worry 1
about 1
how 1
youre 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
thats 1
all 1
been 1
sorted 1
out 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
and 1
grete 1
bent 1
down 1
over 1
their 1
letters 1
as 1
if 1
intent 1
on 1
continuing 1
with 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
mr 1
samsa 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
cleaner 1
wanted 1
to 1
start 1
describing 1
everything 1
in 1
detail 1
but 1
with 1
outstretched 1
hand 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
so 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
prevented 1
from 1
telling 1
them 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
suddenly 1
remembered 1
what 1
a 1
hurry 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
clearly 1
peeved 1
called 1
out 1
cheerio 1
then 1
everyone 1
turned 1
round 1
sharply 1
and 1
left 1
slamming 1
the 1
door 1
terribly 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
tonight 1
she 1
gets 1
sacked 1
said 1
mr 1
samsa 1
but 1
he 1
received 1
no 1
reply 1
from 1
either 1
his 1
wife 1
or 1
his 1
daughter 1
as 1
the 1
charwoman 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
peace 1
they 1
had 1
only 1
just 1
gained 1
they 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
where 1
they 1
remained 1
with 1
their 1
arms 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
mr 1
samsa 1
twisted 1
round 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
sat 1
there 1
watching 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
come 1
here 1
then 1
lets 1
forget 1
about 1
all 1
that 1
old 1
stuff 1
shall 1
we 1
come 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
attention 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
immediately 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
hurrying 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
where 1
they 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
hugged 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
quickly 1
finished 1
their 1
letters 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
left 1
the 1
flat 1
together 1
which 1
was 1
something 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
for 1
months 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
tram 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
outside 1
the 1
town 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
tram 1
filled 1
with 1
warm 1
sunshine 1
all 1
to 1
themselves 1
leant 1
back 1
comfortably 1
on 1
their 1
seats 1
they 1
discussed 1
their 1
prospects 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
on 1
closer 1
examination 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
bad 1
until 1
then 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
asked 1
each 1
other 1
about 1
their 1
work 1
but 1
all 1
three 1
had 1
jobs 1
which 1
were 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
held 1
particularly 1
good 1
promise 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
the 1
greatest 1
improvement 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
of 1
course 1
would 1
be 1
achieved 1
quite 1
easily 1
by 1
moving 1
house 1
what 1
they 1
needed 1
now 1
was 1
a 1
flat 1
that 1
was 1
smaller 1
and 1
cheaper 1
than 1
the 1
current 1
one 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
chosen 1
by 1
gregor 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
better 1
location 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
more 1
practical 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
grete 1
was 1
becoming 1
livelier 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
worry 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
having 1
of 1
late 1
her 1
cheeks 1
had 1
become 1
pale 1
but 1
while 1
they 1
were 1
talking 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
samsa 1
were 1
struck 1
almost 1
simultaneously 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
how 1
their 1
daughter 1
was 1
blossoming 1
into 1
a 1
well 1
built 1
and 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
they 1
became 1
quieter 1
just 1
from 1
each 1
others 1
glance 1
and 1
almost 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
soon 1
be 1
time 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
confirmation 1
of 1
their 1
new 1
dreams 1
and 1
good 1
intentions 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
reached 1
their 1
destination 1
grete 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
stretch 1
out 1
her 1
young 1
body 1
