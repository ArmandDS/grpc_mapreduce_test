no 1
difference 1
after 1
the 1
row 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
weve 1
served 1
him 1
shores 1
youre 1
born 1
hell 1
turn 1
states 1
evidence 1
now 1
you 1
hear 1
_me_ 1
im 1
for 1
putting 1
him 1
out 1
of 1

very 1
quiet 1
blame 1

id 1
sorter 1
begun 1
to 1
think 1
you 1
wasnt 1

then 1
thats 1
all 1
right 1
les 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
hold 1
on 1
a 1
minute 1
i 1
haint 1
had 1
my 1
say 1
yit 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
shootings 1
good 1
but 1
theres 1
quieter 1
ways 1
if 1
the 1
things 1
_got_ 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
is 1
this 1
it 1
aint 1
good 1
sense 1
to 1
go 1
courtn 1
around 1
after 1
a 1
halter 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
git 1
at 1
what 1
youre 1
up 1
to 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
thats 1
jist 1
as 1
good 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
dont 1
bring 1
you 1
into 1
no 1
resks 1
aint 1
that 1
so 1
you 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
how 1
you 1
goin 1
to 1
manage 1
it 1
this 1
time 1
well 1
my 1
idea 1
is 1
this 1
well 1
rustle 1
around 1
and 1
gather 1
up 1
whatever 1
pickins 1
weve 1
overlooked 1
in 1
the 1
staterooms 1
and 1
shove 1
for 1
shore 1
and 1
hide 1
the 1
truck 1
then 1
well 1
wait 1
now 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
aint 1
agoin 1
to 1
be 1
moren 1
two 1
hours 1
befo 1
this 1
wrack 1
breaks 1
up 1
and 1
washes 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
see 1
hell 1
be 1
drownded 1
and 1
wont 1
have 1
nobody 1
to 1
blame 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
i 1
reckon 1
thats 1
a 1
considerble 1
sight 1
better 1
n 1
killin 1
of 1
him 1
im 1
unfavorable 1
to 1
killin 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
git 1
aroun 1
it 1
it 1
aint 1
good 1
sense 1
it 1
aint 1
good 1
morals 1
aint 1
i 1
right 1

can 1
wait 1

two 1
hours 1
anyway 1
and 1
see 1
cant 1
we 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
come 1
along 1
so 1
they 1
started 1

i 1
lit 1

in 1
a 1
cold 1
sweat 1
and 1
scrambled 1

a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
coarse 1

right 1
at 1
my 1

of 1
a 1
moan 1

we 1
went 1
aquaking 1
and 1
shaking 1
down 1
the 1
stabboard 1
side 1
and 1
slow 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
tooseemed 1
a 1
week 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
stern 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
boat 1
jim 1
said 1
he 1
didnt 1
believe 1

hardly 1

we 1
get 1
left 1
on 1
this 1
wreck 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
fix 1
sure 1
so 1
on 1
we 1
prowled 1
again 1
we 1
struck 1
for 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
texas 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
scrabbled 1
along 1
forwards 1
on 1
the 1
skylight 1
hanging 1
on 1
from 1
shutter 1
to 1
shutter 1
for 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
skylight 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
crosshall 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
skiff 1
sure 1
enough 1
i 1
could 1
just 1
barely 1
see 1
her 1
i 1
felt 1
ever 1
so 1
thankful 1
in 1
another 1
second 1
i 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
aboard 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
just 1
then 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
stuck 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
only 1
about 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
foot 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
he 1
jerked 1
it 1
in 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
heave 1
that 1
blame 1
lantern 1
out 1
o 1
sight 1
bill 1
he 1
flung 1
a 1
bag 1
of 1
something 1
into 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
in 1
himself 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
it 1
was 1
packard 1
then 1
bill 1
_he_ 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
in 1
packard 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
all 1
readyshove 1
off 1
i 1
couldnt 1
hardly 1
hang 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
shutters 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
weak 1
but 1
bill 1
says 1
hold 1
ond 1
you 1
go 1
through 1
him 1
no 1
didnt 1
you 1
no 1
so 1
hes 1
got 1
his 1
share 1
o 1
the 1
cash 1
yet 1
well 1
then 1

along 1
no 1

to 1
take 1
truck 1
and 1
leave 1
money 1
say 1
wont 1
he 1
suspicion 1
what 1
were 1
up 1
to 1
maybe 1
he 1
wont 1
but 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
anyway 1
come 1
along 1
so 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
slammed 1
to 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
careened 1
side 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
half 1
second 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
jim 1
come 1
tumbling 1
after 1
me 1
i 1
out 1
with 1
my 1
knife 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
we 1
didnt 1
touch 1
an 1
oar 1
and 1
we 1
didnt 1
speak 1
nor 1
whisper 1
nor 1
hardly 1
even 1
breathe 1
we 1
went 1
gliding 1
swift 1
along 1
dead 1
silent 1
past 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
the 1
paddlebox 1
and 1
past 1
the 1
stern 1
then 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
more 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
below 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
the 1
darkness 1
soaked 1
her 1
up 1
every 1
last 1
sign 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
safe 1
and 1
knowed 1
it 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
hundred 1
yards 1
downstream 1
we 1
see 1
the 1
lantern 1
show 1
like 1
a 1
little 1
spark 1
at 1
the 1
texas 1
door 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
we 1
knowed 1
by 1
that 1
that 1
the 1
rascals 1
had 1
missed 1
their 1
boat 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
they 1
was 1
in 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
trouble 1
now 1
as 1
jim 1
turner 1
was 1
then 1
jim 1
manned 1
the 1
oars 1
and 1
we 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
our 1
raft 1
now 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
the 1
meni 1
reckon 1
i 1
hadnt 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
before 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
think 1
how 1
dreadful 1
it 1
was 1
even 1
for 1
murderers 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
fix 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
there 1
aint 1
no 1
telling 1
but 1
i 1
might 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
murderer 1
myself 1
yet 1
and 1
then 1
how 1
would 1
i 1
like 1
it 1
so 1
says 1
i 1
to 1
jim 1
the 1
first 1
light 1
we 1
see 1
well 1
land 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
below 1
it 1
or 1
above 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
its 1
a 1
good 1
hidingplace 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
then 1
ill 1
go 1
and 1
fix 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
yarn 1
and 1
get 1
somebody 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
that 1
gang 1
and 1
get 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
scrape 1
so 1
they 1
can 1
be 1
hung 1
when 1
their 1
time 1
comes 1
but 1
that 1
idea 1
was 1
a 1
failure 1
for 1
pretty 1
soon 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
storm 1
again 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
worse 1
than 1
ever 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
and 1
never 1
a 1
light 1
showed 1
everybody 1
in 1
bed 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
boomed 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
watching 1
for 1
lights 1
and 1
watching 1
for 1
our 1
raft 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
rain 1
let 1
up 1
but 1
the 1
clouds 1
stayed 1
and 1
the 1

corner 1
i 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
skiff 1
and 1
bailed 1
her 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
pulled 1
up 1
shore 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
about 1
six 1
hundred 1
yards 1
and 1
tucked 1
myself 1
in 1
among 1
some 1
woodboats 1
for 1
i 1
couldnt 1
rest 1
easy 1
till 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
start 1
but 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
around 1
i 1
was 1
feeling 1
ruther 1
comfortable 1
on 1
accounts 1
of 1
taking 1
all 1
this 1
trouble 1
for 1
that 1
gang 1
for 1
not 1
many 1
would 1
a 1
done 1
it 1
i 1
wished 1
the 1
widow 1
knowed 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
judged 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
proud 1
of 1
me 1
for 1
helping 1
these 1
rapscallions 1
because 1
rapscallions 1
and 1
dead 1
beats 1
is 1
the 1
kind 1
the 1
widow 1
and 1
good 1
people 1
takes 1
the 1
most 1
interest 1
in 1
well 1
before 1
long 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
wreck 1
dim 1
and 1
dusky 1
sliding 1
along 1
down 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
cold 1
shiver 1
went 1
through 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
deep 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
there 1
warnt 1
much 1
chance 1
for 1
anybody 1
being 1
alive 1
in 1
her 1
i 1
pulled 1
all 1
around 1
her 1
and 1
hollered 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
there 1
wasnt 1
any 1
answer 1
all 1
dead 1
still 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
heavyhearted 1
about 1
the 1
gang 1
but 1
not 1
much 1
for 1
i 1
reckoned 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
i 1
could 1
then 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
so 1
i 1
shoved 1
for 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
downstream 1
slant 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
eyereach 1
i 1
laid 1
on 1
my 1
oars 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
go 1
and 1
smell 1
around 1
the 1
wreck 1
for 1
miss 1
hookers 1
remainders 1
because 1
the 1
captain 1
would 1
know 1
her 1
uncle 1
hornback 1
would 1
want 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
i 1
laid 1
into 1
my 1
work 1
and 1
went 1
abooming 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
it 1
did 1
seem 1
a 1
powerful 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
jims 1
light 1
showed 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
did 1
show 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
thousand 1
mile 1
off 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
got 1
there 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
little 1
gray 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
so 1
we 1
struck 1
for 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
sunk 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
turned 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
like 1
dead 1
people 1
chapter 1
xiv 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
up 1
we 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
truck 1
the 1
gang 1
had 1
stole 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
found 1
boots 1
and 1
blankets 1
and 1
clothes 1
and 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
other 1
things 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
books 1
and 1
a 1
spyglass 1
and 1
three 1
boxes 1
of 1
seegars 1
we 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
been 1
this 1
rich 1
before 1
in 1
neither 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
the 1
seegars 1
was 1
prime 1
we 1
laid 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
talking 1
and 1
me 1
reading 1
the 1
books 1
and 1
having 1
a 1
general 1
good 1
time 1
i 1
told 1
jim 1
all 1
about 1
what 1

inside 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
at 1
the 1

when 1
i 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
texas 1
and 1
he 1
crawled 1
back 1
to 1
get 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
found 1
her 1
gone 1
he 1
nearly 1
died 1
because 1
he 1
judged 1
it 1

all 1
up 1
with 1
_him_ 1
anyway 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
fixed 1
for 1
if 1

would 1
get 1
drownded 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
get 1
saved 1
whoever 1
saved 1
him 1
would 1
send 1
him 1
back 1
home 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
reward 1
and 1
then 1
miss 1

cairo 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
illinois 1
where 1
the 1
ohio 1
river 1
comes 1
in 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
we 1
was 1
after 1
we 1
would 1
sell 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
get 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
and 1
go 1
way 1
up 1
the 1
ohio 1
amongst 1
the 1
free 1
states 1
and 1
then 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
trouble 1
well 1
the 1
second 1
night 1
a 1
fog 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
and 1
we 1
made 1
for 1
a 1
towhead 1
to 1
tie 1
to 1
for 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
do 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
run 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
paddled 1
ahead 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
with 1
the 1
line 1
to 1
make 1
fast 1
there 1
warnt 1
anything 1
but 1
little 1
saplings 1
to 1
tie 1
to 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
line 1
around 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
right 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
cut 1
bank 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
stiff 1
current 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
come 1
booming 1
down 1
so 1
lively 1
she 1
tore 1
it 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
roots 1
and 1
away 1
she 1
went 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
fog 1
closing 1
down 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
so 1
sick 1
and 1
scared 1
i 1
couldnt 1
budge 1
for 1
most 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
meand 1
then 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
raft 1
in 1
sight 1
you 1
couldnt 1
see 1
twenty 1
yards 1
i 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
run 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
stern 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
paddle 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
back 1
a 1
stroke 1
but 1
she 1
didnt 1
come 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
i 1
hadnt 1
untied 1
her 1
i 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
untie 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
my 1
hands 1
shook 1
so 1
i 1
couldnt 1
hardly 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
got 1
started 1
i 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
the 1
raft 1
hot 1
and 1
heavy 1
right 1
down 1
the 1
towhead 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
went 1
but 1
the 1
towhead 1
warnt 1
sixty 1
yards 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
i 1
flew 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
shot 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
solid 1
white 1
fog 1
and 1
hadnt 1
no 1
more 1
idea 1
which 1
way 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
than 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
thinks 1
i 1
it 1
wont 1
do 1
to 1
paddle 1
first 1
i 1
know 1
ill 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
bank 1
or 1
a 1
towhead 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
still 1
and 1
float 1
and 1
yet 1
its 1
mighty 1
fidgety 1
business 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
hold 1
your 1
hands 1
still 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
whooped 1
and 1
listened 1
away 1
down 1
there 1
somewheres 1
i 1
hears 1
a 1
small 1
whoop 1
and 1
up 1
comes 1
my 1
spirits 1
i 1
went 1
tearing 1
after 1
it 1
listening 1
sharp 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
it 1
come 1
i 1
see 1
i 1
warnt 1
heading 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
heading 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
heading 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
itand 1
not 1
gaining 1
on 1
it 1
much 1
either 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
flying 1
around 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
and 1
tother 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
straight 1
ahead 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
did 1
wish 1
the 1
fool 1
would 1
think 1
to 1
beat 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
and 1
beat 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
still 1
places 1
between 1
the 1
whoops 1
that 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
trouble 1
for 1
me 1
well 1
i 1
fought 1
along 1
and 1
directly 1
i 1
hears 1
the 1
whoop 1
_behind_ 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
tangled 1
good 1
now 1
that 1
was 1
somebody 1
elses 1
whoop 1
or 1
else 1
i 1
was 1
turned 1
around 1
i 1
throwed 1
the 1
paddle 1
down 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
whoop 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
yet 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
place 1
it 1
kept 1
coming 1
and 1
kept 1
changing 1
its 1
place 1
and 1
i 1
kept 1
answering 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
knowed 1
the 1
current 1
had 1
swung 1
the 1
canoes 1
head 1
downstream 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
if 1
that 1
was 1
jim 1
and 1
not 1
some 1
other 1
raftsman 1
hollering 1
i 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
nothing 1
about 1
voices 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
for 1
nothing 1
dont 1
look 1
natural 1
nor 1
sound 1
natural 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
the 1
whooping 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
i 1
come 1
abooming 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
cut 1
bank 1
with 1
smoky 1
ghosts 1
of 1
big 1
trees 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
current 1
throwed 1
me 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
and 1
shot 1
by 1
amongst 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
snags 1
that 1
fairly 1
roared 1
the 1
currrent 1
was 1
tearing 1
by 1
them 1
so 1
swift 1
in 1
another 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
it 1
was 1
solid 1
white 1
and 1
still 1
again 1
i 1
set 1
perfectly 1
still 1
then 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
thump 1
and 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
didnt 1
draw 1
a 1
breath 1
while 1
it 1
thumped 1
a 1
hundred 1
i 1
just 1
give 1
up 1
then 1
i 1
knowed 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
that 1
cut 1
bank 1
was 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
jim 1
had 1
gone 1
down 1
tother 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
towhead 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
float 1
by 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
it 1
had 1
the 1
big 1
timber 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
island 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
i 1
kept 1
quiet 1
with 1
my 1
ears 1
cocked 1
about 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
was 1
floating 1
along 1
of 1
course 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
but 1
you 1
dont 1
ever 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
no 1
you 1
_feel_ 1
like 1
you 1
are 1
laying 1
dead 1
still 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
a 1
snag 1
slips 1
by 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
to 1
yourself 1
how 1
fast 1
_youre_ 1
going 1
but 1
you 1
catch 1
your 1
breath 1
and 1
think 1
my 1
how 1
that 1
snags 1
tearing 1
along 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
aint 1
dismal 1
and 1
lonesome 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
that 1
way 1
by 1
yourself 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
try 1
it 1
onceyoull 1
see 1
next 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
i 1
whoops 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
hears 1
the 1
answer 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
off 1
and 1
tries 1
to 1
follow 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
directly 1
i 1
judged 1
id 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
nest 1
of 1
towheads 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
little 1
dim 1
glimpses 1
of 1
them 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
of 1
mesometimes 1
just 1
a 1
narrow 1
channel 1
between 1
and 1
some 1
that 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
i 1
knowed 1
was 1
there 1
because 1
id 1
hear 1
the 1
wash 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
against 1
the 1
old 1
dead 1
brush 1
and 1
trash 1
that 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
banks 1
well 1
i 1
warnt 1
long 1
loosing 1
the 1
whoops 1
down 1
amongst 1
the 1
towheads 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
tried 1
to 1
chase 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
anyway 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
worse 1
than 1
chasing 1
a 1
jackolantern 1
you 1
never 1
knowed 1
a 1
sound 1
dodge 1
around 1
so 1
and 1
swap 1
places 1
so 1
quick 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
claw 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
bank 1
pretty 1
lively 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
times 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
knocking 1
the 1
islands 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
judged 1
the 1
raft 1
must 1
be 1
butting 1
into 1
the 1
bank 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
or 1
else 1
it 1
would 1
get 1
further 1
ahead 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
hearingit 1
was 1
floating 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
than 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
well 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
river 1
again 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
hear 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
whoop 1
nowheres 1
i 1
reckoned 1
jim 1
had 1
fetched 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
snag 1
maybe 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
up 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
tired 1
so 1
i 1
laid 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
bother 1
no 1
more 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
sleepy 1
i 1
couldnt 1
help 1
it 1
so 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
would 1
take 1
jest 1
one 1
little 1
catnap 1
but 1
i 1
reckon 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
catnap 1
for 1
when 1
i 1
waked 1
up 1
the 1
stars 1
was 1
shining 1
bright 1
the 1
fog 1
was 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
spinning 1
down 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
stern 1
first 1
first 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
was 1
dreaming 1
and 1
when 1
things 1
began 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
dim 1
out 1
of 1
last 1
week 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
monstrous 1
big 1
river 1
here 1
with 1
the 1
tallest 1
and 1
the 1
thickest 1
kind 1
of 1
timber 1
on 1
both 1
banks 1
just 1
a 1
solid 1
wall 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
stars 1
i 1
looked 1
away 1
downstream 1
and 1
seen 1
a 1
black 1
speck 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
took 1
after 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
it 1
warnt 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
sawlogs 1
made 1
fast 1
together 1
then 1
i 1
see 1
another 1
speck 1
and 1
chased 1
that 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
raft 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
jim 1
was 1
setting 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
hanging 1
over 1
the 1
steeringoar 1
the 1
other 1
oar 1
was 1
smashed 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
littered 1
up 1
with 1
leaves 1
and 1
branches 1
and 1
dirt 1
so 1
shed 1

a 1
rough 1
time 1

the 1
whoops 1
was 1
warnings 1
that 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
didnt 1
try 1
hard 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
theyd 1
just 1
take 1

with 1
quarrelsome 1
people 1

mean 1
folks 1
but 1
if 1
we 1
minded 1
our 1
business 1
and 1
didnt 1
talk 1
back 1
and 1
aggravate 1
them 1
we 1
would 1
pull 1
through 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
big 1
clear 1
river 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
free 1
states 1
and 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1

clouded 1
up 1
pretty 1
dark 1
just 1
after 1

what 1

raft 1
and 1
the 1
smashed 1
oar 1

at 1
the 1
trash 1
again 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
dream 1
fixed 1
so 1
strong 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
loose 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
facts 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
again 1
right 1
away 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
did 1
get 1
the 1
thing 1
straightened 1
around 1

looked 1
at 1

he 1
got 1
up 1
slow 1
and 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
there 1
without 1
saying 1
anything 1

i 1
wouldnt 1
done 1
that 1
one 1
if 1
id 1
a 1
knowed 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
feel 1
that 1
way 1
chapter 1
xvi 1
we 1
slept 1
most 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
started 1
out 1
at 1
night 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
behind 1
a 1
monstrous 1
long 1
raft 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
going 1
by 1
as 1
a 1
procession 1
she 1
had 1
four 1
long 1
sweeps 1
at 1
each 1
end 1
so 1
we 1
judged 1
she 1
carried 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
thirty 1
men 1
likely 1
she 1
had 1
five 1
big 1
wigwams 1
aboard 1
wide 1
apart 1
and 1
an 1
open 1
camp 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
flagpole 1
at 1
each 1
end 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
style 1
about 1
her 1
it 1
_amounted_ 1
to 1
something 1
being 1
a 1
raftsman 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
craft 1
as 1
that 1
we 1
went 1
drifting 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
and 1
the 1
night 1
clouded 1
up 1
and 1
got 1
hot 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
very 1
wide 1
and 1
was 1
walled 1
with 1
solid 1
timber 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
you 1
couldnt 1
see 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
it 1
hardly 1
ever 1
or 1
a 1
light 1
we 1
talked 1
about 1
cairo 1
and 1
wondered 1
whether 1
we 1
would 1
know 1
it 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
i 1
said 1
likely 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
because 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
say 1
there 1
warnt 1
but 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
houses 1
there 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
didnt 1
happen 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
lit 1
up 1
how 1
was 1
we 1
going 1
to 1
know 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
town 1
jim 1
said 1
if 1
the 1
two 1
big 1
rivers 1
joined 1
together 1
there 1
that 1
would 1
show 1
but 1
i 1
said 1
maybe 1
we 1
might 1
think 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
old 1
river 1
again 1
that 1
disturbed 1
jimand 1
me 1
too 1
so 1
the 1
question 1
was 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
said 1
paddle 1
ashore 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
a 1
light 1
showed 1
and 1
tell 1
them 1
pap 1
was 1
behind 1
coming 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
tradingscow 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
green 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
business 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
far 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
cairo 1
jim 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
so 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
smoke 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
waited 1
there 1
warnt 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
but 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
sharp 1
for 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
not 1
pass 1
it 1
without 1
seeing 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
hed 1
be 1
mighty 1
sure 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
because 1
hed 1
be 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
missed 1
it 1
hed 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
slave 1
country 1
again 1
and 1
no 1
more 1
show 1
for 1
freedom 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
jumps 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
dah 1
she 1
is 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
it 1
was 1
jackolanterns 1
or 1
lightning 1
bugs 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
watching 1
same 1
as 1
before 1
jim 1
said 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
trembly 1
and 1
feverish 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
freedom 1
well 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
all 1
over 1
trembly 1
and 1
feverish 1
too 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
because 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
through 1
my 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
_was_ 1
most 1
freeand 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
for 1
it 1
why 1
_me_ 1
i 1
couldnt 1
get 1
that 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
conscience 1
no 1
how 1
nor 1
no 1
way 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
troubling 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
couldnt 1
rest 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stay 1
still 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
it 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
me 1
before 1
what 1
this 1
thing 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
did 1
and 1
it 1
stayed 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
scorched 1
me 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
to 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
warnt 1
to 1
blame 1
because 1
i 1
didnt 1
run 1
jim 1
off 1
from 1
his 1
rightful 1
owner 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
conscience 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
every 1
time 1
but 1
you 1
knowed 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
for 1
his 1
freedom 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
paddled 1
ashore 1
and 1
told 1
somebody 1
that 1
was 1
soi 1
couldnt 1
get 1
around 1
that 1
noway 1
that 1
was 1
where 1
it 1
pinched 1
conscience 1
says 1
to 1
me 1
what 1
had 1
poor 1
miss 1
watson 1
done 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
her 1
nigger 1
go 1
off 1
right 1
under 1
your 1
eyes 1
and 1
never 1
say 1
one 1
single 1
word 1
what 1
did 1
that 1
poor 1
old 1
woman 1
do 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
treat 1
her 1
so 1
mean 1
why 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
learn 1
you 1
your 1
book 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
learn 1
you 1
your 1
manners 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
to 1
you 1
every 1
way 1
she 1
knowed 1
how 1
_thats_ 1
what 1
she 1
done 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
feeling 1
so 1
mean 1
and 1
so 1
miserable 1
i 1
most 1
wished 1
i 1
was 1
dead 1
i 1
fidgeted 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
raft 1
abusing 1
myself 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
jim 1
was 1
fidgeting 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
past 1
me 1
we 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
keep 1
still 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
danced 1
around 1
and 1
says 1
dahs 1
cairo 1
it 1
went 1
through 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
shot 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
if 1
it 1
_was_ 1
cairo 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
die 1
of 1
miserableness 1
jim 1
talked 1
out 1
loud 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
talking 1
to 1
myself 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
how 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
a 1
free 1
state 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
saving 1
up 1
money 1
and 1
never 1
spend 1
a 1
single 1
cent 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
enough 1
he 1
would 1
buy 1
his 1
wife 1
which 1
was 1
owned 1
on 1
a 1
farm 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
miss 1
watson 1
lived 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
both 1
work 1
to 1
buy 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
master 1
wouldnt 1
sell 1
them 1
theyd 1
get 1
an 1
ablitionist 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
steal 1
them 1
it 1
most 1
froze 1
me 1
to 1
hear 1
such 1
talk 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
talk 1
such 1
talk 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
before 1
just 1
see 1
what 1
a 1
difference 1
it 1
made 1
in 1
him 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
judged 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
free 1
it 1
was 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
saying 1
give 1
a 1
nigger 1
an 1
inch 1
and 1
hell 1
take 1
an 1
ell 1
thinks 1
i 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
comes 1
of 1
my 1
not 1
thinking 1
here 1
was 1
this 1
nigger 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
helped 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
coming 1
right 1
out 1
flatfooted 1
and 1
saying 1
he 1
would 1
steal 1
his 1
childrenchildren 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
i 1
didnt 1
even 1
know 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
done 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
i 1
was 1
sorry 1
to 1
hear 1
jim 1
say 1
that 1
it 1

such 1
a 1
lowering 1
of 1
him 1
my 1
conscience 1
got 1
to 1
stirring 1
me 1
up 1

jim 1
was 1
mighty 1
particular 1
about 1
hiding 1
the 1
raft 1
good 1
then 1
he 1
worked 1
all 1
day 1
fixing 1
things 1
in 1
bundles 1
and 1
getting 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
quit 1
rafting 1
that 1

we 1
hove 1
in 1

of 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
a 1
town 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
lefthand 1
bend 1
i 1
went 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
to 1
ask 1
about 1
it 1
pretty 1
soon 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
man 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
a 1
skiff 1
setting 1
a 1
trotline 1
i 1
ranged 1
up 1
and 1

i 1
paddled 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
jim 1
was 1
awful 1
disappointed 1
but 1
i 1
said 1
never 1
mind 1
cairo 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
place 1
i 1
reckoned 1
we 1
passed 1
another 1
town 1
before 1
daylight 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
high 1
ground 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
go 1
no 1
high 1
ground 1
about 1
cairo 1
jim 1
said 1
i 1
had 1
forgot 1
it 1
we 1
laid 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
on 1
a 1
towhead 1
tolerable 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
lefthand 1
bank 1
i 1
begun 1
to 1
suspicion 1
something 1
so 1
did 1
jim 1
i 1
says 1
maybe 1
we 1
went 1
by 1
cairo 1
in 1
the 1
fog 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
says 1
doan 1
les 1

huck 1
po 1
niggers 1

dont 1
you 1

yoself 1
bout 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
daylight 1
here 1
was 1
the 1
clear 1
ohio 1
water 1
inshore 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
outside 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
regular 1
muddy 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
up 1
with 1
cairo 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
do 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
we 1
couldnt 1
take 1
the 1
raft 1
up 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
dark 1
and 1
start 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
take 1
the 1
chances 1
so 1
we 1
slept 1
all 1
day 1
amongst 1
the 1
cottonwood 1
thicket 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
fresh 1
for 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
about 1
dark 1
the 1
canoe 1
was 1
gone 1
we 1
didnt 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
there 1
warnt 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
we 1
both 1
knowed 1
well 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
more 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
rattlesnakeskin 1
so 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
it 1
would 1
only 1
look 1
like 1
we 1
was 1
finding 1
fault 1
and 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
bound 1
to 1
fetch 1
more 1
bad 1
luckand 1
keep 1
on 1
fetching 1
it 1
too 1
till 1
we 1
knowed 1
enough 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
we 1
talked 1
about 1
what 1
we 1
better 1
do 1
and 1
found 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
go 1
along 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
raft 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
buy 1
a 1
canoe 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
in 1
we 1
warnt 1
going 1
to 1
borrow 1
it 1
when 1
there 1
warnt 1
anybody 1
around 1
the 1
way 1
pap 1
would 1
do 1
for 1
that 1
might 1
set 1
people 1
after 1
us 1
so 1
we 1
shoved 1
out 1
after 1
dark 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
anybody 1
that 1
dont 1
believe 1
yet 1
that 1
its 1
foolishness 1
to 1
handle 1
a 1
snakeskin 1
after 1
all 1
that 1
that 1
snakeskin 1
done 1
for 1
us 1
will 1
believe 1
it 1
now 1
if 1
they 1
read 1
on 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
more 1
it 1
done 1
for 1
us 1
the 1
place 1
to 1
buy 1
canoes 1
is 1
off 1
of 1
rafts 1
laying 1
up 1
at 1
shore 1
but 1
we 1
didnt 1
see 1
no 1
rafts 1
laying 1
up 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
during 1
three 1
hours 1
and 1
more 1
well 1
the 1
night 1
got 1
gray 1
and 1
ruther 1
thick 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
next 1
meanest 1
thing 1
to 1
fog 1
you 1
cant 1
tell 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
you 1
cant 1
see 1
no 1
distance 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
late 1
and 1
still 1
and 1
then 1
along 1
comes 1
a 1
steamboat 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
we 1
lit 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
judged 1
she 1
would 1
see 1
it 1
upstream 1
boats 1
didnt 1
generly 1
come 1
close 1
to 1
us 1
they 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
follow 1
the 1
bars 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
easy 1
water 1
under 1
the 1
reefs 1
but 1
nights 1
like 1
this 1
they 1
bull 1
right 1
up 1
the 1
channel 1
against 1
the 1
whole 1
river 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
pounding 1
along 1
but 1
we 1
didnt 1
see 1
her 1
good 1
till 1
she 1
was 1
close 1
she 1
aimed 1
right 1
for 1
us 1
often 1
they 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
close 1
they 1
can 1
come 1
without 1
touching 1
sometimes 1
the 1
wheel 1
bites 1
off 1
a 1
sweep 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
pilot 1
sticks 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
and 1
laughs 1
and 1
thinks 1
hes 1
mighty 1
smart 1
well 1
here 1
she 1
comes 1
and 1
we 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
shave 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
didnt 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
sheering 1
off 1
a 1
bit 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
one 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
coming 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
too 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
black 1
cloud 1
with 1
rows 1
of 1
glowworms 1
around 1
it 1
but 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
she 1
bulged 1
out 1
big 1
and 1
scary 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
row 1
of 1
wideopen 1
furnace 1
doors 1
shining 1
like 1
redhot 1
teeth 1
and 1
her 1
monstrous 1
bows 1
and 1
guards 1
hanging 1
right 1
over 1
us 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
yell 1
at 1
us 1
and 1
a 1
jingling 1
of 1
bells 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
engines 1
a 1
powwow 1
of 1
cussing 1
and 1
whistling 1
of 1
steamand 1
as 1
jim 1
went 1
overboard 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
i 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
she 1
come 1
smashing 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
raft 1
i 1
divedand 1
i 1
aimed 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
bottom 1
too 1
for 1
a 1
thirtyfoot 1
wheel 1
had 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
wanted 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
plenty 1
of 1
room 1
i 1
could 1
always 1
stay 1
under 1
water 1
a 1
minute 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
stayed 1
under 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
then 1
i 1
bounced 1
for 1
the 1
top 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
nearly 1
busting 1
i 1
popped 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
armpits 1
and 1
blowed 1
the 1
water 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
nose 1
and 1
puffed 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
booming 1
current 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
boat 1
started 1
her 1
engines 1
again 1
ten 1
seconds 1
after 1
she 1
stopped 1
them 1
for 1
they 1
never 1
cared 1
much 1
for 1
raftsmen 1
so 1
now 1
she 1
was 1
churning 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
weather 1
though 1
i 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
i 1
sung 1
out 1
for 1
jim 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
times 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
get 1
any 1
answer 1
so 1
i 1
grabbed 1
a 1
plank 1
that 1
touched 1
me 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
treading 1
water 1
and 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
shore 1
shoving 1
it 1
ahead 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
made 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
drift 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
towards 1
the 1
lefthand 1
shore 1
which 1
meant 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
crossing 1
so 1
i 1
changed 1
off 1
and 1
went 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
long 1
slanting 1
twomile 1
crossings 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
getting 1
over 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
safe 1
landing 1
and 1
clumb 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
but 1
i 1
went 1
poking 1
along 1
over 1
rough 1
ground 1
for 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
run 1
across 1
a 1
big 1
oldfashioned 1
double 1
loghouse 1
before 1
i 1
noticed 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rush 1
by 1
and 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
dogs 1
jumped 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
howling 1
and 1
barking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
knowed 1
better 1
than 1
to 1
move 1
another 1
peg 1

they 1
all 1

her 1
well 1
there 1

a 1
big 1
outlandish 1
parrot 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
made 1
out 1
of 1

her 1
own 1
self 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
they 1
was 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
pictures 1
i 1
ever 1
see 1
beforeblacker 1
mostly 1
than 1
is 1
common 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
slim 1
black 1
dress 1
belted 1
small 1
under 1
the 1
armpits 1
with 1
bulges 1
like 1
a 1
cabbage 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
sleeves 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
scoopshovel 1
bonnet 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
veil 1
and 1
white 1
slim 1
ankles 1
crossed 1
about 1
with 1
black 1
tape 1
and 1
very 1
wee 1
black 1
slippers 1
like 1
a 1
chisel 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
leaning 1
pensive 1
on 1
a 1
tombstone 1
on 1
her 1
right 1
elbow 1
under 1
a 1
weeping 1
willow 1
and 1
her 1
other 1
hand 1
hanging 1
down 1
her 1
side 1
holding 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
a 1
reticule 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
shall 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
thee 1
more 1
alas 1
another 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
all 1
combed 1
up 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
knotted 1
there 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
comb 1
like 1
a 1
chairback 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
crying 1
into 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
dead 1
bird 1
laying 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
in 1
her 1
other 1
hand 1
with 1
its 1
heels 1
up 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
hear 1
thy 1
sweet 1
chirrup 1
more 1
alas 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
where 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
was 1
at 1
a 1
window 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
open 1
letter 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
with 1
black 1
sealing 1
wax 1
showing 1
on 1
one 1
edge 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
mashing 1
a 1
locket 1
with 1
a 1
chain 1
to 1
it 1
against 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
and 1
art 1
thou 1
gone 1
yes 1
thou 1
art 1
gone 1
alas 1
these 1
was 1
all 1
nice 1
pictures 1
i 1
reckon 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
somehow 1
seem 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
them 1
because 1
if 1
ever 1
i 1
was 1
down 1
a 1
little 1
they 1
always 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
fantods 1
everybody 1
was 1
sorry 1
she 1
died 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
laid 1
out 1
a 1
lot 1
more 1
of 1
these 1
pictures 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
but 1
i 1
reckoned 1
that 1
with 1
her 1
disposition 1
she 1
was 1
having 1
a 1
better 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
graveyard 1
she 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
on 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
was 1
her 1
greatest 1
picture 1
when 1
she 1
took 1
sick 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
every 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
prayer 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
till 1
she 1
got 1
it 1
done 1
but 1
she 1
never 1
got 1
the 1
chance 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
gown 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
rail 1
of 1
a 1
bridge 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
jump 1
off 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
all 1
down 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
moon 1
with 1
the 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
two 1
arms 1
folded 1
across 1
her 1
breast 1
and 1
two 1
arms 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
two 1
more 1
reaching 1
up 1
towards 1
the 1
moonand 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
pair 1
would 1
look 1
best 1
and 1
then 1
scratch 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
arms 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
saying 1
she 1
died 1
before 1
she 1
got 1
her 1
mind 1
made 1
up 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
kept 1
this 1
picture 1
over 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
her 1
birthday 1
come 1
they 1
hung 1
flowers 1
on 1
it 1
other 1
times 1
it 1
was 1
hid 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
curtain 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
nice 1
sweet 1
face 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
many 1
arms 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
look 1
too 1
spidery 1

his 1
family 1

was 1
well 1
born 1
as 1
the 1
saying 1
is 1
and 1
thats 1
worth 1
as 1
much 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
horse 1
so 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1

and 1
nobody 1
ever 1
denied 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
aristocracy 1
in 1
our 1
town 1
and 1
pap 1
he 1
always 1
said 1
it 1
too 1
though 1
he 1
warnt 1
no 1
more 1
quality 1
than 1
a 1
mudcat 1
himself 1
col 1
grangerford 1
was 1
very 1
tall 1
and 1
very 1
slim 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
darkishpaly 1
complexion 1
not 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
it 1
anywheres 1
he 1
was 1
clean 1
shaved 1
every 1
morning 1
all 1
over 1
his 1
thin 1
face 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
thinnest 1
kind 1
of 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
thinnest 1
kind 1
of 1
nostrils 1
and 1
a 1
high 1
nose 1
and 1
heavy 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
the 1
blackest 1
kind 1
of 1
eyes 1
sunk 1
so 1
deep 1
back 1
that 1
they 1
seemed 1
like 1
they 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
caverns 1
at 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
his 1
forehead 1
was 1
high 1
and 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
black 1
and 1
straight 1
and 1
hung 1
to 1
his 1
shoulders 1
his 1
hands 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
thin 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
clean 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
full 1
suit 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
linen 1
so 1
white 1
it 1
hurt 1
your 1
eyes 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
on 1
sundays 1
he 1
wore 1
a 1
blue 1
tailcoat 1
with 1
brass 1
buttons 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
mahogany 1
cane 1
with 1
a 1
silver 1
head 1
to 1
it 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
frivolishness 1
about 1
him 1
not 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
he 1
warnt 1
ever 1
loud 1
he 1
was 1
as 1
kind 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
beyou 1
could 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
had 1
confidence 1
sometimes 1
he 1
smiled 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
to 1
see 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
libertypole 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
begun 1
to 1
flicker 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
climb 1
a 1
tree 1
first 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
afterwards 1
he 1
didnt 1
ever 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
anybody 1
to 1
mind 1
their 1
mannerseverybody 1

always 1
goodmannered 1
where 1
he 1

everybody 1
loved 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
around 1
too 1
he 1
was 1
sunshine 1
most 1
alwaysi 1
mean 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
seem 1
like 1
good 1
weather 1
when 1
he 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
cloudbank 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
dark 1
for 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
there 1
wouldnt 1
nothing 1
go 1
wrong 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
when 1

in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
waited 1
till 1

in 1
the 1
world 1

good 1
sermon 1

they 1
all 1
talked 1

such 1
a 1
powerful 1
lot 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
faith 1
and 1
good 1
works 1
and 1
free 1
grace 1
and 1
preforeordestination 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
roughest 1
sundays 1
i 1
had 1
run 1
across 1
yet 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
after 1
dinner 1
everybody 1
was 1
dozing 1
around 1
some 1
in 1
their 1
chairs 1
and 1
some 1
in 1
their 1
rooms 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
pretty 1
dull 1
buck 1
and 1
a 1
dog 1
was 1
stretched 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
sound 1
asleep 1
i 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
room 1
and 1
judged 1
i 1
would 1
take 1
a 1
nap 1
myself 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
sweet 1
miss 1
sophia 1
standing 1
in 1
her 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
next 1
to 1
ours 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
very 1
soft 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
liked 1
her 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
did 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
something 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
tell 1
anybody 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
would 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
shed 1
forgot 1
her 1
testament 1
and 1
left 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
seat 1
at 1
church 1
between 1
two 1
other 1
books 1
and 1
would 1
i 1
slip 1
out 1
quiet 1
and 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
nobody 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
would 1
so 1
i 1
slid 1
out 1
and 1
slipped 1
off 1
up 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
there 1
warnt 1
anybody 1
at 1
the 1
church 1
except 1
maybe 1
a 1
hog 1
or 1
two 1
for 1
there 1
warnt 1
any 1
lock 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hogs 1
likes 1
a 1
puncheon 1
floor 1
in 1
summertime 1
because 1
its 1
cool 1
if 1
you 1
notice 1
most 1
folks 1
dont 1
go 1
to 1
church 1
only 1
when 1
theyve 1
got 1
to 1
but 1
a 1
hog 1
is 1
different 1
says 1
i 1
to 1
myself 1
somethings 1
up 1
it 1
aint 1
natural 1
for 1
a 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
sweat 1
about 1
a 1
testament 1
so 1
i 1
give 1
it 1
a 1
shake 1
and 1
out 1
drops 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
with 1
halfpast 1
two 1
wrote 1
on 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
pencil 1
i 1
ransacked 1
it 1
but 1
couldnt 1
find 1
anything 1
else 1
i 1
couldnt 1
make 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
so 1
i 1
put 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
again 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
home 1
and 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
miss 1
sophia 1
in 1
her 1
door 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
she 1
pulled 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
testament 1
till 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
read 1
it 1
she 1
looked 1
glad 1
and 1
before 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
think 1
she 1
grabbed 1
me 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
squeeze 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anybody 1
she 1
was 1
mighty 1
red 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
her 1
eyes 1
lighted 1
up 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
powerful 1
pretty 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
astonished 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
breath 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
the 1
paper 1
was 1
about 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
no 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
read 1
writing 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
no 1
only 1
coarsehand 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
paper 1
warnt 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
bookmark 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
place 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
go 1
and 1
play 1
now 1
i 1
went 1
off 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
studying 1
over 1
this 1
thing 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
i 1

four 1
or 1
five 1
men 1

behind 1
the 1
woodrank 1
alongside 1
of 1
the 1
steamboat 1
landing 1

they 1
couldnt 1
come 1
it 1
every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
showed 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
woodpile 1

at 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1

squatting 1
back 1
to 1
back 1
behind 1
the 1
pile 1
so 1
they 1
could 1
watch 1
both 1
ways 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
men 1
stopped 1
cavorting 1
around 1
and 1
yelling 1
they 1
started 1
riding 1
towards 1
the 1
store 1
then 1
up 1

happenedit 1
would 1
make 1
me 1
sick 1
again 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
i 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
come 1
ashore 1
that 1
night 1
to 1
see 1
such 1
things 1
i 1
aint 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
shut 1
of 1
themlots 1
of 1
times 1
i 1
dream 1
about 1
them 1
i 1
stayed 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
till 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
dark 1
afraid 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
sometimes 1
i 1
heard 1
guns 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
twice 1
i 1
seen 1
little 1
gangs 1
of 1
men 1
gallop 1
past 1
the 1
log 1
store 1
with 1
guns 1
so 1
i 1
reckoned 1
the 1
trouble 1
was 1
still 1
agoing 1
on 1
i 1
was 1
mighty 1
downhearted 1
so 1
i 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
ever 1
go 1
anear 1
that 1
house 1
again 1
because 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
somehow 1
i 1
judged 1
that 1
that 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
meant 1
that 1
miss 1
sophia 1
was 1
to 1
meet 1
harney 1
somewheres 1
at 1
halfpast 1
two 1
and 1
run 1
off 1
and 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
about 1
that 1
paper 1
and 1
the 1
curious 1
way 1
she 1
acted 1
and 1
then 1
maybe 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
locked 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
this 1
awful 1
mess 1
wouldnt 1
ever 1
happened 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
down 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
i 1
crept 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
two 1
bodies 1
laying 1
in 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
tugged 1
at 1
them 1
till 1
i 1
got 1
them 1
ashore 1
then 1
i 1
covered 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
got 1
away 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
i 1
cried 1
a 1
little 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
covering 1
up 1
bucks 1
face 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
mighty 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
dark 1
now 1
i 1
never 1
went 1
near 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
struck 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
swamp 1
jim 1
warnt 1
on 1
his 1
island 1
so 1
i 1
tramped 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
for 1
the 1
crick 1
and 1
crowded 1
through 1
the 1
willows 1
redhot 1
to 1
jump 1
aboard 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
that 1

out 1

of 1

mississippi 1

up 1

and 1

time 1

powerful 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1

jim 1
to 1

from 1
the 1
swamp 1
we 1
said 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
home 1
like 1
a 1
raft 1
after 1
all 1
other 1
places 1
do 1
seem 1
so 1
cramped 1
up 1
and 1
smothery 1
but 1
a 1
raft 1
dont 1
you 1
feel 1
mighty 1
free 1
and 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
chapter 1
xix 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
went 1
by 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
might 1
say 1
they 1
swum 1
by 1
they 1
slid 1
along 1
so 1
quiet 1
and 1
smooth 1
and 1
lovely 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
we 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
monstrous 1
big 1
river 1
down 1
theresometimes 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
wide 1
we 1
run 1
nights 1
and 1
laid 1
up 1
and 1
hid 1
daytimes 1
soon 1
as 1
night 1
was 1
most 1
gone 1
we 1
stopped 1
navigating 1
and 1
tied 1
upnearly 1
always 1
in 1
the 1
dead 1
water 1
under 1
a 1
towhead 1
and 1
then 1
cut 1
young 1
cottonwoods 1
and 1
willows 1
and 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
with 1
them 1
then 1
we 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
lines 1
next 1
we 1
slid 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
swim 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
freshen 1
up 1
and 1
cool 1
off 1
then 1
we 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sandy 1
bottom 1
where 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
about 1
knee 1
deep 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
daylight 1
come 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
anywheresperfectly 1
stilljust 1
like 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
was 1
asleep 1
only 1
sometimes 1
the 1
bullfrogs 1
acluttering 1
maybe 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
to 1
see 1
looking 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
dull 1
linethat 1
was 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
tother 1
side 1
you 1
couldnt 1
make 1
nothing 1
else 1
out 1
then 1
a 1
pale 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
then 1
more 1
paleness 1
spreading 1
around 1
then 1
the 1
river 1
softened 1
up 1
away 1
off 1
and 1
warnt 1
black 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
gray 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
little 1
dark 1
spots 1
drifting 1
along 1
ever 1
so 1
far 1
awaytrading 1
scows 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
and 1
long 1
black 1
streaksrafts 1
sometimes 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
a 1
sweep 1
screaking 1
or 1
jumbled 1
up 1
voices 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
and 1
sounds 1
come 1
so 1
far 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
streak 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
which 1
you 1
know 1
by 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
the 1
streak 1
that 1
theres 1
a 1
snag 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
swift 1
current 1
which 1
breaks 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
makes 1
that 1
streak 1
look 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
mist 1
curl 1
up 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
east 1
reddens 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
you 1
make 1
out 1
a 1
logcabin 1
in 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
on 1
tother 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
being 1
a 1
woodyard 1
likely 1
and 1
piled 1
by 1
them 1
cheats 1
so 1
you 1
can 1
throw 1
a 1
dog 1
through 1
it 1
anywheres 1
then 1
the 1
nice 1
breeze 1
springs 1
up 1
and 1
comes 1
fanning 1
you 1
from 1
over 1
there 1
so 1
cool 1
and 1
fresh 1
and 1
sweet 1
to 1
smell 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
but 1
sometimes 1
not 1
that 1
way 1
because 1
theyve 1
left 1
dead 1
fish 1
laying 1
around 1
gars 1
and 1
such 1
and 1
they 1
do 1
get 1
pretty 1
rank 1
and 1
next 1
youve 1
got 1
the 1
full 1
day 1
and 1
everything 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
the 1
songbirds 1
just 1
going 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
smoke 1
couldnt 1
be 1
noticed 1
now 1
so 1
we 1
would 1
take 1
some 1
fish 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
cook 1
up 1
a 1
hot 1
breakfast 1
and 1
afterwards 1
we 1
would 1
watch 1
the 1
lonesomeness 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
kind 1
of 1
lazy 1
along 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
lazy 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
wake 1
up 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
look 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
maybe 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
coughing 1
along 1
upstream 1
so 1
far 1
off 1
towards 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
you 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
nothing 1
about 1
her 1
only 1
whether 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
sternwheel 1
or 1
sidewheel 1
then 1
for 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
hear 1
nor 1
nothing 1
to 1
seejust 1
solid 1
lonesomeness 1
next 1
youd 1
see 1
a 1
raft 1
sliding 1
by 1
away 1
off 1
yonder 1
and 1
maybe 1
a 1
galoot 1
on 1
it 1
chopping 1
because 1
theyre 1
most 1
always 1
doing 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
youd 1
see 1
the 1
axe 1
flash 1
and 1
come 1
downyou 1
dont 1
hear 1
nothing 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
axe 1
go 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
its 1
above 1
the 1
mans 1
head 1
then 1
you 1
hear 1
the 1
_kchunk_it 1
had 1
took 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
we 1
would 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
lazying 1
around 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
stillness 1
once 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thick 1
fog 1
and 1
the 1
rafts 1
and 1
things 1
that 1
went 1
by 1
was 1
beating 1
tin 1
pans 1
so 1
the 1
steamboats 1
wouldnt 1
run 1
over 1
them 1
a 1
scow 1
or 1
a 1
raft 1
went 1
by 1
so 1
close 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
talking 1
and 1
cussing 1
and 1
laughingheard 1
them 1
plain 1
but 1
we 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
them 1
it 1
made 1
you 1
feel 1
crawly 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
spirits 1
carrying 1
on 1
that 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
jim 1
said 1
he 1
believed 1
it 1
was 1
spirits 1
but 1
i 1
says 1
no 1
spirits 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
dern 1
the 1
dern 1
fog 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
night 1
out 1
we 1
shoved 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
her 1
out 1
to 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
we 1
let 1
her 1
alone 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
float 1
wherever 1
the 1
current 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
then 1
we 1
lit 1
the 1
pipes 1
and 1
dangled 1
our 1
legs 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
talked 1
about 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
thingswe 1
was 1
always 1
naked 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
whenever 1
the 1
mosquitoes 1
would 1
let 1
usthe 1
new 1
clothes 1
bucks 1
folks 1
made 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
comfortable 1
and 1
besides 1
i 1
didnt 1
go 1
much 1
on 1
clothes 1
nohow 1
sometimes 1
wed 1
have 1
that 1
whole 1
river 1
all 1
to 1
ourselves 1
for 1
the 1
longest 1
time 1
yonder 1
was 1
the 1
banks 1
and 1
the 1
islands 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
maybe 1
a 1
sparkwhich 1
was 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
a 1
cabin 1
window 1
and 1
sometimes 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
spark 1
or 1
twoon 1
a 1
raft 1
or 1
a 1
scow 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
maybe 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
a 1
fiddle 1
or 1
a 1
song 1
coming 1
over 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
crafts 1
its 1
lovely 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
sky 1
up 1
there 1
all 1
speckled 1
with 1
stars 1
and 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
lay 1
on 1
our 1
backs 1
and 1
look 1
up 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
discuss 1
about 1
whether 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
or 1
only 1
just 1
happened 1
jim 1
he 1
allowed 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
but 1
i 1
allowed 1
they 1
happened 1
i 1
judged 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
took 1
too 1
long 1
to 1
_make_ 1
so 1
many 1
jim 1
said 1
the 1
moon 1
could 1
a 1
_laid_ 1
them 1
well 1
that 1
looked 1
kind 1
of 1
reasonable 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
say 1
nothing 1
against 1
it 1
because 1
ive 1
seen 1
a 1
frog 1
lay 1
most 1
as 1
many 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
done 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
stars 1
that 1
fell 1
too 1
and 1
see 1
them 1
streak 1
down 1
jim 1
allowed 1
theyd 1
got 1
spoiled 1
and 1
was 1
hove 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
nest 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
we 1
would 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
slipping 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
belch 1
a 1
whole 1
world 1
of 1
sparks 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
chimbleys 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
rain 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
look 1
awful 1
pretty 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
turn 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
her 1
lights 1
would 1
wink 1
out 1
and 1
her 1
powwow 1
shut 1
off 1
and 1
leave 1
the 1
river 1
still 1
again 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
her 1
waves 1
would 1
get 1
to 1
us 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
joggle 1
the 1
raft 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
you 1
wouldnt 1
hear 1
nothing 1
for 1
you 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
how 1
long 1
except 1
maybe 1
frogs 1
or 1
something 1
after 1
midnight 1
the 1
people 1
on 1
shore 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
the 1
shores 1
was 1
blackno 1
more 1
sparks 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
windows 1
these 1
sparks 1
was 1
our 1
clockthe 1
first 1
one 1
that 1
showed 1
again 1
meant 1
morning 1
was 1
coming 1
so 1
we 1
hunted 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
hide 1
and 1
tie 1
up 1
right 1
away 1
one 1
morning 1
about 1
daybreak 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
canoe 1
and 1
crossed 1
over 1
a 1
chute 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
shoreit 1
was 1
only 1
two 1
hundred 1
yardsand 1
paddled 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
up 1
a 1
crick 1
amongst 1
the 1
cypress 1
woods 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
i 1
couldnt 1
get 1
some 1
berries 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
cowpath 1
crossed 1
the 1
crick 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
men 1
tearing 1
up 1
the 1
path 1
as 1
tight 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
foot 1
it 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
goner 1
for 1
whenever 1
anybody 1
was 1
after 1
anybody 1
i 1
judged 1
it 1

was 1
about 1
to 1

in 1
a 1
hurry 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
and 1
sung 1
out 1
and 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
save 1
their 1
livessaid 1
they 1
hadnt 1
been 1
doing 1
nothing 1
and 1

time 1
to 1
crowd 1
through 1
the 1
brush 1
and 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
crick 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
then 1

lit 1
out 1
for 1
our 1
towhead 1
and 1
in 1
about 1

heard 1
them 1
come 1
along 1
towards 1
the 1
crick 1

couldnt 1
see 1
them 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
fool 1
around 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
as 1
we 1
got 1
further 1
and 1
further 1
away 1

time 1

couldnt 1
hardly 1

by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
a 1
mile 1
of 1
woods 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
river 1

about 1
the 1

the 1
last 1
century 1

breathe 1
the 1
pure 1
air 1
of 1
freedom 1

i 1
forlorn 1
torn 1
from 1
my 1
high 1
estate 1

of 1
men 1
despised 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
ragged 1
worn 1
heartbroken 1
and 1
degraded 1
to 1
the 1
companionship 1
of 1
felons 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
jim 1
pitied 1
him 1
ever 1
so 1
much 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
i 1
we 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
warnt 1
much 1
use 1
he 1
couldnt 1
be 1
much 1
comforted 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
him 1
that 1
would 1
do 1
him 1
more 1
good 1
than 1
most 1
anything 1
else 1
so 1
we 1
said 1
we 1
would 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
us 1
how 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
bow 1
when 1
we 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
say 1
your 1
grace 1
or 1
my 1
lord 1
or 1
your 1
lordshipand 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
mind 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
called 1
him 1
plain 1
bridgewater 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
a 1
title 1
anyway 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
name 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
ought 1
to 1
wait 1
on 1
him 1
at 1
dinner 1
and 1
do 1
any 1
little 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
done 1
well 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
easy 1
so 1
we 1
done 1
it 1
all 1
through 1
dinner 1
jim 1
stood 1
around 1
and 1
waited 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
says 1

some 1
o 1
dis 1
or 1
some 1
o 1
dat 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
a 1
body 1

mighty 1
pleasing 1
to 1
him 1
but 1

old 1
man 1

pretty 1
silent 1
by 1
and 1
bydidnt 1

on 1
around 1
that 1
duke 1

seemed 1
to 1

frauds 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
kept 1
it 1
to 1
myself 1
its 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
then 1
you 1
dont 1
have 1
no 1
quarrels 1
and 1
dont 1
get 1
into 1
no 1
trouble 1
if 1
they 1
wanted 1
us 1
to 1
call 1
them 1
kings 1
and 1
dukes 1
i 1
hadnt 1
no 1
objections 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
would 1

peace 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
tell 1

if 1
i 1
never 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
else 1
out 1

that 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
kind 1
of 1
people 1
is 1
to 1
let 1

to 1
be 1
some 1
more 1
trouble 1
amongst 1

so 1
we 1
was 1
pretty 1
glad 1
when 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
tis 1
my 1
fate 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
ground 1
into 1
the 1
mire 1
under 1

it 1
we 1
got 1

as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
dark 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
stand 1
well 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
not 1
show 1
a 1
light 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
below 1
the 1
town 1
we 1
come 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
bunch 1
of 1
lights 1
by 1
and 1
bythat 1
was 1
the 1
town 1
you 1
knowand 1
slid 1
by 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
out 1
all 1
right 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
threequarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
we 1
hoisted 1
up 1
our 1
signal 1
lantern 1
and 1
about 1
ten 1
oclock 1
it 1
come 1
on 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
blow 1
and 1
thunder 1
and 1
lighten 1
like 1
everything 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
both 1
stay 1
on 1
watch 1
till 1
the 1
weather 1
got 1
better 1
then 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
turned 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
watch 1
below 1
till 1
twelve 1
but 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
a 1
turned 1
in 1
anyway 1
if 1
id 1
had 1
a 1
bed 1
because 1
a 1
body 1
dont 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
storm 1
as 1
that 1
every 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
week 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
sight 1
my 1
souls 1
how 1
the 1
wind 1
did 1
scream 1
along 1
and 1
every 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
thered 1
come 1
a 1
glare 1
that 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
whitecaps 1
for 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
around 1
and 1
youd 1
see 1
the 1
islands 1
looking 1
dusty 1
through 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
thrashing 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
then 1
comes 1
a 1
hwhackbum 1
bum 1
bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand 1
the 1
thunder 1
would 1
go 1
rumbling 1
and 1
grumbling 1
away 1
and 1
quitand 1
then 1
rip 1
comes 1
another 1
flash 1
and 1
another 1
sockdolager 1
the 1
waves 1
most 1
washed 1
me 1
off 1
the 1
raft 1
sometimes 1
but 1
i 1
hadnt 1
any 1
clothes 1
on 1
and 1
didnt 1
mind 1
we 1
didnt 1
have 1
no 1
trouble 1
about 1
snags 1
the 1
lightning 1
was 1
glaring 1
and 1
flittering 1
around 1
so 1
constant 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
plenty 1
soon 1
enough 1
to 1
throw 1
her 1
head 1
this 1
way 1
or 1
that 1
and 1
miss 1
them 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
middle 1
watch 1
you 1
know 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
pretty 1
sleepy 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
so 1
jim 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
stand 1
the 1
first 1
half 1

his 1
life 1
trying 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
pirates 1
into 1
the 1
true 1
path 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
better 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
being 1
acquainted 1
with 1
all 1
pirate 1
crews 1
in 1
that 1
ocean 1
and 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
without 1
money 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
there 1
anyway 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
convinced 1
a 1
pirate 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
to 1
him 1
dont 1
you 1
thank 1
me 1
dont 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
no 1
credit 1

dear 1
preacher 1
there 1
the 1
truest 1
friend 1
a 1
pirate 1
ever 1
had 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
busted 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
everybody 1
then 1
somebody 1
sings 1

but 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
let 1
_him_ 1
pass 1
the 1
hat 1
around 1
then 1
everybody 1
said 1
it 1
the 1
preacher 1
too 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
swabbing 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
blessing 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
praising 1
them 1
and 1
thanking 1
them 1
for 1
being 1
so 1
good 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
pirates 1
away 1
off 1
there 1
and 1
every 1

while 1
the 1
prettiest 1
kind 1
of 1
girls 1

their 1
cheeks 1

ask 1
him 1
would 1
he 1
let 1

in 1
their 1
houses 1
and 1

now 1
says 1
the 1
duke 1
after 1
tonight 1
we 1
can 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
if 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
whenever 1
we 1
see 1
anybody 1
coming 1
we 1
can 1
tie 1
jim 1
hand 1
and 1
foot 1
with 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
lay 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
show 1
this 1
handbill 1
and 1
say 1
we 1
captured 1
him 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
were 1
too 1
poor 1
to 1
travel 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
so 1
we 1
got 1
this 1
little 1
raft 1
on 1
credit 1
from 1
our 1
friends 1
and 1
are 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
reward 1
handcuffs 1
and 1
chains 1
would 1
look 1
still 1
better 1
on 1
jim 1
but 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
go 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
us 1
being 1
so 1
poor 1
too 1
much 1
like 1
jewelry 1
ropes 1
are 1
the 1
correct 1
thingwe 1
must 1
preserve 1
the 1
unities 1
as 1
we 1
say 1
on 1
the 1
boards 1
we 1
all 1
said 1
the 1

pretty 1
smart 1
and 1
there 1
couldnt 1
be 1
no 1
trouble 1
about 1
running 1
daytimes 1
we 1
judged 1

could 1
make 1

little 1
town 1
then 1
we 1

boom 1
right 1
along 1
if 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
we 1
laid 1
low 1
and 1
kept 1
still 1
and 1
never 1
shoved 1
out 1
till 1
nearly 1
ten 1
oclock 1
then 1
we 1
slid 1
by 1

from 1
the 1
town 1
and 1

he 1
made 1

and 1
put 1
his 1

on 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
after 1

by 1

just 1

up 1
and 1
down 1

minute 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
call 1
it 1
back 1
from 1
recollections 1
vaults 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
marching 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
thinking 1
and 1
frowning 1
horrible 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
hoist 1
up 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
next 1
he 1
would 1
squeeze 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
stagger 1
back 1
and 1
kind 1
of 1
moan 1
next 1
he 1
would 1
sigh 1
and 1
next 1
hed 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
drop 1
a 1
tear 1
it 1
was 1
beautiful 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
got 1
it 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
give 1
attention 1
then 1
he 1
strikes 1
a 1
most 1
noble 1
attitude 1
with 1
one 1
leg 1
shoved 1
forwards 1
and 1
his 1
arms 1
stretched 1
away 1
up 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
tilted 1
back 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
begins 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
rave 1
and 1
grit 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
all 1
through 1
his 1
speech 1
he 1
howled 1
and 1
spread 1
around 1
and 1
swelled 1
up 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
just 1
knocked 1
the 1
spots 1
out 1
of 1
any 1
acting 1
ever 1
i 1
see 1
before 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
speechi 1
learned 1
it 1
easy 1
enough 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
learning 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
be 1
or 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
bare 1
bodkin 1
that 1
makes 1
calamity 1
of 1
so 1
long 1
life 1
for 1
who 1
would 1

up 1

chance 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
had 1
some 1
show 1
bills 1
printed 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
as 1
we 1
floated 1
along 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
uncommon 1
lively 1
place 1

the 1

all 1
the 1

in 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1

we 1
tied 1
up 1
about 1
threequarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
crick 1
which 1
was 1
shut 1
in 1
like 1
a 1
tunnel 1
by 1
the 1
cypress 1

and 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
jim 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
chance 1
in 1
that 1
place 1
for 1
our 1

struck 1
it 1

on 1

the 1

in 1
_all_ 1
the 1

the 1

and 1
a 1
litter 1
of 1
pigs 1
come 1
lazying 1
along 1
the 1

and 1
look 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
salary 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
youd 1
hear 1
a 1
loafer 1
sing 1
out 1
hi 1
_so_ 1
boy 1
sick 1
him 1
tige 1
and 1
away 1
the 1
sow 1
would 1
go 1
squealing 1
most 1
horrible 1
with 1
a 1
dog 1
or 1
two 1
swinging 1
to 1
each 1
ear 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
dozen 1
more 1
acoming 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
would 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
loafers 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
watch 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
laugh 1
at 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
look 1
grateful 1
for 1
the 1
noise 1
then 1
theyd 1
settle 1
back 1
again 1
till 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dog 1
fight 1
there 1
couldnt 1
anything 1
wake 1
them 1
up 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
happy 1
all 1
over 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
fightunless 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
putting 1
turpentine 1
on 1
a 1
stray 1
dog 1
and 1
setting 1
fire 1
to 1
him 1
or 1
tying 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
to 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
run 1
himself 1
to 1
death 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
front 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
was 1
sticking 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
they 1
was 1
bowed 1
and 1
bent 1
and 1
about 1
ready 1
to 1
tumble 1
in 1
the 1
people 1
had 1
moved 1
out 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
bank 1
was 1
caved 1
away 1
under 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
some 1
others 1
and 1
that 1
corner 1
was 1
hanging 1
over 1
people 1
lived 1
in 1
them 1
yet 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dangersome 1
because 1
sometimes 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
land 1
as 1
wide 1
as 1
a 1
house 1
caves 1
in 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
sometimes 1
a 1
belt 1
of 1
land 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
deep 1
will 1
start 1
in 1
and 1
cave 1
along 1
and 1
cave 1
along 1
till 1
it 1
all 1
caves 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
in 1
one 1
summer 1
such 1
a 1
town 1
as 1
that 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
moving 1
back 1
and 1
back 1
and 1
back 1
because 1
the 1
rivers 1
always 1
gnawing 1
at 1
it 1
the 1
nearer 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
noon 1
that 1
day 1
the 1
thicker 1
and 1
thicker 1
was 1
the 1
wagons 1
and 1
horses 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
and 1
more 1
coming 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
families 1
fetched 1
their 1
dinners 1
with 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
eat 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
wagons 1
there 1
was 1
considerable 1
whisky 1
drinking 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
i 1
seen 1
three 1
fights 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
here 1
comes 1
old 1
boggsin 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
for 1
his 1
little 1
old 1
monthly 1
drunk 1
here 1
he 1
comes 1
boys 1
all 1
the 1
loafers 1
looked 1
glad 1
i 1
reckoned 1
they 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
having 1
fun 1
out 1
of 1
boggs 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
