not 1
knowing 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
save 1
first 1
before 1
his 1
attention 1
was 1
suddenly 1
caught 1
by 1
the 1
picture 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
which 1
was 1
already 1
denuded 1
of 1
everything 1
else 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
on 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
dressed 1
in 1
copious 1
fur 1
he 1
hurried 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
pressed 1
himself 1
against 1
its 1
glass 1
it 1
held 1
him 1
firmly 1
and 1
felt 1
good 1
on 1
his 1
hot 1
belly 1
this 1
picture 1
at 1
least 1
now 1
totally 1
covered 1
by 1
gregor 1
would 1
certainly 1
be 1
taken 1
away 1
by 1
noone 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
face 1
the 1
door 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
watch 1
the 1
women 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
allowed 1
themselves 1
a 1
long 1
rest 1
and 1
came 1
back 1
quite 1
soon 1
grete 1
had 1
put 1
her 1
arm 1
around 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
was 1
nearly 1
carrying 1
her 1
what 1
shall 1
we 1
take 1
now 1
then 1
said 1
grete 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
her 1
eyes 1
met 1
those 1
of 1
gregor 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
perhaps 1
only 1
because 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
there 1
she 1
remained 1
calm 1
bent 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
and 1
said 1
albeit 1
hurriedly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
tremor 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
come 1
on 1
lets 1
go 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
gregor 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
grete 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
mother 1
somewhere 1
safe 1
and 1
then 1
chase 1
him 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
well 1
she 1
could 1
certainly 1
try 1
it 1
he 1
sat 1
unyielding 1
on 1
his 1
picture 1
he 1
would 1
rather 1
jump 1
at 1
gretes 1
face 1
but 1
gretes 1
words 1
had 1
made 1
her 1
mother 1
quite 1
worried 1
she 1
stepped 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
saw 1
the 1
enormous 1
brown 1
patch 1
against 1
the 1
flowers 1
of 1
the 1
wallpaper 1
and 1
before 1
she 1
even 1
realised 1
it 1
was 1
gregor 1
that 1
she 1
saw 1
screamed 1
oh 1
god 1
oh 1
god 1
arms 1
outstretched 1
she 1
fell 1
onto 1
the 1
couch 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
everything 1
and 1
stayed 1
there 1
immobile 1
gregor 1
shouted 1
his 1
sister 1
glowering 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
shaking 1
her 1
fist 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
word 1
she 1
had 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
directly 1
since 1
his 1
transformation 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
to 1
fetch 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
smelling 1
salts 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
mother 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
faint 1
gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
help 1
too 1
he 1
could 1
save 1
his 1
picture 1
later 1
although 1
he 1
stuck 1
fast 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
pull 1
himself 1
off 1
by 1
force 1
then 1
he 1
too 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
advise 1
his 1
sister 1
like 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
just 1
stand 1
behind 1
her 1
doing 1
nothing 1
she 1
was 1
looking 1
into 1
various 1
bottles 1
he 1
startled 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
a 1
bottle 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
broke 1
a 1
splinter 1
cut 1
gregors 1
face 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
caustic 1
medicine 1
splashed 1
all 1
over 1
him 1
now 1
without 1
delaying 1
any 1
longer 1
grete 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
bottles 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
ran 1
with 1
them 1
in 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
she 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
with 1
her 1
foot 1
so 1
now 1
gregor 1
was 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
because 1
of 1
him 1
might 1
be 1
near 1
to 1
death 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
chase 1
his 1
sister 1
away 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
his 1
mother 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
wait 1
and 1
oppressed 1
with 1
anxiety 1
and 1
selfreproach 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
he 1
crawled 1
over 1
everything 1
walls 1
furniture 1
ceiling 1
and 1
finally 1
in 1
his 1
confusion 1
as 1
the 1
whole 1
room 1
began 1
to 1
spin 1
around 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
numb 1
and 1
immobile 1
all 1
around 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
quiet 1
maybe 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sign 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
someone 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
maid 1
of 1
course 1
had 1
locked 1
herself 1
in 1
her 1
kitchen 1
so 1
that 1
grete 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
answer 1
it 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
arrived 1
home 1
whats 1
happened 1
were 1
his 1
first 1
words 1
gretes 1
appearance 1
must 1
have 1
made 1
everything 1
clear 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
answered 1
him 1
with 1
subdued 1
voice 1
and 1
openly 1
pressed 1
her 1
face 1
into 1
his 1
chest 1
mothers 1
fainted 1
but 1
shes 1
better 1
now 1
gregor 1
got 1
out 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
expected 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
always 1
said 1
but 1
you 1
women 1
wouldnt 1
listen 1
would 1
you 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
gregor 1
that 1
grete 1
had 1
not 1
said 1
enough 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
mean 1
that 1
something 1
bad 1
had 1
happened 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
responsible 1
for 1
some 1
act 1
of 1
violence 1
that 1
meant 1
gregor 1
would 1
now 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
calm 1
his 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
explain 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
even 1
if 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
possible 1
so 1
he 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
pressed 1
himself 1
against 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
could 1
see 1
straight 1
away 1
that 1
gregor 1
had 1
the 1
best 1
intentions 1
and 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
without 1
delay 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
drive 1
him 1
back 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
only 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
disappear 1
his 1
father 1
though 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
mood 1
to 1
notice 1
subtleties 1
like 1
that 1
ah 1
he 1
shouted 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
sounding 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
both 1
angry 1
and 1
glad 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
gregor 1
drew 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
towards 1
his 1
father 1
he 1
really 1
had 1
not 1
imagined 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
now 1
of 1
late 1
with 1
his 1
new 1
habit 1
of 1
crawling 1
about 1
he 1
had 1
neglected 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
he 1
really 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
expected 1
things 1
to 1
have 1
changed 1
but 1
still 1
still 1
was 1
that 1
really 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
same 1
tired 1
man 1
as 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
laying 1
there 1
entombed 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
when 1
gregor 1
came 1
back 1
from 1
his 1
business 1
trips 1
who 1
would 1
receive 1
him 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
armchair 1
in 1
his 1
nightgown 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
who 1
was 1
hardly 1
even 1
able 1
to 1
stand 1
up 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
pleasure 1
would 1
just 1
raise 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
a 1
year 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
together 1
on 1
a 1
sunday 1
or 1
public 1
holiday 1
wrapped 1
up 1
tightly 1
in 1
his 1
overcoat 1
between 1
gregor 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
always 1
labour 1
his 1
way 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
slowly 1
than 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
already 1
walking 1
slowly 1
for 1
his 1
sake 1
who 1
would 1
place 1
his 1
stick 1
down 1
carefully 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
would 1
invariably 1
stop 1
and 1
gather 1
his 1
companions 1
around 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
up 1
straight 1
enough 1
now 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
smart 1
blue 1
uniform 1
with 1
gold 1
buttons 1
the 1
sort 1
worn 1
by 1
the 1
employees 1
at 1
the 1
banking 1
institute 1
above 1
the 1
high 1
stiff 1
collar 1
of 1
the 1
coat 1
his 1
strong 1
doublechin 1
emerged 1
under 1
the 1
bushy 1
eyebrows 1
his 1
piercing 1
dark 1
eyes 1
looked 1
out 1
fresh 1
and 1
alert 1
his 1
normally 1
unkempt 1
white 1
hair 1
was 1
combed 1
down 1
painfully 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
scalp 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
cap 1
with 1
its 1
gold 1
monogram 1
from 1
probably 1
some 1
bank 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
in 1
an 1
arc 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
onto 1
the 1
sofa 1
put 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
trouser 1
pockets 1
pushing 1
back 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
uniform 1
coat 1
and 1
with 1
look 1
of 1
determination 1
walked 1
towards 1
gregor 1
he 1
probably 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
know 1
himself 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
but 1
nonetheless 1
lifted 1
his 1
feet 1
unusually 1
high 1
gregor 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
enormous 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
soles 1
of 1
his 1
boots 1
but 1
wasted 1
no 1
time 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
full 1
well 1
right 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
life 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
necessary 1
to 1
always 1
be 1
extremely 1
strict 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
stopped 1
when 1
his 1
father 1
stopped 1
scurried 1
forwards 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
moved 1
even 1
slightly 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
they 1
went 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
several 1
times 1
without 1
anything 1
decisive 1
happening 1
without 1
even 1
giving 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
chase 1
as 1
everything 1
went 1
so 1
slowly 1
gregor 1
remained 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
largely 1
because 1
he 1
feared 1
his 1
father 1
might 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
especially 1
provoking 1
if 1
he 1
fled 1
onto 1
the 1
wall 1
or 1
ceiling 1
whatever 1
he 1
did 1
gregor 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
he 1
certainly 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
this 1
running 1
about 1
for 1
long 1
as 1
for 1
each 1
step 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
countless 1
movements 1
he 1
became 1
noticeably 1
short 1
of 1
breath 1
even 1
in 1
his 1
earlier 1
life 1
his 1
lungs 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
very 1
reliable 1
now 1
as 1
he 1
lurched 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
efforts 1
to 1
muster 1
all 1
the 1
strength 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
running 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
keep 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
his 1
thoughts 1
became 1
too 1
slow 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
saving 1
himself 1
than 1
running 1
he 1
almost 1
forgot 1
that 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
there 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
use 1
although 1
here 1
they 1
were 1
concealed 1
behind 1
carefully 1
carved 1
furniture 1
full 1
of 1
notches 1
and 1
protrusions 1
then 1
right 1
beside 1
him 1
lightly 1
tossed 1
something 1
flew 1
down 1
and 1
rolled 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
apple 1
then 1
another 1
one 1
immediately 1
flew 1
at 1
him 1
gregor 1
froze 1
in 1
shock 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
point 1
in 1
running 1
as 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
decided 1
to 1
bombard 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
filled 1
his 1
pockets 1
with 1
fruit 1
from 1
the 1
bowl 1
on 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
now 1
without 1
even 1
taking 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
careful 1
aim 1
threw 1
one 1
apple 1
after 1
another 1
these 1
little 1
red 1
apples 1
rolled 1
about 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
knocking 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
electric 1
motors 1
an 1
apple 1
thrown 1
without 1
much 1
force 1
glanced 1
against 1
gregors 1
back 1
and 1
slid 1
off 1
without 1
doing 1
any 1
harm 1
another 1
one 1
however 1
immediately 1
following 1
it 1
hit 1
squarely 1
and 1
lodged 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
drag 1
himself 1
away 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
remove 1
the 1
surprising 1
the 1
incredible 1
pain 1
by 1
changing 1
his 1
position 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
nailed 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
out 1
all 1
his 1
senses 1
in 1
confusion 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
he 1
saw 1
was 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
being 1
pulled 1
open 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
screaming 1
his 1
mother 1
ran 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
blouse 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
taken 1
off 1
some 1
of 1
her 1
clothes 1
after 1
she 1
had 1
fainted 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
easier 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
breathe 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
her 1
skirts 1
unfastened 1
and 1
sliding 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
stumbling 1
over 1
the 1
skirts 1
she 1
pushed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
him 1
uniting 1
herself 1
with 1
him 1
totally 1
now 1
gregor 1
lost 1
his 1
ability 1
to 1
see 1
anything 1
her 1
hands 1
behind 1
his 1
fathers 1
head 1
begging 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
gregors 1
life 1
iii 1
noone 1
dared 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
apple 1
lodged 1
in 1
gregors 1
flesh 1
so 1
it 1
remained 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
visible 1
reminder 1
of 1
his 1
injury 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
his 1
condition 1
seemed 1
serious 1
enough 1
to 1
remind 1
even 1
his 1
father 1
that 1
gregor 1
despite 1
his 1
current 1
sad 1
and 1
revolting 1
form 1
was 1
a 1
family 1
member 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
treated 1
as 1
an 1
enemy 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
as 1
a 1
family 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
duty 1
to 1
swallow 1
any 1
revulsion 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
just 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
because 1
of 1
his 1
injuries 1
gregor 1
had 1
lost 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
mobility 1
probably 1
permanently 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
an 1
ancient 1
invalid 1
and 1
it 1
took 1
him 1
long 1
long 1
minutes 1
to 1
crawl 1
across 1
his 1
room 1
crawling 1
over 1
the 1
ceiling 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
but 1
this 1
deterioration 1
in 1
his 1
condition 1
was 1
fully 1
in 1
his 1
opinion 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
being 1
left 1
open 1
every 1
evening 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
closely 1
watching 1
it 1
for 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
hours 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
then 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
seen 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
he 1
could 1
watch 1
the 1
family 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
and 1
listen 1
to 1
their 1
conversation 1
with 1
everyones 1
permission 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
and 1
thus 1
quite 1
differently 1
from 1
before 1
they 1
no 1
longer 1
held 1
the 1
lively 1
conversations 1
of 1
earlier 1
times 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
gregor 1
always 1
thought 1
about 1
with 1
longing 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
getting 1
into 1
the 1
damp 1
bed 1
in 1
some 1
small 1
hotel 1
room 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
usually 1
very 1
quiet 1
nowadays 1
soon 1
after 1
dinner 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
urge 1
each 1
other 1
to 1
be 1
quiet 1
his 1
mother 1
bent 1
deeply 1
under 1
the 1
lamp 1
would 1
sew 1
fancy 1
underwear 1
for 1
a 1
fashion 1
shop 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
sales 1
job 1
learned 1
shorthand 1
and 1
french 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
better 1
position 1
later 1
on 1
sometimes 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
wake 1
up 1
and 1
say 1
to 1
gregors 1
mother 1
youre 1
doing 1
so 1
much 1
sewing 1
again 1
today 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
dozing 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
while 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
exchange 1
a 1
tired 1
grin 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
stubbornness 1
gregors 1
father 1
refused 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
uniform 1
off 1
even 1
at 1
home 1
while 1
his 1
nightgown 1
hung 1
unused 1
on 1
its 1
peg 1
gregors 1
father 1
would 1
slumber 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
fully 1
dressed 1
as 1
if 1
always 1
ready 1
to 1
serve 1
and 1
expecting 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
his 1
superior 1
even 1
here 1
the 1
uniform 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
new 1
to 1
start 1
with 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
result 1
of 1
this 1
it 1
slowly 1
became 1
even 1
shabbier 1
despite 1
the 1
efforts 1
of 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
it 1
gregor 1
would 1
often 1
spend 1
the 1
whole 1
evening 1
looking 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
stains 1
on 1
this 1
coat 1
with 1
its 1
gold 1
buttons 1
always 1
kept 1
polished 1
and 1
shiny 1
while 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
would 1
sleep 1
highly 1
uncomfortable 1
but 1
peaceful 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
struck 1
ten 1
gregors 1
mother 1
would 1
speak 1
gently 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
wake 1
him 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
he 1
couldnt 1
sleep 1
properly 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
he 1
really 1
had 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
sleep 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
up 1
at 1
six 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
work 1
but 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
work 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
more 1
obstinate 1
and 1
would 1
always 1
insist 1
on 1
staying 1
longer 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
regularly 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
then 1
harder 1
than 1
ever 1
to 1
persuade 1
him 1
to 1
exchange 1
the 1
chair 1
for 1
his 1
bed 1
then 1
however 1
much 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
importune 1
him 1
with 1
little 1
reproaches 1
and 1
warnings 1
he 1
would 1
keep 1
slowly 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
refusing 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
gregors 1
mother 1
would 1
tug 1
at 1
his 1
sleeve 1
whisper 1
endearments 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
gregors 1
sister 1
would 1
leave 1
her 1
work 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
mother 1
but 1
nothing 1
would 1
have 1
any 1
effect 1
on 1
him 1
he 1
would 1
just 1
sink 1
deeper 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
only 1
when 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
took 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
arms 1
he 1
would 1
abruptly 1
open 1
his 1
eyes 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
say 1
what 1
a 1
life 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
peace 1
i 1
get 1
in 1
my 1
old 1
age 1
and 1
supported 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
he 1
would 1
lift 1
himself 1
up 1
carefully 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
carrying 1
the 1
greatest 1
load 1
himself 1
let 1
the 1
women 1
take 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
send 1
them 1
off 1
and 1
carry 1
on 1
by 1
himself 1
while 1
gregors 1
mother 1
would 1
throw 1
down 1
her 1
needle 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
her 1
pen 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
run 1
after 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
continue 1
being 1
of 1
help 1
to 1
him 1
who 1
in 1
this 1
tired 1
and 1
overworked 1
family 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
give 1
more 1
attention 1
to 1
gregor 1
than 1
was 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
the 1
household 1
budget 1
became 1
even 1
smaller 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
maid 1
was 1
dismissed 1
an 1
enormous 1
thickboned 1
charwoman 1
with 1
white 1
hair 1
that 1
flapped 1
around 1
her 1
head 1
came 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
evening 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
heaviest 1
work 1
everything 1
else 1
was 1
looked 1
after 1
by 1
gregors 1
mother 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
large 1
amount 1
of 1
sewing 1
work 1
she 1
did 1
gregor 1
even 1
learned 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
evening 1
conversation 1
about 1
what 1
price 1
they 1
had 1
hoped 1
for 1
that 1
several 1
items 1
of 1
jewellery 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
family 1
had 1
been 1
sold 1
even 1
though 1
both 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
wearing 1
them 1
at 1
functions 1
and 1
celebrations 1
but 1
the 1
loudest 1
complaint 1
was 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
flat 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
big 1
for 1
their 1
present 1
circumstances 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
imaginable 1
way 1
of 1
transferring 1
gregor 1
to 1
the 1
new 1
address 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
quite 1
well 1
though 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
more 1
reasons 1
than 1
consideration 1
for 1
him 1
that 1
made 1
it 1
difficult 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
move 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
quite 1
easy 1
to 1
transport 1
him 1
in 1
any 1
suitable 1
crate 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
air 1
holes 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
main 1
thing 1
holding 1
the 1
family 1
back 1
from 1
their 1
decision 1
to 1
move 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
their 1
total 1
despair 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
struck 1
with 1
a 1
misfortune 1
unlike 1
anything 1
experienced 1
by 1
anyone 1
else 1
they 1
knew 1
or 1
were 1
related 1
to 1
they 1
carried 1
out 1
absolutely 1
everything 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
expects 1
from 1
poor 1
people 1
gregors 1
father 1
brought 1
bank 1
employees 1
their 1
breakfast 1
his 1
mother 1
sacrificed 1
herself 1
by 1
washing 1
clothes 1
for 1
strangers 1
his 1
sister 1
ran 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
behind 1
her 1
desk 1
at 1
the 1
behest 1
of 1
the 1
customers 1
but 1
they 1
just 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
strength 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
the 1
injury 1
in 1
gregors 1
back 1
began 1
to 1
hurt 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
new 1
after 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
taking 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
bed 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
now 1
leave 1
their 1
work 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
sit 1
close 1
together 1
cheek 1
to 1
cheek 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
point 1
to 1
gregors 1
room 1
and 1
say 1
close 1
that 1
door 1
grete 1
and 1
then 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
again 1
they 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
and 1
their 1
tears 1
would 1
mingle 1
or 1
they 1
would 1
simply 1
sit 1
there 1
staring 1
dryeyed 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
gregor 1
hardly 1
slept 1
at 1
all 1
either 1
night 1
or 1
day 1
sometimes 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
taking 1
over 1
the 1
familys 1
affairs 1
just 1
like 1
before 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
he 1
had 1
long 1
forgotten 1
about 1
his 1
boss 1
and 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
appear 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
thoughts 1
the 1
salesmen 1
and 1
the 1
apprentices 1
that 1
stupid 1
teaboy 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
friends 1
from 1
other 1
businesses 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chambermaids 1
from 1
a 1
provincial 1
hotel 1
a 1
tender 1
memory 1
that 1
appeared 1
and 1
disappeared 1
again 1
a 1
cashier 1
from 1
a 1
hat 1
shop 1
for 1
whom 1
his 1
attention 1
had 1
been 1
serious 1
but 1
too 1
slow 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
mixed 1
together 1
with 1
strangers 1
and 1
others 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
helping 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
inaccessible 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
when 1
they 1
disappeared 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
mood 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
his 1
family 1
he 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
simple 1
rage 1
about 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
attention 1
he 1
was 1
shown 1
and 1
although 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
wanted 1
he 1
made 1
plans 1
of 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
was 1
entitled 1
to 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
hungry 1
gregors 1
sister 1
no 1
longer 1
thought 1
about 1
how 1
she 1
could 1
please 1
him 1
but 1
would 1
hurriedly 1
push 1
some 1
food 1
or 1
other 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
her 1
foot 1
before 1
she 1
rushed 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
at 1
midday 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
she 1
would 1
sweep 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
indifferent 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
eaten 1
or 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
totally 1
untouched 1
she 1
still 1
cleared 1
up 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
but 1
now 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
any 1
quicker 1
about 1
it 1
smears 1
of 1
dirt 1
were 1
left 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
little 1
balls 1
of 1
dust 1
and 1
filth 1
at 1
first 1
gregor 1
went 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
these 1
places 1
when 1
his 1
sister 1
arrived 1
as 1
a 1
reproach 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
stayed 1
there 1
for 1
weeks 1
without 1
his 1
sister 1
doing 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
dirt 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
simply 1
decided 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
to 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
became 1
touchy 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
was 1
quite 1
new 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
which 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
understood 1
cleaning 1
up 1
gregors 1
room 1
was 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
her 1
alone 1
gregors 1
mother 1
did 1
once 1
thoroughly 1
clean 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
needed 1
to 1
use 1
several 1
bucketfuls 1
of 1
water 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
although 1
that 1
much 1
dampness 1
also 1
made 1
gregor 1
ill 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
flat 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
bitter 1
and 1
immobile 1
but 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
punished 1
still 1
more 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
as 1
hardly 1
had 1
his 1
sister 1
arrived 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
than 1
she 1
noticed 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
gregors 1
room 1
and 1
highly 1
aggrieved 1
ran 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
where 1
despite 1
her 1
mothers 1
raised 1
and 1
imploring 1
hands 1
she 1
broke 1
into 1
convulsive 1
tears 1
her 1
father 1
of 1
course 1
was 1
startled 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
parents 1
looked 1
on 1
astonished 1
and 1
helpless 1
then 1
they 1
too 1
became 1
agitated 1
gregors 1
father 1
standing 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
accused 1
her 1
of 1
not 1
leaving 1
the 1
cleaning 1
of 1
gregors 1
room 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
from 1
her 1
left 1
gregors 1
sister 1
screamed 1
at 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
clean 1
gregors 1
room 1
again 1
while 1
his 1
mother 1
tried 1
to 1
draw 1
his 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
beside 1
himself 1
with 1
anger 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
his 1
sister 1
quaking 1
with 1
tears 1
thumped 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
her 1
small 1
fists 1
and 1
gregor 1
hissed 1
in 1
anger 1
that 1
noone 1
had 1
even 1
thought 1
of 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
noise 1
gregors 1
sister 1
was 1
exhausted 1
from 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
looking 1
after 1
gregor 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
work 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
even 1
so 1
his 1
mother 1
ought 1
certainly 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
her 1
place 1
gregor 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
neglected 1
now 1
though 1
the 1
charwoman 1
was 1
here 1
this 1
elderly 1
widow 1
with 1
a 1
robust 1
bone 1
structure 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
able 1
to 1
withstand 1
the 1
hardest 1
of 1
things 1
in 1
her 1
long 1
life 1
wasnt 1
really 1
repelled 1
by 1
gregor 1
just 1
by 1
chance 1
one 1
day 1
rather 1
than 1
any 1
real 1
curiosity 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
gregors 1
room 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
totally 1
by 1
surprise 1
noone 1
was 1
chasing 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
rush 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
while 1
she 1
just 1
stood 1
there 1
in 1
amazement 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
crossed 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
she 1
never 1
failed 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
slightly 1
every 1
evening 1
and 1
morning 1
and 1
look 1
briefly 1
in 1
on 1
him 1
at 1
first 1
she 1
would 1
call 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
with 1
words 1
that 1
she 1
probably 1
considered 1
friendly 1
such 1
as 1
come 1
on 1
then 1
you 1
old 1
dungbeetle 1
or 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
dungbeetle 1
there 1
gregor 1
never 1
responded 1
to 1
being 1
spoken 1
to 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
remained 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
without 1
moving 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
never 1
even 1
been 1
opened 1
if 1
only 1
they 1
had 1
told 1
this 1
charwoman 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
his 1
room 1
every 1
day 1
instead 1
of 1
letting 1
her 1
disturb 1
him 1
for 1
no 1
reason 1
whenever 1
she 1
felt 1
like 1
it 1
one 1
day 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
while 1
a 1
heavy 1
rain 1
struck 1
the 1
windowpanes 1
perhaps 1
indicating 1
that 1
spring 1
was 1
coming 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
once 1
again 1
gregor 1
was 1
so 1
resentful 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
move 1
toward 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
slow 1
and 1
infirm 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
attack 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
afraid 1
the 1
charwoman 1
just 1
lifted 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chairs 1
from 1
near 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
with 1
her 1
mouth 1
open 1
clearly 1
intending 1
not 1
to 1
close 1
her 1
mouth 1
until 1
the 1
chair 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
had 1
been 1
slammed 1
down 1
into 1
gregors 1
back 1
arent 1
you 1
coming 1
any 1
closer 1
then 1
she 1
asked 1
when 1
gregor 1
turned 1
round 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
calmly 1
put 1
the 1
chair 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
gregor 1
had 1
almost 1
entirely 1
stopped 1
eating 1
only 1
if 1
he 1
happened 1
to 1
find 1
himself 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
food 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
it 1
leave 1
it 1
there 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
and 1
then 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
spit 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
distress 1
at 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
that 1
stopped 1
him 1
eating 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
soon 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
changes 1
made 1
there 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
putting 1
things 1
into 1
this 1
room 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
anywhere 1
else 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
now 1
many 1
such 1
things 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rooms 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
had 1
been 1
rented 1
out 1
to 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
these 1
earnest 1
gentlemen 1
all 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
full 1
beards 1
as 1
gregor 1
learned 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
one 1
day 1
were 1
painfully 1
insistent 1
on 1
things 1
being 1
tidy 1
this 1
meant 1
not 1
only 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
room 1
but 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
room 1
in 1
this 1
establishment 1
in 1
the 1
entire 1
flat 1
and 1
especially 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
unnecessary 1
clutter 1
was 1
something 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
tolerate 1
especially 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
dirty 1
they 1
had 1
moreover 1
brought 1
most 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
furnishings 1
and 1
equipment 1
with 1
them 1
for 1
this 1
reason 1
many 1
things 1
had 1
become 1
superfluous 1
which 1
although 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
sold 1
the 1
family 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
discard 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
found 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
gregors 1
room 1
the 1
dustbins 1
from 1
the 1
kitchen 1
found 1
their 1
way 1
in 1
there 1
too 1
the 1
charwoman 1
was 1
always 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
anything 1
she 1
couldnt 1
use 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
she 1
would 1
just 1
chuck 1
in 1
there 1
he 1
fortunately 1
would 1
usually 1
see 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
object 1
and 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
held 1
it 1
the 1
woman 1
most 1
likely 1
meant 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
things 1
back 1
out 1
again 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
opportunity 1
or 1
to 1
throw 1
everything 1
out 1
in 1
one 1
go 1
but 1
what 1
actually 1
happened 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
left 1
where 1
they 1
landed 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
first 1
been 1
thrown 1
unless 1
gregor 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
junk 1
and 1
moved 1
it 1
somewhere 1
else 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
moved 1
it 1
because 1
with 1
no 1
other 1
room 1
free 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
crawl 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
but 1
later 1
on 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
enjoy 1
it 1
although 1
moving 1
about 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
left 1
him 1
sad 1
and 1
tired 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
remain 1
immobile 1
for 1
hours 1
afterwards 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
rented 1
the 1
room 1
would 1
sometimes 1
take 1
their 1
evening 1
meal 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
that 1
was 1
used 1
by 1
everyone 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
this 1
room 1
was 1
often 1
kept 1
closed 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
but 1
gregor 1
found 1
it 1
easy 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
having 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
he 1
had 1
after 1
all 1
often 1
failed 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
without 1
the 1
family 1
having 1
noticed 1
it 1
lain 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
in 1
its 1
darkest 1
corner 1
one 1
time 1
though 1
the 1
charwoman 1
left 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
slightly 1
open 1
and 1
it 1
remained 1
open 1
when 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
rented 1
the 1
room 1
came 1
in 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
put 1
on 1
they 1
sat 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
where 1
formerly 1
gregor 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
meals 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
they 1
unfolded 1
the 1
serviettes 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
their 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
gregors 1
mother 1
immediately 1
appeared 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
meat 1
and 1
soon 1
behind 1
her 1
came 1
his 1
sister 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
piled 1
high 1
with 1
potatoes 1
the 1
food 1
was 1
steaming 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
its 1
smell 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
dishes 1
set 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
test 1
the 1
food 1
before 1
eating 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
count 1
as 1
an 1
authority 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
did 1
indeed 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
while 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
its 1
dish 1
clearly 1
wishing 1
to 1
establish 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
sufficiently 1
cooked 1
or 1
whether 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
sent 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
his 1
satisfaction 1
and 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
on 1
anxiously 1
began 1
to 1
breathe 1
again 1
and 1
smiled 1
the 1
family 1
themselves 1
ate 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
nonetheless 1
gregors 1
father 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
bowed 1
once 1
with 1
his 1
cap 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
did 1
his 1
round 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
stood 1
as 1
one 1
and 1
mumbled 1
something 1
into 1
their 1
beards 1
then 1
once 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
they 1
ate 1
in 1
near 1
perfect 1
silence 1
it 1
seemed 1
remarkable 1
to 1
gregor 1
that 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
various 1
noises 1
of 1
eating 1
their 1
chewing 1
teeth 1
could 1
still 1
be 1
heard 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
show 1
gregor 1
that 1
you 1
need 1
teeth 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
possible 1
to 1
perform 1
anything 1
with 1
jaws 1
that 1
are 1
toothless 1
however 1
nice 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
id 1
like 1
to 1
eat 1
something 1
said 1
gregor 1
anxiously 1
but 1
not 1
anything 1
like 1
theyre 1
eating 1
they 1
do 1
feed 1
themselves 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
dying 1
throughout 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
gregor 1
could 1
not 1
remember 1
having 1
heard 1
the 1
violin 1
being 1
played 1
but 1
this 1
evening 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
from 1
the 1
kitchen 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
already 1
finished 1
their 1
meal 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
had 1
produced 1
a 1
newspaper 1
given 1
a 1
page 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
leant 1
back 1
in 1
their 1
chairs 1
reading 1
them 1
and 1
smoking 1
when 1
the 1
violin 1
began 1
playing 1
they 1
became 1
attentive 1
stood 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
hallway 1
where 1
they 1
stood 1
pressed 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
someone 1
must 1
have 1
heard 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
as 1
gregors 1
father 1
called 1
out 1
is 1
the 1
playing 1
perhaps 1
unpleasant 1
for 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
we 1
can 1
stop 1
it 1
straight 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
would 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
play 1
for 1
us 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
all 1
much 1
more 1
cosy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
oh 1
yes 1
wed 1
love 1
to 1
called 1
back 1
gregors 1
father 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
violin 1
player 1
himself 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
stepped 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
waited 1
gregors 1
father 1
soon 1
appeared 1
with 1
the 1
music 1
stand 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
music 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
with 1
the 1
violin 1
she 1
calmly 1
prepared 1
everything 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
begin 1
playing 1
his 1
parents 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
rented 1
a 1
room 1
out 1
before 1
and 1
therefore 1
showed 1
an 1
exaggerated 1
courtesy 1
towards 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
dare 1
to 1
sit 1
on 1
their 1
own 1
chairs 1
his 1
father 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
pushed 1
in 1
between 1
two 1
buttons 1
on 1
his 1
uniform 1
coat 1
his 1
mother 1
though 1
was 1
offered 1
a 1
seat 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
and 1
sat 1
leaving 1
the 1
chair 1
where 1
the 1
gentleman 1
happened 1
to 1
have 1
placed 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
his 1
sister 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
paid 1
close 1
attention 1
one 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
her 1
hands 1
drawn 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
playing 1
gregor 1
had 1
dared 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
already 1
had 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
great 1
pride 1
in 1
how 1
considerate 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
hardly 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
so 1
thoughtless 1
about 1
the 1
others 1
whats 1
more 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
reason 1
to 1
keep 1
himself 1
hidden 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
covered 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
that 1
lay 1
everywhere 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
flew 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
slightest 1
movement 1
he 1
carried 1
threads 1
hairs 1
and 1
remains 1
of 1
food 1
about 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
sides 1
he 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
indifferent 1
to 1
everything 1
now 1
to 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
wipe 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
carpet 1
like 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
several 1
times 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
despite 1
this 1
condition 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
too 1
shy 1
to 1
move 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
onto 1
the 1
immaculate 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
noone 1
noticed 1
him 1
though 1
the 1
family 1
was 1
totally 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
the 1
violin 1
playing 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
put 1
their 1
hands 1
in 1
their 1
pockets 1
and 1
come 1
up 1
far 1
too 1
close 1
behind 1
the 1
music 1
stand 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
notes 1
being 1
played 1
and 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
disturbed 1
gregors 1
sister 1
but 1
soon 1
in 1
contrast 1
with 1
the 1
family 1
they 1
withdrew 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
sunk 1
and 1
talking 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
at 1
half 1
volume 1
and 1
they 1
stayed 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
while 1
gregors 1
father 1
observed 1
them 1
anxiously 1
it 1
really 1
now 1
seemed 1
very 1
obvious 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
expected 1
to 1
hear 1
some 1
beautiful 1
or 1
entertaining 1
violin 1
playing 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
disappointed 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
performance 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
now 1
out 1
of 1
politeness 1
that 1
they 1
allowed 1
their 1
peace 1
to 1
be 1
disturbed 1
it 1
was 1
especially 1
unnerving 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
all 1
blew 1
the 1
smoke 1
from 1
their 1
cigarettes 1
upwards 1
from 1
their 1
mouth 1
and 1
noses 1
yet 1
gregors 1
sister 1
was 1
playing 1
so 1
beautifully 1
her 1
face 1
was 1
leant 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
following 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
music 1
with 1
a 1
careful 1
and 1
melancholy 1
expression 1
gregor 1
crawled 1
a 1
little 1
further 1
forward 1
keeping 1
his 1
head 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
meet 1
her 1
eyes 1
if 1
the 1
chance 1
came 1
was 1
he 1
an 1
animal 1
if 1
music 1
could 1
captivate 1
him 1
so 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
shown 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
unknown 1
nourishment 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
yearning 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
forward 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
tug 1
at 1
her 1
skirt 1
to 1
show 1
her 1
she 1
might 1
come 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
her 1
violin 1
as 1
noone 1
appreciated 1
her 1
playing 1
here 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
he 1
never 1
wanted 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
not 1
while 1
he 1
lived 1
anyway 1
his 1
shocking 1
appearance 1
should 1
for 1
once 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
every 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
hiss 1
and 1
spit 1
at 1
the 1
attackers 1
his 1
sister 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
him 1
though 1
but 1
stay 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
she 1
would 1
sit 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
with 1
her 1
ear 1
bent 1
down 1
to 1
him 1
while 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
intended 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
everyone 1
about 1
it 1
last 1
christmas 1
had 1
christmas 1
really 1
come 1
and 1
gone 1
already 1
if 1
this 1
misfortune 1
hadnt 1
got 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
refuse 1
to 1
let 1
anyone 1
dissuade 1
him 1
from 1
it 1
on 1
hearing 1
all 1
this 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
break 1
out 1
in 1
tears 1
of 1
emotion 1
and 1
gregor 1
would 1
climb 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
shoulder 1
and 1
kiss 1
her 1
neck 1
which 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
she 1
had 1
kept 1
free 1
without 1
any 1
necklace 1
or 1
collar 1
mr 1
samsa 1
shouted 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
to 1
gregors 1
father 1
pointing 1
without 1
wasting 1
any 1
more 1
words 1
with 1
his 1
forefinger 1
at 1
gregor 1
as 1
he 1
slowly 1
moved 1
forward 1
the 1
violin 1
went 1
silent 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
first 1
smiled 1
at 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
back 1
at 1
gregor 1
his 1
father 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
more 1
important 1
to 1
calm 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
before 1
driving 1
gregor 1
out 1
even 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
upset 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
gregor 1
was 1
more 1
entertaining 1
than 1
the 1
violin 1
playing 1
had 1
been 1
he 1
rushed 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
spread 1
out 1
and 1
attempted 1
to 1
drive 1
them 1
back 1
into 1
their 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
trying 1
to 1
block 1
their 1
view 1
of 1
gregor 1
with 1
his 1
body 1
now 1
they 1
did 1
become 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
clear 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
fathers 1
behaviour 1
that 1
annoyed 1
them 1
or 1
the 1
dawning 1
realisation 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
a 1
neighbour 1
like 1
gregor 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
they 1
asked 1
gregors 1
father 1
for 1
explanations 1
raised 1
their 1
arms 1
like 1
he 1
had 1
tugged 1
excitedly 1
at 1
their 1
beards 1
and 1
moved 1
back 1
towards 1
their 1
room 1
only 1
very 1
slowly 1
meanwhile 1
gregors 1
sister 1
had 1
overcome 1
the 1
despair 1
she 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
when 1
her 1
playing 1
was 1
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
she 1
had 1
let 1
her 1
hands 1
drop 1
and 1
let 1
violin 1
and 1
bow 1
hang 1
limply 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
continued 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
music 1
as 1
if 1
still 1
playing 1
but 1
then 1
she 1
suddenly 1
pulled 1
herself 1
together 1
lay 1
the 1
instrument 1
on 1
her 1
mothers 1
lap 1
who 1
still 1
sat 1
laboriously 1
struggling 1
for 1
breath 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
which 1
under 1
pressure 1
from 1
her 1
father 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
were 1
more 1
quickly 1
moving 1
toward 1
under 1
his 1
sisters 1
experienced 1
hand 1
the 1
pillows 1
and 1
covers 1
on 1
the 1
beds 1
flew 1
up 1
and 1
were 1
put 1
into 1
order 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
already 1
finished 1
making 1
the 1
beds 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
again 1
before 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
room 1
gregors 1
father 1
seemed 1
so 1
obsessed 1
with 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
all 1
the 1
respect 1
he 1
owed 1
to 1
his 1
tenants 1
he 1
urged 1
them 1
and 1
pressed 1
them 1
until 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
already 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
shouted 1
like 1
thunder 1
and 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
thereby 1
brought 1
gregors 1
father 1
to 1
a 1
halt 1
i 1
declare 1
here 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
said 1
raising 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
glancing 1
at 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
to 1
gain 1
their 1
attention 1
too 1
that 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
the 1
repugnant 1
conditions 1
that 1
prevail 1
in 1
this 1
flat 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
family 1
here 1
he 1
looked 1
briefly 1
but 1
decisively 1
at 1
the 1
floor 1
i 1
give 1
immediate 1
notice 1
on 1
my 1
room 1
for 1
the 1
days 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
living 1
here 1
i 1
will 1
of 1
course 1
pay 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
i 1
will 1
consider 1
whether 1
to 1
proceed 1
with 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
action 1
for 1
damages 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
believe 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
easy 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
grounds 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
action 1
he 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
looked 1
straight 1
ahead 1
as 1
if 1
waiting 1
for 1
something 1
and 1
indeed 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
words 1
and 1
we 1
also 1
give 1
immediate 1
notice 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
handle 1
and 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
gregors 1
father 1
staggered 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
feeling 1
his 1
way 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
it 1
it 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
stretching 1
himself 1
out 1
for 1
his 1
usual 1
evening 1
nap 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
uncontrolled 1
way 1
his 1
head 1
kept 1
nodding 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
sleeping 1
at 1
all 1
throughout 1
all 1
this 1
gregor 1
had 1
lain 1
still 1
where 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
first 1
seen 1
him 1
his 1
disappointment 1
at 1
the 1
failure 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
and 1
perhaps 1
also 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
weak 1
from 1
hunger 1
made 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
move 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
everyone 1
would 1
turn 1
on 1
him 1
any 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
waited 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
startled 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
state 1
when 1
the 1
violin 1
on 1
his 1
mothers 1
lap 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
trembling 1
fingers 1
and 1
landed 1
loudly 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
father 1
mother 1
said 1
his 1
sister 1
hitting 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
her 1
hand 1
as 1
introduction 1
we 1
cant 1
carry 1
on 1
like 1
this 1
maybe 1
you 1
cant 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
call 1
this 1
monster 1
my 1
brother 1
all 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
is 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
weve 1
done 1
all 1
thats 1
humanly 1
possible 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
be 1
patient 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
anyone 1
could 1
accuse 1
us 1
of 1
doing 1
anything 1
wrong 1
shes 1
absolutely 1
right 1
said 1
gregors 1
father 1
to 1
himself 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
still 1
had 1
not 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
catch 1
her 1
breath 1
began 1
to 1
cough 1
dully 1
her 1
hand 1
held 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
a 1
deranged 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
gregors 1
sister 1
rushed 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
her 1
forehead 1
her 1
words 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
gregors 1
father 1
some 1
more 1
definite 1
ideas 1
he 1
sat 1
upright 1
played 1
with 1
his 1
uniform 1
cap 1
between 1
the 1
plates 1
left 1
by 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
after 1
their 1
meal 1
and 1
occasionally 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
gregor 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
immobile 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
gregors 1
sister 1
now 1
speaking 1
only 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
as 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
too 1
occupied 1
with 1
coughing 1
to 1
listen 1
itll 1
be 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
both 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
it 1
coming 1
we 1
cant 1
all 1
work 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
and 1
then 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
be 1
tortured 1
like 1
this 1
we 1
cant 1
endure 1
it 1
i 1
cant 1
endure 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
she 1
broke 1
out 1
so 1
heavily 1
in 1
tears 1
that 1
they 1
flowed 1
down 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
she 1
wiped 1
them 1
away 1
with 1
mechanical 1
hand 1
movements 1
my 1
child 1
said 1
her 1
father 1
with 1
sympathy 1
and 1
obvious 1
understanding 1
what 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
his 1
sister 1
just 1
shrugged 1
her 1
shoulders 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
helplessness 1
and 1
tears 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
hold 1
of 1
her 1
displacing 1
her 1
earlier 1
certainty 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
just 1
understand 1
us 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
almost 1
as 1
a 1
question 1
his 1
sister 1
shook 1
her 1
hand 1
vigorously 1
through 1
her 1
tears 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
of 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
