you 1

read 1
a 1
book 1
by 1
the 1
name 1

the 1

of 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
but 1
that 1
aint 1
no 1
matter 1
that 1
book 1
was 1
made 1
by 1
mr 1
mark 1
twain 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
mainly 1
there 1
was 1
things 1
which 1
he 1
stretched 1
but 1
mainly 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
is 1
nothing 1
i 1
never 1
seen 1
anybody 1
but 1
lied 1
one 1
time 1

another 1

the 1

is 1
all 1
told 1
about 1
in 1
that 1
book 1
which 1
is 1
mostly 1
a 1
true 1
book 1
with 1
some 1
stretchers 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
before 1
now 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
the 1
book 1
winds 1
up 1
is 1
this 1
tom 1
and 1
me 1
found 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
the 1
robbers 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
us 1
rich 1
we 1
got 1
six 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
apieceall 1
gold 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
awful 1
sight 1
of 1
money 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
piled 1
up 1
well 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
at 1
interest 1
and 1
it 1
fetched 1
us 1
a 1
dollar 1
a 1
day 1
apiece 1
all 1
the 1
year 1
roundmore 1
than 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
tell 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
for 1
her 1
son 1
and 1
allowed 1
she 1
would 1
sivilize 1
me 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
rough 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
considering 1
how 1
dismal 1
regular 1
and 1
decent 1
the 1
widow 1
was 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
ways 1
and 1
so 1
when 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
i 1
lit 1
out 1
i 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
old 1
rags 1
and 1
my 1
sugarhogshead 1
again 1
and 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
satisfied 1
but 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
he 1
hunted 1
me 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
robbers 1
and 1
i 1

ease 1
up 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stood 1
it 1
much 1
longer 1
then 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
it 1

deadly 1
dull 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
fidgety 1
miss 1
watson 1

huckleberrywhy 1
dont 1
you 1

then 1
she 1
told 1
me 1

about 1
the 1
bad 1
place 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
wished 1
i 1

there 1
she 1
got 1
mad 1
then 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
mean 1
no 1
harm 1
all 1
i 1
wanted 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
somewheres 1
all 1
i 1
wanted 1
was 1
a 1
change 1
i 1
warnt 1
particular 1
she 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
wicked 1
to 1
say 1
what 1
i 1
said 1
said 1
she 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
live 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
good 1
place 1
well 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
advantage 1
in 1
going 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
so 1
i 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
try 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
so 1
because 1
it 1
would 1
only 1
make 1
trouble 1
and 1
wouldnt 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
now 1
she 1
had 1
got 1
a 1
start 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
good 1
place 1
she 1
said 1
all 1
a 1
body 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
around 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
with 1
a 1
harp 1
and 1
sing 1
forever 1
and 1
ever 1
so 1
i 1
didnt 1
think 1
much 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
so 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
reckoned 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
would 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
considerable 1
sight 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
about 1
that 1
because 1
i 1
wanted 1
him 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
together 1
miss 1
watson 1
she 1
kept 1
pecking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
tiresome 1
and 1
lonesome 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
fetched 1
the 1
niggers 1
in 1
and 1
had 1
prayers 1
and 1
then 1
everybody 1
was 1
off 1
to 1
bed 1
i 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
candle 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
then 1
i 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
cheerful 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
i 1
felt 1
so 1
lonesome 1
i 1
most 1
wished 1
i 1
was 1
dead 1
the 1
stars 1
were 1
shining 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
rustled 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
ever 1
so 1
mournful 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
an 1
owl 1
away 1
off 1
whowhooing 1
about 1
somebody 1
that 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
a 1
whippowill 1
and 1
a 1
dog 1
crying 1
about 1
somebody 1
that 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
whisper 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
cold 1
shivers 1
run 1
over 1
me 1
then 1
away 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
heard 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
sound 1
that 1
a 1
ghost 1
makes 1
when 1
it 1
wants 1
to 1
tell 1
about 1
something 1
thats 1
on 1
its 1
mind 1
and 1
cant 1
make 1
itself 1
understood 1
and 1
so 1
cant 1
rest 1
easy 1
in 1
its 1
grave 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
that 1
way 1
every 1
night 1
grieving 1
i 1
got 1
so 1
downhearted 1
and 1
scared 1
i 1
did 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
some 1
company 1
pretty 1
soon 1
a 1
spider 1
went 1
crawling 1
up 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
i 1
flipped 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
lit 1
in 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
budge 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
shriveled 1
up 1
i 1
didnt 1
need 1
anybody 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
an 1
awful 1
bad 1
sign 1
and 1
would 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
bad 1
luck 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
scared 1
and 1
most 1
shook 1
the 1
clothes 1
off 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
turned 1
around 1
in 1
my 1
tracks 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
crossed 1
my 1
breast 1
every 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
tied 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
lock 1
of 1
my 1
hair 1
with 1
a 1
thread 1
to 1
keep 1
witches 1
away 1
but 1

hadnt 1
no 1
confidence 1

do 1
that 1
when 1
youve 1
lost 1
a 1
horseshoe 1
that 1
youve 1
found 1
instead 1
of 1
nailing 1
it 1
up 1
over 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
i 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
heard 1
anybody 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
any 1
way 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1

and 1
knees 1
and 1
play 1
something 1
on 1

it 1
seemed 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
everything 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
and 1
lonesome 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1

right 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
jim 1
stirred 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
he 1
didnt 1
wake 1
afterwards 1
jim 1
said 1
the 1
witches 1
be 1
witched 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
and 1
rode 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
state 1
and 1
then 1
set 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
trees 1
again 1
and 1
hung 1
his 1
hat 1
on 1
a 1
limb 1
to 1
show 1

it 1
and 1
next 1
time 1
jim 1
told 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
rode 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
new 1
orleans 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
told 1
it 1
he 1
spread 1
it 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
rode 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
tired 1
him 1
most 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
his 1
back 1
was 1
all 1
over 1
saddleboils 1
jim 1
was 1
monstrous 1
proud 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
so 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
hardly 1
notice 1
the 1
other 1
niggers 1
niggers 1
would 1
come 1
miles 1
to 1
hear 1
jim 1
tell 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
more 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
than 1
any 1
nigger 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
strange 1
niggers 1
would 1
stand 1
with 1
their 1
mouths 1
open 1
and 1
look 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
same 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
wonder 1
niggers 1
is 1
always 1
talking 1
about 1
witches 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
fire 1
but 1
whenever 1
one 1
was 1
talking 1
and 1
letting 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
such 1
things 1
jim 1
would 1
happen 1
in 1
and 1
say 1
hm 1
what 1
you 1
know 1
bout 1
witches 1
and 1
that 1
nigger 1
was 1
corked 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
back 1
seat 1
jim 1
always 1
kept 1
that 1
fivecenter 1
piece 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
string 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
charm 1
the 1
devil 1
give 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
cure 1
anybody 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
fetch 1
witches 1
whenever 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
just 1
by 1
saying 1
something 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
told 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
it 1
niggers 1
would 1
come 1
from 1
all 1
around 1
there 1
and 1
give 1
jim 1
anything 1
they 1
had 1
just 1
for 1
a 1
sight 1
of 1
that 1
fivecenter 1
piece 1
but 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
touch 1
it 1
because 1
the 1
devil 1
had 1
had 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
it 1
jim 1
was 1
most 1
ruined 1
for 1
a 1
servant 1
because 1
he 1
got 1
stuck 1
up 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
having 1
seen 1
the 1
devil 1
and 1
been 1
rode 1
by 1
witches 1
well 1
when 1
tom 1
and 1
me 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
hilltop 1
we 1
looked 1
away 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
could 1
see 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
lights 1
twinkling 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
sick 1
folks 1
maybe 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
over 1
us 1
was 1
sparkling 1
ever 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
whole 1
mile 1
broad 1
and 1
awful 1
still 1
and 1
grand 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
found 1
jo 1
harper 1
and 1
ben 1
rogers 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
tanyard 1
so 1
we 1
unhitched 1
a 1
skiff 1
and 1
pulled 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
two 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
to 1
the 1
big 1
scar 1
on 1
the 1
hillside 1
and 1
went 1
ashore 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
bushes 1
and 1
tom 1
made 1
everybody 1
swear 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
secret 1
and 1
then 1
showed 1
them 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
hill 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
thickest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
bushes 1
then 1
we 1
lit 1
the 1
candles 1
and 1
crawled 1
in 1
on 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
we 1
went 1
about 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
cave 1
opened 1
up 1
tom 1
poked 1
about 1
amongst 1
the 1
passages 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
ducked 1
under 1
a 1
wall 1
where 1
you 1
wouldnt 1
a 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
hole 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
a 1
narrow 1
place 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
room 1
all 1
damp 1
and 1
sweaty 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
stopped 1
tom 1
says 1

tom 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wrote 1
the 1
oath 1

a 1
cross 1
in 1
their 1
breasts 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
band 1
and 1
nobody 1

use 1
that 1
mark 1
and 1
if 1

be 1
sued 1
and 1
if 1
he 1

and 1
if 1
anybody 1
that 1

to 1
the 1

told 1
the 1
secrets 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
his 1
throat 1
cut 1
and 1
then 1
have 1
his 1
carcass 1
burnt 1
up 1
and 1
the 1

some 1
authorities 1
think 1
different 1
but 1
mostly 1
its 1
considered 1
best 1
to 1
kill 1
themexcept 1
some 1
that 1

the 1
cave 1
here 1
and 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
theyre 1
ransomed 1
ransomed 1
whats 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1

but 1
thats 1
what 1
they 1
do 1
ive 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
books 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
thats 1
what 1
weve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
how 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
why 1
blame 1
it 1
all 1
weve 1
_got_ 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
dont 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
its 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
doing 1
different 1
from 1
whats 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
and 1
get 1
things 1
all 1
muddled 1
up 1
oh 1
thats 1
all 1
very 1
fine 1
to 1
_say_ 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
but 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
nation 1
are 1
these 1
fellows 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
ransomed 1
if 1
we 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
to 1
themthats 1
the 1
thing 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
now 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
but 1
peraps 1
if 1
we 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
theyre 1
ransomed 1
it 1
means 1
that 1
we 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
theyre 1
dead 1
now 1
thats 1
something 1
_like_ 1
thatll 1
answer 1
why 1
couldnt 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
before 1
well 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
theyre 1
ransomed 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
a 1
bothersome 1
lot 1
theyll 1
be 1
tooeating 1
up 1
everything 1
and 1
always 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
loose 1
how 1
you 1
talk 1
ben 1
rogers 1
how 1
can 1
they 1
get 1
loose 1
when 1
theres 1
a 1
guard 1
over 1
them 1
ready 1
to 1
shoot 1
them 1
down 1
if 1
they 1
move 1
a 1
peg 1
a 1
guard 1
well 1
that 1
_is_ 1
good 1
so 1
somebodys 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
up 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
never 1
get 1
any 1
sleep 1
just 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
watch 1
them 1
i 1
think 1
thats 1
foolishness 1
why 1
cant 1
a 1
body 1
take 1
a 1
club 1
and 1
ransom 1
them 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
get 1
here 1
because 1
it 1
aint 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
sothats 1
why 1
now 1
ben 1
rogers 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
things 1
regular 1
or 1
dont 1
youthats 1
the 1
idea 1
dont 1
you 1
reckon 1
that 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
books 1
knows 1
whats 1
the 1
correct 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
_you_ 1
can 1
learn 1
em 1
anything 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
no 1
sir 1
well 1
just 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
ransom 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
regular 1
way 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
dont 1
mind 1
but 1
i 1
say 1
its 1
a 1
fool 1
way 1
anyhow 1
say 1
do 1
we 1
kill 1
the 1
women 1
too 1
well 1
ben 1
rogers 1

women 1

called 1
him 1
crybaby 1

it 1

be 1
wicked 1
to 1

a 1
day 1

times 1
but 1
somehow 1
i 1

by 1
one 1
day 1
i 1
asked 1

but 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
fool 1
she 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
why 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
no 1
way 1
i 1
set 1
down 1
one 1
time 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
if 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
get 1
anything 1
they 1
pray 1
for 1
why 1
dont 1
deacon 1
winn 1
get 1
back 1
the 1
money 1
he 1
lost 1
on 1
pork 1
why 1
cant 1
the 1
widow 1
get 1
back 1
her 1
silver 1
snuffbox 1
that 1
was 1
stole 1
why 1
cant 1
miss 1
watson 1
fat 1
up 1
no 1
says 1
i 1
to 1
my 1
self 1
there 1
aint 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
went 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
widow 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
thing 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
get 1
by 1
praying 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
spiritual 1
gifts 1
this 1
was 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
she 1
meanti 1
must 1
help 1
other 1
people 1
and 1
do 1
everything 1
i 1
could 1
for 1
other 1
people 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
them 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
never 1
think 1
about 1
myself 1
this 1
was 1
including 1
miss 1
watson 1
as 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
advantage 1
about 1
itexcept 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
people 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
worry 1
about 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
just 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
sometimes 1
the 1
widow 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
talk 1
about 1
providence 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
bodys 1
mouth 1
water 1
but 1
maybe 1
next 1
day 1
miss 1
watson 1
would 1
take 1
hold 1
and 1
knock 1
it 1
all 1
down 1
again 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
two 1
providences 1
and 1
a 1
poor 1
chap 1
would 1
stand 1
considerable 1
show 1
with 1
the 1
widows 1
providence 1
but 1
if 1
miss 1
watsons 1
got 1
him 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
and 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
widows 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
me 1
though 1
i 1
couldnt 1
make 1
out 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
agoing 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
better 1
off 1
then 1
than 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
seeing 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
ignorant 1
and 1
so 1
kind 1
of 1
lowdown 1
and 1
ornery 1
pap 1
he 1
hadnt 1
been 1
seen 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
comfortable 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
always 1
whale 1
me 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sober 1
and 1
could 1
get 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
me 1
though 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
around 1
well 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
drownded 1
about 1
twelve 1
mile 1
above 1
town 1
so 1
people 1
said 1
they 1
judged 1
it 1
was 1
him 1
anyway 1
said 1
this 1
drownded 1
man 1
was 1
just 1
his 1
size 1
and 1
was 1
ragged 1
and 1
had 1
uncommon 1
long 1
hair 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
like 1
pap 1
but 1
they 1
couldnt 1
make 1
nothing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
because 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
long 1
it 1
warnt 1
much 1
like 1
a 1
face 1
at 1
all 1
they 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
floating 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
and 1
buried 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
but 1
i 1
warnt 1
comfortable 1
long 1
because 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
i 1
knowed 1
mighty 1
well 1
that 1
a 1
drownded 1
man 1
dont 1
float 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
but 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
so 1
i 1
knowed 1
then 1
that 1
this 1
warnt 1
pap 1
but 1
a 1
woman 1
dressed 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
mans 1
clothes 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
uncomfortable 1
again 1
i 1
judged 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
again 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
though 1
i 1
wished 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
we 1
played 1
robber 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
resigned 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
did 1
we 1
hadnt 1
robbed 1
nobody 1
hadnt 1
killed 1
any 1
people 1
but 1
only 1
just 1
pretended 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
hop 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
go 1
charging 1
down 1
on 1
hogdrivers 1
and 1
women 1
in 1
carts 1
taking 1
garden 1
stuff 1
to 1
market 1
but 1
we 1
never 1
hived 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
called 1
the 1
hogs 1
ingots 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
the 1
turnips 1
and 1
stuff 1
julery 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
powwow 1
over 1
what 1
we 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
how 1
many 1
people 1
we 1
had 1
killed 1
and 1
marked 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
profit 1
in 1
it 1
one 1
time 1
tom 1
sent 1
a 1
boy 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
blazing 1
stick 1
which 1
he 1
called 1
a 1
slogan 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
sign 1
for 1
the 1
gang 1
to 1
get 1
together 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
secret 1
news 1
by 1
his 1
spies 1
that 1
next 1
day 1
a 1
whole 1
parcel 1
of 1
spanish 1
merchants 1
and 1
rich 1
arabs 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
camp 1
in 1
cave 1
hollow 1
with 1
two 1
hundred 1
elephants 1
and 1
six 1
hundred 1
camels 1
and 1
over 1
a 1
thousand 1
sumter 1
mules 1
all 1
loaded 1
down 1
with 1
dimonds 1
and 1
they 1
didnt 1
have 1
only 1
a 1
guard 1
of 1
four 1
hundred 1
soldiers 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
would 1
lay 1
in 1
ambuscade 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
and 1
kill 1
the 1
lot 1
and 1
scoop 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
must 1
slick 1
up 1
our 1
swords 1
and 1
guns 1
and 1
get 1
ready 1
he 1
never 1
could 1
go 1
after 1
even 1
a 1
turnipcart 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
the 1
swords 1
and 1
guns 1
all 1
scoured 1
up 1
for 1
it 1
though 1
they 1
was 1
only 1
lath 1
and 1
broomsticks 1
and 1
you 1
might 1
scour 1
at 1
them 1
till 1
you 1
rotted 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
warnt 1
worth 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
ashes 1
more 1
than 1
what 1
they 1
was 1
before 1
i 1
didnt 1
believe 1
we 1
could 1
lick 1
such 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
spaniards 1
and 1
arabs 1
but 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
camels 1
and 1
elephants 1
so 1
i 1
was 1
on 1
hand 1
next 1
day 1
saturday 1
in 1
the 1
ambuscade 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
word 1
we 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
but 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
spaniards 1
and 1
arabs 1
and 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
camels 1
nor 1
no 1
elephants 1
it 1
warnt 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
sundayschool 1
picnic 1
and 1
only 1
a 1
primerclass 1
at 1
that 1
we 1
busted 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
chased 1
the 1
children 1
up 1
the 1
hollow 1
but 1
we 1
never 1
got 1
anything 1
but 1
some 1
doughnuts 1
and 1
jam 1
though 1
ben 1
rogers 1
got 1
a 1
rag 1
doll 1
and 1
jo 1
harper 1
got 1
a 1
hymnbook 1
and 1
a 1
tract 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
teacher 1
charged 1
in 1
and 1
made 1
us 1
drop 1
everything 1
and 1
cut 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
no 1
dimonds 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
loads 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
anyway 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
arabs 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
elephants 1
and 1
things 1
i 1
said 1
why 1
couldnt 1
we 1
see 1
them 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
i 1
warnt 1
so 1
ignorant 1
but 1
had 1
read 1
a 1
book 1
called 1
don 1
quixote 1
i 1
would 1
know 1
without 1
asking 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
done 1
by 1
enchantment 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
hundreds 1
of 1
soldiers 1
there 1
and 1
elephants 1
and 1
treasure 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
enemies 1
which 1
he 1
called 1
magicians 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
turned 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
into 1
an 1
infant 1
sundayschool 1
just 1
out 1
of 1
spite 1
i 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
the 1
thing 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
magicians 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
numskull 1
why 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
magician 1
could 1
call 1
up 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
genies 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
hash 1

a 1
pack 1
of 1
flatheads 1
for 1
not 1
keeping 1
the 1
palace 1
themselves 1
stead 1
of 1
fooling 1
them 1
away 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
whats 1
moreif 1
i 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
i 1
would 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
jericho 1
before 1
i 1
would 1
drop 1
my 1
business 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
rubbing 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lamp 1
how 1
you 1
talk 1
huck 1
finn 1
why 1
youd 1
_have_ 1
to 1
come 1
when 1
he 1
rubbed 1
it 1
whether 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
or 1
not 1
what 1
and 1
i 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
church 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
i 1
_would_ 1
come 1
but 1
i 1
lay 1
id 1
make 1
that 1
man 1
climb 1
the 1
highest 1
tree 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
shucks 1
it 1
aint 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
huck 1
finn 1
you 1
dont 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
somehowperfect 1
saphead 1
i 1
thought 1
all 1
this 1
over 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
got 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lamp 1
and 1
an 1
iron 1
ring 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
rubbed 1
and 1
rubbed 1
till 1
i 1
sweat 1
like 1
an 1
injun 1
calculating 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
palace 1
and 1
sell 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
genies 1
come 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
judged 1
that 1
all 1
that 1
stuff 1
was 1
only 1
just 1
one 1
of 1
tom 1
sawyers 1
lies 1
i 1
reckoned 1
he 1
believed 1
in 1
the 1
arabs 1
and 1
the 1
elephants 1
but 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
different 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
a 1
sundayschool 1
chapter 1
iv 1
well 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
months 1
run 1
along 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
into 1
the 1
winter 1
now 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
school 1
most 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
could 1
spell 1
and 1
read 1
and 1
write 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
could 1
say 1
the 1
multiplication 1
table 1
up 1
to 1
six 1
times 1
seven 1
is 1
thirtyfive 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
reckon 1
i 1
could 1
ever 1
get 1
any 1
further 1
than 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
live 1
forever 1
i 1
dont 1
take 1
no 1
stock 1
in 1
mathematics 1
anyway 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
hated 1
the 1
school 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
got 1
so 1
i 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
whenever 1
i 1
got 1
uncommon 1
tired 1
i 1
played 1
hookey 1
and 1
the 1
hiding 1
i 1
got 1
next 1
day 1
done 1
me 1
good 1
and 1
cheered 1
me 1
up 1
so 1
the 1
longer 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
school 1
the 1
easier 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
sort 1
of 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
widows 1
ways 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
warnt 1
so 1
raspy 1
on 1
me 1
living 1
in 1
a 1
house 1
and 1
sleeping 1
in 1
a 1
bed 1
pulled 1
on 1
me 1
pretty 1
tight 1
mostly 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
cold 1
weather 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
slide 1
out 1
and 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
sometimes 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
rest 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
liked 1
the 1
old 1
ways 1
best 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
so 1
i 1
liked 1
the 1
new 1
ones 1
too 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
coming 1
along 1
slow 1
but 1
sure 1
and 1
doing 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
warnt 1
ashamed 1
of 1
me 1
one 1
morning 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
saltcellar 1
at 1

to 1
throw 1

started 1
out 1
after 1

and 1
shaky 1
and 1
wondering 1
where 1
it 1

on 1
me 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
going 1

be 1
there 1
is 1
ways 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
some 1
kinds 1
of 1
bad 1
luck 1
but 1
this 1
wasnt 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
kind 1
so 1
i 1
never 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
but 1
just 1

along 1
lowspirited 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
watchout 1

big 1
as 1
your 1
fist 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
took 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fourth 1
stomach 1
of 1
an 1
ox 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
magic 1
with 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
spirit 1
inside 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
knowed 1
everything 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
pap 1
was 1
here 1
again 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
his 1
tracks 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
was 1
he 1
going 1
to 1
stay 1
jim 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
hairball 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
it 1
fell 1
pretty 1
solid 1
and 1
only 1
rolled 1
about 1
an 1
inch 1
jim 1
tried 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
acted 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
jim 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
ear 1
against 1
it 1
and 1
listened 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
use 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
talk 1
he 1
said 1
sometimes 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
talk 1
without 1
money 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
slick 1
counterfeit 1
quarter 1
that 1
warnt 1
no 1
good 1
because 1
the 1
brass 1
showed 1
through 1
the 1
silver 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
pass 1
nohow 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
brass 1
didnt 1
show 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
slick 1
it 1
felt 1
greasy 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
would 1
tell 1
on 1
it 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
dollar 1
i 1
got 1
from 1
the 1
judge 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
bad 1
money 1
but 1
maybe 1
the 1
hairball 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
because 1
maybe 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
know 1
the 1
difference 1
jim 1
smelt 1
it 1
and 1
bit 1
it 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
manage 1
so 1
the 1
hairball 1
would 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
split 1
open 1
a 1
raw 1
irish 1
potato 1
and 1
stick 1
the 1
quarter 1
in 1
between 1
and 1
keep 1
it 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
you 1
couldnt 1
see 1
no 1
brass 1
and 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
feel 1
greasy 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
so 1
anybody 1
in 1
town 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
let 1
alone 1
a 1
hairball 1
well 1
i 1
knowed 1
a 1
potato 1
would 1
do 1
that 1
before 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
forgot 1
it 1
jim 1
put 1
the 1
quarter 1
under 1
the 1
hairball 1
and 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
listened 1
again 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
hairball 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
tell 1
my 1
whole 1
fortune 1
if 1
i 1
wanted 1
it 1
to 1
i 1
says 1
go 1
on 1
so 1
the 1
hairball 1
talked 1
to 1
jim 1
and 1

the 1

and 1
the 1
judge 1

so 1
they 1

again 1
and 1
when 1

way 1
to 1

i 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1

a 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
find 1
no 1
way 1
there 1
warnt 1
a 1
window 1

through 1
i 1
couldnt 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
chimbly 1
it 1

too 1
narrow 1
the 1

thick 1
solid 1
oak 1
slabs 1
pap 1

pretty 1
careful 1
not 1
to 1
leave 1
a 1
knife 1
or 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
away 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
had 1
hunted 1
the 1
place 1
over 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
found 1
something 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
woodsaw 1
without 1
any 1
handle 1
it 1
was 1
laid 1
in 1
between 1
a 1
rafter 1
and 1
the 1
clapboards 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
i 1
greased 1
it 1
up 1
and 1

an 1
old 1
horseblanket 1
nailed 1
against 1
the 1
logs 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
behind 1
the 1
table 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
wind 1
from 1
blowing 1
through 1
the 1
chinks 1
and 1
putting 1
the 1
candle 1
out 1
i 1
got 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
raised 1
the 1
blanket 1
and 1

a 1
section 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
bottom 1
log 1
outbig 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
through 1
well 1
it 1

a 1
good 1
long 1
job 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
towards 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
paps 1

in 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
and 1
dropped 1
the 1
blanket 1
and 1
hid 1
my 1
saw 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
pap 1
come 1
in 1
pap 1
warnt 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
humorso 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
natural 1
self 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
down 1
town 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
wrong 1
his 1
lawyer 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
would 1
win 1
his 1
lawsuit 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
money 1
if 1
they 1
ever 1
got 1
started 1
on 1
the 1
trial 1
but 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
ways 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
off 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
knowed 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
people 1
allowed 1
thered 1
be 1
another 1
trial 1
to 1
get 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
for 1
my 1
guardian 1
and 1
they 1
guessed 1
it 1
would 1
win 1
this 1
time 1
this 1
shook 1
me 1
up 1
considerable 1
because 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
widows 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
be 1
so 1
cramped 1
up 1
and 1
sivilized 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
got 1
to 1
cussing 1
and 1
cussed 1
everything 1
and 1
everybody 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
then 1
cussed 1
them 1
all 1
over 1
again 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
he 1
hadnt 1
skipped 1
any 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
polished 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
general 1
cuss 1
all 1
round 1
including 1
a 1
considerable 1
parcel 1
of 1
people 1
which 1
he 1
didnt 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
and 1
so 1
called 1
them 1
whatshisname 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
went 1
right 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
cussing 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
widow 1
get 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
watch 1
out 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
come 1
any 1
such 1
game 1
on 1
him 1
he 1
knowed 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
mile 1
off 1
to 1
stow 1
me 1
in 1
where 1
they 1
might 1
hunt 1
till 1
they 1
dropped 1
and 1
they 1
couldnt 1
find 1
me 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
pretty 1
uneasy 1
again 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
stay 1
on 1
hand 1
till 1
he 1
got 1
that 1
chance 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
made 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
fiftypound 1
sack 1
of 1
corn 1
meal 1
and 1
a 1
side 1
of 1
bacon 1
ammunition 1
and 1
a 1
fourgallon 1
jug 1
of 1
whisky 1
and 1
an 1
old 1
book 1
and 1
two 1
newspapers 1
for 1
wadding 1
besides 1
some 1
tow 1
i 1
toted 1
up 1
a 1
load 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
skiff 1
to 1
rest 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
walk 1
off 1
with 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
some 1
lines 1
and 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
i 1
run 1
away 1
i 1
guessed 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
stay 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
but 1
just 1
tramp 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
country 1
mostly 1
night 1
times 1
and 1
hunt 1
and 1
fish 1
to 1
keep 1
alive 1
and 1
so 1
get 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
nor 1
the 1
widow 1
couldnt 1
ever 1
find 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
would 1
saw 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
that 1
night 1
if 1
pap 1
got 1
drunk 1
enough 1
and 1
i 1
reckoned 1
he 1
would 1
i 1
got 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
didnt 1
notice 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
was 1
staying 1
till 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
hollered 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
i 1
was 1
asleep 1
or 1
drownded 1
i 1
got 1
the 1
things 1
all 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
dark 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
cooking 1
supper 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
took 1
a 1
swig 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
got 1
sort 1
of 1
warmed 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
ripping 1
again 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
drunk 1
over 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
laid 1
in 1
the 1
gutter 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
sight 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
a 1
body 1
would 1
a 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
adamhe 1

to 1

hold 1
of 1
a 1
prowling 1
thieving 1
infernal 1
whiteshirted 1
free 1
nigger 1
and 1
pap 1
was 1
agoing 1
on 1
so 1
he 1
never 1
noticed 1
where 1
his 1
old 1
limber 1
legs 1
was 1
taking 1
him 1
to 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
head 1
over 1
heels 1
over 1
the 1
tub 1
of 1
salt 1
pork 1
and 1
barked 1
both 1
shins 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
speech 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
hottest 1
kind 1
of 1
languagemostly 1
hove 1
at 1
the 1
nigger 1
and 1
the 1
govment 1
though 1
he 1
give 1
the 1
tub 1
some 1
too 1
all 1
along 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
hopped 1
around 1
the 1
cabin 1
considerable 1
first 1
on 1
one 1
leg 1
and 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
holding 1
first 1
one 1
shin 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
out 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
foot 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
fetched 1
the 1
tub 1
a 1
rattling 1
kick 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
good 1
judgment 1
because 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
boot 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
his 1
toes 1
leaking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
raised 1
a 1
howl 1
that 1
fairly 1
made 1
a 1
bodys 1
hair 1
raise 1
and 1
down 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
and 1
rolled 1
there 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
toes 1
and 1
the 1
cussing 1
he 1
done 1
then 1
laid 1
over 1
anything 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
previous 1
he 1
said 1
so 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
afterwards 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
old 1
sowberry 1
hagan 1
in 1
his 1
best 1
days 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
laid 1
over 1
him 1
too 1
but 1
i 1
reckon 1
that 1
was 1
sort 1
of 1
piling 1
it 1
on 1
maybe 1
after 1
supper 1
pap 1
took 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
enough 1
whisky 1
there 1
for 1
two 1
drunks 1
and 1
one 1
delirium 1
tremens 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
his 1
word 1
i 1
judged 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
blind 1
drunk 1
in 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
would 1
steal 1
the 1
key 1
or 1
saw 1
myself 1
out 1
one 1
or 1
tother 1
he 1
drank 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
tumbled 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
blankets 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
but 1
luck 1
didnt 1
run 1
my 1
way 1
he 1
didnt 1
go 1
sound 1
asleep 1
but 1
was 1
uneasy 1
he 1
groaned 1
and 1
moaned 1
and 1
thrashed 1
around 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
got 1
so 1
sleepy 1
i 1
couldnt 1
keep 1
my 1
eyes 1

limbs 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
floating 1
down 1
and 1
a 1
sprinkling 1
of 1
bark 1
so 1
i 1
knowed 1
the 1
river 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
rise 1
i 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
great 1
times 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
town 1
the 1
june 1
rise 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
luck 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
that 1
rise 1
begins 1
here 1
comes 1
cordwood 1
floating 1
down 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
log 1
raftssometimes 1
a 1
dozen 1
logs 1
together 1
so 1
all 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
catch 1
them 1
and 1
sell 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
woodyards 1
and 1
the 1
sawmill 1
i 1
went 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
with 1
one 1
eye 1
out 1
for 1
pap 1
and 1
tother 1
one 1
out 1
for 1
what 1
the 1
rise 1
might 1
fetch 1
along 1
well 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
canoe 1
just 1
a 1
beauty 1
too 1
about 1
thirteen 1
or 1
fourteen 1
foot 1
long 1
riding 1
high 1
like 1
a 1
duck 1
i 1
shot 1
headfirst 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
like 1
a 1
frog 1
clothes 1
and 1
all 1
on 1
and 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
canoe 1
i 1
just 1
expected 1
thered 1
be 1
somebody 1
laying 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
because 1
people 1
often 1
done 1
that 1
to 1
fool 1
folks 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
chap 1
had 1
pulled 1
a 1
skiff 1
out 1
most 1
to 1
it 1
theyd 1
raise 1
up 1
and 1
laugh 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
so 1
this 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
driftcanoe 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
i 1
clumb 1
in 1
and 1
paddled 1
her 1
ashore 1
thinks 1
i 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
will 1
be 1
glad 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
thisshes 1
worth 1
ten 1
dollars 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
shore 1
pap 1
wasnt 1
in 1
sight 1
yet 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
running 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
creek 1
like 1
a 1
gully 1
all 1
hung 1
over 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1
willows 1
i 1
struck 1
another 1
idea 1
i 1
judged 1
id 1
hide 1
her 1
good 1
and 1
then 1
stead 1
of 1
taking 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
i 1
run 1
off 1
id 1
go 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
about 1
fifty 1
mile 1
and 1
camp 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
for 1
good 1
and 1
not 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
rough 1
time 1
tramping 1
on 1
foot 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
shanty 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
coming 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
got 1
her 1
hid 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
out 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
willows 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
down 1
the 1
path 1
a 1
piece 1
just 1
drawing 1
a 1
bead 1
on 1
a 1
bird 1
with 1
his 1
gun 1
so 1
he 1
hadnt 1
seen 1
anything 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
along 1
i 1
was 1
hard 1
at 1
it 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
trot 1
line 1
he 1
abused 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
being 1
so 1
slow 1
but 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
fell 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
made 1
me 1
so 1
long 1
i 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
i 1
was 1
wet 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
asking 1
questions 1
we 1
got 1
five 1
catfish 1
off 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
while 1
we 1
laid 1
off 1
after 1
breakfast 1
to 1
sleep 1
up 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
being 1
about 1
wore 1
out 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
thinking 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
fix 1
up 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
keep 1
pap 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
from 1
trying 1
to 1
follow 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
certainer 1
thing 1
than 1
trusting 1
to 1
luck 1
to 1
get 1
far 1
enough 1
off 1
before 1
they 1
missed 1
me 1
you 1
see 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
might 1
happen 1
well 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
no 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
pap 1
raised 1
up 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
drink 1
another 1
barrel 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
another 1
time 1
a 1
man 1
comes 1
aprowling 1
round 1
here 1
you 1
roust 1
me 1
out 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
man 1
warnt 1
here 1
for 1
no 1
good 1
id 1
a 1
shot 1
him 1
next 1
time 1
you 1
roust 1
me 1
out 1
you 1
hear 1
then 1
he 1
dropped 1
down 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
saying 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
very 1
idea 1
i 1
wanted 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
i 1
can 1
fix 1
it 1
now 1
so 1
nobody 1
wont 1
think 1
of 1
following 1
me 1
about 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
we 1
turned 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
coming 1
up 1
pretty 1
fast 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
driftwood 1
going 1
by 1
on 1
the 1
rise 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
along 1
comes 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
log 1
raftnine 1
logs 1
fast 1
together 1
we 1
went 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
towed 1
it 1
ashore 1
then 1
we 1
had 1
dinner 1
anybody 1
but 1
pap 1
would 1
a 1
waited 1
and 1
seen 1
the 1
day 1
through 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
catch 1
more 1
stuff 1
but 1
that 1
warnt 1
paps 1
style 1
nine 1
logs 1
was 1
enough 1
for 1
one 1
time 1
he 1
must 1
shove 1
right 1
over 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
sell 1
so 1
he 1
locked 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
towing 1
the 1
raft 1

i 1
judged 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
come 1

night 1
i 1
waited 1
till 1

reckoned 1
he 1
had 1

good 1
deal 1
crawling 1
out 1

as 1
good 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
from 1
the 1
outside 1
by 1
scattering 1
dust 1
on 1
the 1
place 1
which 1
covered 1
up 1
the 1
smoothness 1
and 1
the 1
sawdust 1
then 1
i 1
fixed 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
log 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
and 1
put 1
two 1
rocks 1
under 1
it 1
and 1
one 1
against 1
it 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
bent 1
up 1
at 1
that 1
place 1
and 1
didnt 1
quite 1
touch 1
ground 1
if 1
you 1
stood 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
foot 1
away 1
and 1
didnt 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
sawed 1
you 1
wouldnt 1
never 1
notice 1
it 1
and 1
besides 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
it 1
warnt 1
likely 1
anybody 1
would 1
go 1
fooling 1
around 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
grass 1
clear 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
so 1
i 1
hadnt 1
left 1
a 1
track 1
i 1
followed 1
around 1
to 1
see 1
i 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
all 1
safe 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
a 1
piece 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
was 1
hunting 1
around 1
for 1
some 1
birds 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
wild 1
pig 1
hogs 1
soon 1
went 1
wild 1
in 1
them 1
bottoms 1
after 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
prairie 1
farms 1
i 1
shot 1
this 1
fellow 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
camp 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
smashed 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
beat 1
it 1
and 1
hacked 1
it 1
considerable 1
adoing 1
it 1
i 1
fetched 1
the 1
pig 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
back 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
hacked 1
into 1
his 1
throat 1
with 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
laid 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
bleed 1
i 1
say 1
ground 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
groundhard 1
packed 1
and 1
no 1
boards 1
well 1
next 1
i 1
took 1
an 1
old 1
sack 1
and 1
put 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
big 1
rocks 1
in 1
itall 1
i 1
could 1
dragand 1
i 1
started 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
pig 1
and 1
dragged 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
dumped 1
it 1
in 1
and 1
down 1
it 1
sunk 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
you 1
could 1
easy 1
see 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
been 1
dragged 1
over 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
did 1
wish 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
was 1
there 1
i 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
throw 1
in 1
the 1
fancy 1
touches 1
nobody 1
could 1
spread 1
himself 1
like 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
well 1
last 1
i 1
pulled 1
out 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
hair 1
and 1
blooded 1
the 1
axe 1
good 1
and 1
stuck 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
side 1
and 1
slung 1
the 1
axe 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
then 1
i 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
pig 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
breast 1
with 1
my 1
jacket 1
so 1
he 1
couldnt 1
drip 1
till 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
piece 1
below 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
then 1
dumped 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
now 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
something 1
else 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
meal 1
and 1
my 1
old 1
saw 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
fetched 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
bag 1
to 1
where 1
it 1
used 1
to 1
stand 1
and 1
ripped 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
saw 1
for 1
there 1
warnt 1
no 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
on 1
the 1
placepap 1
done 1
everything 1
with 1
his 1
claspknife 1
about 1
the 1
cooking 1
then 1
i 1
carried 1
the 1
sack 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
across 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
willows 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
a 1
shallow 1
lake 1
that 1
was 1
five 1
mile 1
wide 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
rushesand 1
ducks 1
too 1
you 1
might 1
say 1
in 1
the 1
season 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
slough 1
or 1
a 1
creek 1
leading 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
that 1
went 1
miles 1
away 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
where 1
but 1
it 1
didnt 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
the 1
meal 1
sifted 1
out 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
track 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
dropped 1
paps 1
whetstone 1
there 1
too 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
done 1
by 1
accident 1
then 1
i 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
rip 1
in 1
the 1
meal 1
sack 1
with 1
a 1
string 1
so 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
leak 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
my 1
saw 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
dark 1
now 1
so 1
i 1
dropped 1
the 1
canoe 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
under 1
some 1
willows 1
that 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
the 1
moon 1
to 1
rise 1
i 1
made 1
fast 1
to 1
a 1
willow 1
then 1
i 1
took 1
a 1
bite 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
laid 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
to 1
smoke 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
theyll 1
follow 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
that 1
sackful 1
of 1
rocks 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
then 1
drag 1
the 1
river 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
theyll 1
follow 1
that 1
meal 1
track 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1

hundreds 1
of 1

out 1

a 1
stretch 1
and 1

just 1
going 1
to 1
unhitch 1
and 1

when 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
listened 1
pretty 1
soon 1
i 1
made 1
it 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
dull 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
sound 1
that 1
comes 1
from 1
oars 1
working 1
in 1
rowlocks 1
when 1
its 1
a 1
still 1
night 1
i 1
peeped 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
willow 1
branches 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
wasa 1
skiff 1
away 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
couldnt 1
tell 1
how 1
many 1

acoming 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
abreast 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
see 1
there 1
warnt 1
but 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
thinks 1
i 1
maybe 1
its 1
pap 1
though 1
i 1
warnt 1
expecting 1
him 1
he 1
dropped 1
below 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
came 1
aswinging 1
up 1
shore 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
by 1
so 1
close 1
i 1
could 1
a 1
reached 1
out 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
touched 1
him 1
well 1

no 1
time 1
the 1
next 1
minute 1

was 1
aspinning 1
down 1

and 1
a 1
half 1
and 1

quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
because 1

might 1
see 1
me 1
and 1

and 1
a 1
smoke 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
pipe 1
looking 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
sky 1
not 1
a 1
cloud 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
sky 1
looks 1
ever 1
so 1
deep 1
when 1
you 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
your 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
moonshine 1
i 1
never 1
knowed 1
it 1
before 1
and 1
how 1
far 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
hear 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
such 1
nights 1
i 1
heard 1
people 1
talking 1
at 1
the 1
ferry 1

what 1
they 1
said 1
tooevery 1

one 1
of 1
the 1
short 1
ones 1
he 1
reckonedand 1
then 1
they 1
laughed 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
over 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
laughed 1
again 1
then 1
they 1
waked 1
up 1
another 1
fellow 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
and 1
laughed 1
but 1
he 1
didnt 1
laugh 1
he 1
ripped 1
out 1
something 1
brisk 1
and 1
said 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
the 1
first 1
fellow 1
said 1
he 1
lowed 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
old 1
womanshe 1

some 1
things 1

said 1
in 1
his 1
time 1
i 1
heard 1
one 1
man 1
say 1
it 1

nearly 1
three 1
oclock 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
daylight 1

wait 1
more 1
than 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
longer 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
talk 1
got 1
further 1
and 1
further 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
words 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
mumble 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
laugh 1
too 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
off 1
i 1
was 1
away 1
below 1
the 1
ferry 1
now 1
i 1
rose 1

middle 1
of 1
the 1

signs 1
of 1
the 1

shot 1
past 1
the 1
head 1
at 1
a 1
ripping 1
rate 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
so 1
swift 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
dead 1
water 1
and 1
landed 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
towards 1
the 1
illinois 1

log 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1

out 1
on 1
the 1

the 1
black 1
driftwood 1
and 1
away 1
over 1

up 1
stream 1
coming 1
along 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
watched 1
it 1
come 1
creeping 1
down 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
abreast 1
of 1
where 1
i 1
stood 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
man 1
say 1
stern 1

there 1
heave 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
stabboard 1
i 1

as 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
by 1
my 1
side 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
gray 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
now 1
so 1
i 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1

down 1
for 1
a 1
nap 1
before 1

after 1
eight 1
oclock 1

laid 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1

shade 1
thinking 1
about 1
things 1
and 1
feeling 1
rested 1
and 1
ruther 1
comfortable 1
and 1
satisfied 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
sun 1
out 1
at 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
holes 1
but 1
mostly 1
it 1
was 1
big 1
trees 1
all 1
about 1
and 1
gloomy 1
in 1
there 1
amongst 1
them 1
there 1
was 1
freckled 1
places 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
the 1
light 1
sifted 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
the 1
freckled 1
places 1
swapped 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
showing 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
breeze 1
up 1
there 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
squirrels 1
set 1
on 1
a 1
limb 1
and 1
jabbered 1
at 1
me 1
very 1
friendly 1
i 1
was 1
powerful 1
lazy 1
and 1
comfortabledidnt 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
cook 1
breakfast 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
dozing 1
off 1
again 1
when 1
i 1
thinks 1
i 1
hears 1
a 1
deep 1
sound 1
of 1
boom 1
away 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
i 1
rouses 1
up 1
and 1
rests 1
on 1
my 1
elbow 1
and 1
listens 1
pretty 1
soon 1
i 1
hears 1
it 1
again 1
i 1
hopped 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
smoke 1
laying 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
upabout 1
abreast 1
the 1
ferry 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
full 1
of 1
people 1
floating 1
along 1
down 1
i 1
knowed 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
boom 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
white 1
smoke 1
squirt 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ferryboats 1
side 1
you 1
see 1
they 1
was 1
firing 1
cannon 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
carcass 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
i 1
was 1
pretty 1
hungry 1
but 1
it 1
warnt 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
fire 1
because 1
they 1
might 1
see 1
the 1
smoke 1
so 1
i 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
cannonsmoke 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
boom 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
there 1
and 1
it 1
always 1
looks 1
pretty 1
on 1
a 1
summer 1
morningso 1
i 1
was 1
having 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
time 1
seeing 1
them 1
hunt 1
for 1
my 1
remainders 1
if 1
i 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
bite 1
to 1
eat 1
well 1
then 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
think 1
how 1
they 1
always 1
put 1
quicksilver 1
in 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
float 1
them 1
off 1
because 1
they 1
always 1
go 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
drownded 1
carcass 1
and 1
stop 1
there 1
so 1
says 1
i 1
ill 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
and 1
if 1
any 1
of 1
thems 1
floating 1
around 1
after 1
me 1
ill 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
show 1
i 1
changed 1
to 1
the 1
illinois 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
luck 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
and 1
i 1
warnt 1
disappointed 1
a 1
big 1
double 1
loaf 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
i 1
most 1
got 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
stick 1
but 1
my 1
foot 1
slipped 1
and 1
she 1
floated 1
out 1
further 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
was 1
where 1
the 1
current 1
set 1
in 1
the 1
closest 1
to 1
the 1
shorei 1
knowed 1
enough 1
for 1
that 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
along 1
comes 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
won 1
i 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
plug 1
and 1
shook 1
out 1
the 1
little 1
dab 1
of 1
quicksilver 1
and 1
set 1
my 1
teeth 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
bakers 1
breadwhat 1
the 1
quality 1
eat 1
none 1
of 1
your 1
lowdown 1
cornpone 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
amongst 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
set 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
munching 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
watching 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
and 1
very 1
well 1
satisfied 1
and 1
then 1
something 1
struck 1
me 1
i 1
says 1
now 1
i 1
reckon 1
the 1
widow 1
or 1
the 1
parson 1
or 1
somebody 1
prayed 1
that 1
this 1
bread 1
would 1
find 1
me 1
and 1
here 1
it 1
has 1
gone 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
so 1
there 1
aint 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
thingthat 1
is 1
theres 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
when 1
a 1
body 1
like 1
the 1
widow 1
or 1
the 1
parson 1
prays 1
but 1
it 1
dont 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
reckon 1
it 1
dont 1
work 1
for 1
only 1
just 1
the 1
right 1
kind 1
i 1
lit 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
long 1
smoke 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
watching 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
was 1
floating 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
i 1
allowed 1
id 1
have 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
aboard 1
when 1
she 1
come 1
along 1
because 1
she 1
would 1
come 1
in 1
close 1
where 1
the 1
bread 1
did 1
when 1
shed 1
got 1
pretty 1
well 1
along 1
down 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
put 1
out 1
my 1
pipe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
where 1
i 1
fished 1
out 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
behind 1
a 1
log 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
open 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
log 1
forked 1
i 1
could 1
peep 1
through 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
she 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
she 1
drifted 1
in 1
so 1
close 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
a 1
run 1
out 1
a 1
plank 1
and 1
walked 1

crowded 1
up 1
and 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
rails 1
nearly 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
kept 1
still 1
watching 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
might 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
firstrate 1
but 1

deef 1
with 1
the 1
noise 1
and 1
pretty 1
near 1
blind 1
with 1

floated 1
on 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
around 1
the 1
shoulder 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
booming 1
now 1
and 1

further 1
off 1
and 1

hour 1
i 1
didnt 1

to 1
the 1
foot 1
and 1
was 1
giving 1
it 1
up 1
but 1
they 1
didnt 1
yet 1
a 1
while 1
they 1
turned 1
around 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
channel 1
on 1
the 1
missouri 1
side 1
under 1
steam 1
and 1
booming 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
i 1
crossed 1
over 1
to 1
that 1
side 1
and 1
watched 1
them 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
abreast 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
they 1
quit 1
shooting 1
and 1
dropped 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
knowed 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
nobody 1

come 1
ahunting 1
after 1
me 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
traps 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
nice 1
camp 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
woods 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
tent 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
blankets 1
to 1
put 1
my 1
things 1
under 1
so 1
the 1
rain 1
couldnt 1
get 1
at 1
them 1
i 1
catched 1
a 1
catfish 1
and 1
haggled 1
him 1
open 1
with 1
my 1
saw 1
and 1
towards 1
sundown 1
i 1
started 1
my 1
camp 1
fire 1
and 1
had 1
supper 1
then 1
i 1
set 1
out 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
catch 1
some 1
fish 1
for 1
breakfast 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
i 1
set 1
by 1
my 1
camp 1
fire 1
smoking 1
and 1
feeling 1
pretty 1
well 1
satisfied 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
it 1
got 1
sort 1
of 1
lonesome 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
went 1
and 1
set 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
current 1
swashing 1
along 1
and 1
counted 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
drift 1
logs 1
and 1
rafts 1
that 1
come 1
down 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
there 1
aint 1
no 1
better 1
way 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
time 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
lonesome 1
you 1
cant 1
stay 1
so 1
you 1
soon 1
get 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
no 1
differencejust 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
but 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
i 1
went 1
exploring 1
around 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
was 1
boss 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
all 1
belonged 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
mainly 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
found 1
plenty 1
strawberries 1
ripe 1
and 1
prime 1
and 1
green 1
summer 1
grapes 1
and 1
green 1
razberries 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
blackberries 1
was 1
just 1
beginning 1
to 1
show 1
they 1
would 1
all 1
come 1
handy 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
judged 1
well 1
i 1
went 1
fooling 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
woods 1
till 1
i 1
judged 1
i 1
warnt 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
gun 1
along 1
but 1
i 1
hadnt 1
shot 1
nothing 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
protection 1
thought 1
i 1
would 1
kill 1
some 1
game 1
nigh 1
home 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
mighty 1
near 1
stepped 1
on 1
a 1
goodsized 1
snake 1
and 1
it 1
went 1
sliding 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
flowers 1
and 1
i 1
after 1
it 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
shot 1
at 1
it 1
i 1
clipped 1
along 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
i 1
bounded 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
a 1
camp 1
fire 1
that 1
was 1
still 1
smoking 1
my 1
heart 1
jumped 1
up 1
amongst 1
my 1
lungs 1
i 1
never 1
waited 1
for 1
to 1
look 1
further 1
but 1
uncocked 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
went 1
sneaking 1
back 1
on 1
my 1
tiptoes 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
ever 1
i 1
could 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
stopped 1
a 1
second 1
amongst 1
the 1
thick 1
leaves 1
and 1
listened 1
but 1
my 1
breath 1
come 1
so 1
hard 1
i 1
couldnt 1
hear 1
nothing 1
else 1
i 1
slunk 1
along 1
another 1
piece 1
further 1
then 1
listened 1
again 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
if 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
stump 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
if 1
i 1
trod 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
broke 1
it 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
like 1
a 1
person 1
had 1
cut 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
breaths 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
got 1
half 1
and 1
the 1
short 1
half 1
too 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
camp 1
i 1
warnt 1
feeling 1
very 1
brash 1
there 1
warnt 1
much 1
sand 1
in 1
my 1
craw 1
but 1
i 1
says 1
this 1
aint 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
fooling 1
around 1
so 1
i 1
got 1
all 1
my 1
traps 1
into 1
my 1
canoe 1
again 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
i 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
scattered 1
the 1
ashes 1
around 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
last 1
years 1
camp 1
and 1
then 1
clumb 1
a 1
tree 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
was 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
two 1
hours 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
nothing 1
i 1
didnt 1
hear 1
nothingi 1
only 1
_thought_ 1
i 1
heard 1
and 1
seen 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
well 1
i 1
couldnt 1
stay 1
up 1
there 1
forever 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
got 1
down 1
but 1
i 1
kept 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
woods 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
all 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
to 1
eat 1
was 1
berries 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
left 1
over 1
from 1
breakfast 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
pretty 1
hungry 1
so 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
dark 1
i 1
slid 1
out 1
from 1
shore 1
before 1
moonrise 1
and 1
paddled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
illinois 1
bankabout 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
cooked 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
about 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
would 1
stay 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
_plunketyplunk 1
plunketyplunk_ 1
and 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
horses 1
coming 1
and 1
next 1
i 1
hear 1
peoples 1
voices 1
i 1
got 1
everything 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
creeping 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
i 1
could 1
find 1
out 1
i 1
hadnt 1
got 1
far 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
man 1
say 1

good 1
place 1

about 1
beat 1
out 1
lets 1
look 1
around 1
i 1
didnt 1
wait 1
but 1
shoved 1
out 1
and 1
paddled 1
away 1
easy 1
i 1
tied 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
place 1
and 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
i 1
didnt 1
sleep 1
much 1
i 1
couldnt 1
somehow 1
for 1
thinking 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
i 1
waked 1
up 1
i 1
thought 1
somebody 1
had 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
neck 1
so 1
the 1
sleep 1
didnt 1
do 1
me 1
no 1
good 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1

way 1
im 1
agoing 1
to 1

on 1
the 1
island 1

me 1
ill 1
find 1
it 1
out 1
or 1
bust 1
well 1
i 1
felt 1
better 1
right 1
off 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
paddle 1
and 1
slid 1
out 1
from 1
shore 1
just 1
a 1
step 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
the 1
canoe 1
drop 1
along 1
down 1
amongst 1
the 1
shadows 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
shining 1
and 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
shadows 1
it 1
made 1
it 1
most 1
as 1
light 1
as 1
day 1
i 1
poked 1
along 1
well 1
on 1
to 1
an 1
hour 1
everything 1
still 1
as 1
rocks 1
and 1
sound 1
asleep 1
well 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
a 1
little 1
ripply 1
cool 1
breeze 1
begun 1
to 1
blow 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
saying 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
about 1
done 1
i 1
give 1
her 1
a 1
turn 1
with 1
the 1
paddle 1
and 1
brung 1
her 1
nose 1
to 1
shore 1
then 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
moon 1
go 1
off 1
watch 1
and 1
the 1
darkness 1
begin 1
to 1
blanket 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
pale 1
streak 1
over 1
the 1
treetops 1
and 1
knowed 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
coming 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
slipped 1
off 1
towards 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
run 1
across 1
that 1
camp 1
fire 1
stopping 1
every 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
to 1

but 1
i 1
hadnt 1
no 1
luck 1
somehow 1
i 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
place 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
sure 1
enough 1
i 1
catched 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
fire 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1

went 1
for 1
it 1
cautious 1
and 1
slow 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
was 1
close 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
there 1

a 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
most 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
fantods 1

birds 1
come 1
along 1
flying 1
a 1
yard 1
or 1
two 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
lighting 1
jim 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rain 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
when 1
young 1
chickens 1
flew 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
reckoned 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
when 1
young 1
birds 1
done 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
catch 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
jim 1
wouldnt 1
let 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
death 1
he 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
laid 1

sick 1
once 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
catched 1
a 1

his 1
father 1
would 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
jim 1
said 1
you 1
mustnt 1
count 1
the 1
things 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
cook 1
for 1
dinner 1
because 1
that 1
would 1
bring 1
bad 1
luck 1
the 1
same 1
if 1
you 1
shook 1
the 1
tablecloth 1
after 1
sundown 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
owned 1
a 1
beehive 1
and 1
that 1
man 1
died 1
the 1
bees 1
must 1
be 1
told 1
about 1
it 1
before 1
sunup 1
next 1
morning 1
or 1
else 1
the 1
bees 1
would 1
all 1
weaken 1
down 1
and 1
quit 1
work 1
and 1
die 1
jim 1
said 1
bees 1
wouldnt 1
sting 1
idiots 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
believe 1
that 1
because 1
i 1
had 1
tried 1
them 1
lots 1
of 1
times 1
myself 1
and 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
sting 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
about 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
things 1
before 1

i 1

and 1
look 1
at 1
a 1
place 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
that 1
id 1
found 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
exploring 1
so 1
we 1
started 1
and 1
soon 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
because 1
the 1
island 1
was 1
only 1
three 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
this 1
place 1
was 1
a 1
tolerable 1
long 1
steep 1
hill 1
or 1
ridge 1
about 1
forty 1
foot 1
high 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
rough 1
time 1
getting 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
the 1
sides 1
was 1
so 1
steep 1
and 1
the 1
bushes 1
so 1
thick 1
we 1
tramped 1
and 1
clumb 1
around 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
found 1
a 1
good 1
big 1
cavern 1
in 1
the 1
rock 1
most 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
towards 1
illinois 1
the 1
cavern 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
rooms 1
bunched 1
together 1
and 1
jim 1
could 1
stand 1
up 1
straight 1
in 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
cool 1
in 1
there 1
jim 1
was 1
for 1
putting 1
our 1
traps 1
in 1
there 1
right 1
away 1
but 1
i 1
said 1
we 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
climbing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
there 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
jim 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
canoe 1
hid 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
and 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
in 1
the 1
cavern 1
we 1
could 1
rush 1
there 1
if 1
anybody 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
find 1
us 1
without 1
dogs 1
and 1
besides 1
he 1
said 1
them 1
little 1
birds 1
had 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
did 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
things 1
to 1
get 1
wet 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
paddled 1
up 1
abreast 1
the 1
cavern 1
and 1
lugged 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
up 1
there 1
then 1
we 1
hunted 1
up 1
a 1
place 1
close 1
by 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
canoe 1
in 1
amongst 1
the 1
thick 1
willows 1
we 1
took 1
some 1
fish 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
again 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
ready 1
for 1
dinner 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
was 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
roll 1
a 1
hogshead 1
in 1
and 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
floor 1
stuck 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
and 1
was 1
flat 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
so 1
we 1
built 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
cooked 1
dinner 1
we 1
spread 1
the 1
blankets 1
inside 1
for 1
a 1
carpet 1
and 1
eat 1
our 1
dinner 1
in 1
there 1
we 1
put 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
handy 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
pretty 1
soon 1
it 1
darkened 1
up 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
thunder 1
and 1
lighten 1
so 1
the 1
birds 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
it 1
directly 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
it 1
rained 1
like 1
all 1
fury 1
too 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
the 1
wind 1
blow 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
regular 1
summer 1
storms 1
it 1
would 1
get 1
so 1
dark 1
that 1
it 1
looked 1
all 1
blueblack 1
outside 1
and 1
lovely 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
would 1
thrash 1
along 1
by 1
so 1
thick 1
that 1
the 1
trees 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
looked 1
dim 1
and 1
spiderwebby 1
and 1
here 1
would 1
come 1
a 1
blast 1
of 1
wind 1
that 1
would 1
bend 1
the 1
trees 1
down 1
and 1
turn 1
up 1
the 1
pale 1
underside 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
perfect 1
ripper 1
of 1
a 1
gust 1
would 1
follow 1
along 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
branches 1
to 1
tossing 1
their 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
just 1
wild 1
and 1
next 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
about 1
the 1
bluest 1
and 1
blackest_fst_ 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
glory 1
and 1
youd 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
treetops 1
aplunging 1
about 1
away 1
off 1
yonder 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
hundreds 1
of 1
yards 1
further 1
than 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
before 1
dark 1
as 1
sin 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
now 1
youd 1
hear 1
the 1
thunder 1
let 1
go 1
with 1
an 1
awful 1
crash 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
rumbling 1
grumbling 1
tumbling 1
down 1
the 1
sky 1
towards 1
the 1
under 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
like 1
rolling 1
empty 1
barrels 1
down 1

raising 1

ten 1
or 1
twelve 1
days 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
banks 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
foot 1
deep 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
in 1
the 1
low 1
places 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
illinois 1
bottom 1
on 1
that 1
side 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
miles 1
wide 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
missouri 1
side 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
old 1
distance 1
acrossa 1
half 1
a 1
milebecause 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
wall 1
of 1
high 1
bluffs 1
daytimes 1
we 1
paddled 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
island 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
it 1
was 1
mighty 1
cool 1
and 1
shady 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
woods 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
blazing 1
outside 1
we 1
went 1
winding 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
amongst 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
sometimes 1
the 1
vines 1
hung 1
so 1
thick 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
back 1
away 1
and 1
go 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
well 1
on 1
every 1
old 1
brokendown 1
tree 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
rabbits 1
and 1
snakes 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
island 1
had 1
been 1
overflowed 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
they 1
got 1
so 1
tame 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
being 1
hungry 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
paddle 1
right 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
your 1
hand 1
on 1
them 1
if 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
turtlesthey 1
would 1
slide 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
ridge 1
our 1
cavern 1
was 1
in 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
them 1
we 1
could 1
a 1
had 1
pets 1
enough 1
if 1
wed 1
wanted 1
them 1
one 1
night 1
we 1
catched 1
a 1
little 1
section 1
of 1
a 1
lumber 1
raftnice 1
pine 1
planks 1
it 1
was 1
twelve 1
foot 1
wide 1
and 1
about 1
fifteen 1
or 1
sixteen 1
foot 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
top 1
stood 1
above 1
water 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
inchesa 1
solid 1
level 1
floor 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
sawlogs 1
go 1
by 1
in 1
the 1
daylight 1
sometimes 1
but 1
we 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
we 1
didnt 1
show 1
ourselves 1
in 1
daylight 1
another 1
night 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
just 1
before 1
daylight 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
framehouse 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
west 1
side 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
twostory 1
and 1
tilted 1
over 1
considerable 1
we 1
paddled 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
aboardclumb 1
in 1
at 1
an 1
upstairs 1
window 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
dark 1
to 1
see 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
made 1
the 1
canoe 1
fast 1
and 1
set 1
in 1
her 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
daylight 1
the 1

off 1
the 1
snakes 1
head 1
and 1
throw 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
then 1

the 1
body 1
and 1
roast 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
eat 1
it 1
and 1

help 1
cure 1
him 1
he 1
made 1
me 1
take 1
off 1
the 1
rattles 1
and 1
tie 1
them 1
around 1
his 1
wrist 1
too 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
that 1
would 1
help 1
then 1
i 1
slid 1
out 1
quiet 1
and 1
throwed 1
the 1
snakes 1
clear 1
away 1
amongst 1
the 1
bushes 1
for 1
i 1
warnt 1
going 1
to 1
let 1
jim 1
find 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
my 1
fault 1
not 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
help 1
it 1
jim 1
sucked 1
and 1
sucked 1
at 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
pitched 1
around 1
and 1
yelled 1
but 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
himself 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sucking 1
at 1
the 1
jug 1
again 1
his 1
foot 1
swelled 1
up 1
pretty 1
big 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
his 1
leg 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
drunk 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
judged 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
id 1
druther 1
been 1
bit 1
with 1
a 1
snake 1
than 1
paps 1
whisky 1
jim 1
was 1
laid 1
up 1
for 1
four 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
then 1
the 1
swelling 1
was 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
around 1
again 1
i 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
ever 1
take 1
aholt 1
of 1
a 1
snakeskin 1
again 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
what 1
had 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
jim 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
i 1
would 1
believe 1
him 1
next 1
time 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
handling 1
a 1
snakeskin 1
was 1
such 1
awful 1
bad 1
luck 1
that 1
maybe 1
we 1
hadnt 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
yet 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
druther 1
see 1
the 1
new 1
moon 1
over 1
his 1
left 1
shoulder 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
than 1
take 1
up 1
a 1
snakeskin 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
to 1
feel 1
that 1
way 1
myself 1
though 1
ive 1
always 1
reckoned 1
that 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
new 1
moon 1
over 1
your 1
left 1
shoulder 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
carelessest 1
and 1
foolishest 1
things 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
do 1
old 1
hank 1
bunker 1
done 1
it 1
once 1
and 1
bragged 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
two 1
years 1
he 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
fell 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
shottower 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
out 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
layer 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
and 1
they 1
slid 1
him 1
edgeways 1
between 1
two 1
barn 1
doors 1
for 1
a 1
coffin 1
and 1
buried 1
him 1
so 1
so 1
they 1
say 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
it 1
pap 1
told 1
me 1
but 1
anyway 1
it 1
all 1
come 1
of 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
moon 1
that 1
way 1
like 1
a 1
fool 1
well 1
the 1
days 1
went 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
went 1
down 1
between 1
its 1
banks 1
again 1
and 1
about 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
we 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
bait 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
hooks 1
with 1
a 1
skinned 1
rabbit 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
and 1
catch 1
a 1
catfish 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
being 1
six 1
foot 1
two 1
inches 1
long 1
and 1
weighed 1
over 1
two 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
we 1
couldnt 1
handle 1
him 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
flung 1
us 1
into 1
illinois 1
we 1
just 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
around 1
till 1
he 1
drownded 1
we 1
found 1
a 1
brass 1
button 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
and 1
a 1
round 1
ball 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
rubbage 1
we 1
split 1
the 1
ball 1
open 1
with 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
spool 1
in 1
it 1
jim 1
said 1
hed 1
had 1
it 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
coat 1
it 1
over 1
so 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
ball 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
a 1
fish 1
as 1
was 1
ever 1
catched 1
in 1
the 1
mississippi 1
i 1
reckon 1
jim 1
said 1

hadnt 1
ever 1
seen 1
a 1
bigger 1
one 1
he 1

a 1
been 1
worth 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
they 1
peddle 1
out 1
such 1
a 1

he 1
said 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
look 1
sharp 1
then 1
he 1
studied 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
said 1

i 1
put 1
on 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
old 1
things 1
and 1
dress 1
up 1
like 1
a 1

was 1
a 1
good 1
notion 1
too 1
so 1
we 1

of 1

and 1
i 1
turned 1
up 1
my 1

and 1
got 1
into 1
it 1
jim 1
hitched 1
it 1
behind 1
with 1
the 1
hooks 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fair 1
fit 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
sunbonnet 1
and 1
tied 1
it 1
under 1
my 1
chin 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
a 1
body 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
face 1
was 1
like 1
looking 1
down 1
a 1
joint 1
of 1
stovepipe 1
jim 1
said 1
nobody 1
would 1
know 1
me 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
hardly 1
i 1
practiced 1
around 1
all 1
day 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
hang 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
pretty 1
well 1
in 1
them 1
only 1
jim 1
said 1
i 1

the 1

of 1
the 1

little 1
for 1

now 1
that 1
he 1

of 1
it 1
has 1
everybody 1

from 1
here 1
im 1
one 1
of 1
thembut 1
i 1
haint 1
talked 1
it 1
around 1
a 1
few 1
days 1

i 1

talking 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
couple 1
that 1
lives 1
next 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
log 1
shanty 1
and 1
they 1
happened 1
to 1
say 1
hardly 1
anybody 1
ever 1
goes 1
to 1
that 1
island 1
over 1
yonder 1
that 1
they 1
call 1
jacksons 1
island 1
dont 1
anybody 1
live 1
there 1
says 1
i 1
no 1
nobody 1
says 1
they 1
i 1
didnt 1
say 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
i 1
done 1
some 1
thinking 1
i 1
was 1
pretty 1
near 1
certain 1
id 1
seen 1
smoke 1
over 1
there 1
about 1

a 1
day 1
or 1

myself 1
like 1
as 1
not 1
that 1
niggers 1
hiding 1

yourself 1
up 1
a 1

about 1
six 1

seven 1
foot 1
throw 1

a 1
girl 1

the 1
wrist 1
and 1
elbow 1
with 1
your 1
arm 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
side 1

a 1
boy 1
and 1
mind 1
you 1
when 1
a 1
girl 1
tries 1
to 1

anything 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
she 1
throws 1
her 1
knees 1
apart 1
she 1
dont 1
clap 1
them 1
together 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
did 1
when 1
you 1
catched 1
the 1
lump 1
of 1
lead 1
why 1
i 1
spotted 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
boy 1
when 1
you 1
was 1
threading 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
i 1
contrived 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
just 1
to 1
make 1
certain 1
now 1
trot 1
along 1
to 1
your 1
uncle 1
sarah 1
mary 1
williams 1
george 1
elexander 1
peters 1

to 1
mrs 1
judith 1
loftus 1
which 1
is 1
me 1
and 1
ill 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
can 1
to 1
get 1
you 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
keep 1
the 1
river 1
road 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
next 1
time 1
you 1
tramp 1
take 1
shoes 1
and 1
socks 1
with 1
you 1
the 1
river 1
roads 1
a 1
rocky 1
one 1
and 1
your 1
feetll 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
condition 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
goshen 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
went 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
about 1
fifty 1
yards 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
doubled 1
on 1
my 1
tracks 1
and 1
slipped 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
canoe 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
piece 1
below 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
jumped 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
i 1
went 1
upstream 1
far 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
then 1
started 1
across 1
i 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
sunbonnet 1
for 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
no 1
blinders 1
on 1
then 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
begin 1
to 1
strike 1
so 1
i 1
stops 1
and 1
listens 1
the 1
sound 1
come 1
faint 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
but 1
cleareleven 1
when 1
i 1
struck 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
never 1
waited 1
to 1
blow 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
winded 1
but 1
i 1
shoved 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
timber 1
where 1
my 1
old 1
camp 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
started 1
a 1
good 1
fire 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
high 1
and 1
dry 1
spot 1
then 1
i 1
jumped 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
dug 1
out 1
for 1
our 1
place 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
below 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
i 1
landed 1
and 1
slopped 1
through 1
the 1
timber 1
and 1
up 1
the 1
ridge 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
cavern 1
there 1
jim 1
laid 1
sound 1
asleep 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
roused 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
says 1

up 1
and 1
hump 1

a 1
minute 1
to 1

after 1
us 1
jim 1
never 1
asked 1
no 1
questions 1
he 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
but 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
worked 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
showed 1
about 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
scared 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
everything 1
we 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
on 1
our 1
raft 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
shoved 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
willow 1
cove 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
hid 1
we 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
camp 1
fire 1
at 1
the 1
cavern 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
and 1
didnt 1
show 1
a 1
candle 1
outside 1
after 1
that 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
but 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
boat 1
around 1
i 1
couldnt 1
see 1
it 1
for 1
stars 1
and 1
shadows 1
aint 1
good 1
to 1
see 1
by 1
then 1
we 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
slipped 1
along 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
past 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
dead 1
stillnever 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
chapter 1
xii 1
it 1
must 1
a 1
been 1
close 1
on 1
to 1
one 1
oclock 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
below 1
the 1
island 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
did 1
seem 1
to 1
go 1
mighty 1
slow 1
if 1
a 1
boat 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
along 1
we 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
break 1
for 1
the 1
illinois 1
shore 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
a 1
boat 1
didnt 1
come 1
for 1
we 1
hadnt 1
ever 1
thought 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
gun 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
or 1
a 1
fishingline 1
or 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
ruther 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
so 1
many 1
things 1
it 1
warnt 1
good 1
judgment 1
to 1
put 1
_everything_ 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
if 1
the 1
men 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
just 1
expect 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
camp 1
fire 1
i 1
built 1
and 1
watched 1
it 1
all 1
night 1
for 1
jim 1
to 1
come 1
anyways 1
they 1
stayed 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
and 1
if 1
my 1
building 1
the 1
fire 1
never 1
fooled 1
them 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
fault 1
of 1
mine 1
i 1
played 1
it 1
as 1
low 1
down 1
on 1
them 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
streak 1
of 1
day 1
began 1
to 1
show 1
we 1
tied 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
towhead 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
on 1
the 1
illinois 1
side 1
and 1
hacked 1
off 1
cottonwood 1
branches 1
with 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
covered 1
up 1
the 1
raft 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
she 1
looked 1
like 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
cavein 1
in 1
the 1
bank 1
there 1
a 1
towhead 1
is 1
a 1
sandbar 1
that 1
has 1
cottonwoods 1
on 1
it 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
harrowteeth 1
we 1
had 1
mountains 1
on 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
heavy 1
timber 1
on 1
the 1
illinois 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
channel 1
was 1
down 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
at 1
that 1
place 1
so 1
we 1
warnt 1
afraid 1
of 1
anybody 1
running 1
across 1
us 1
we 1
laid 1
there 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
rafts 1
and 1
steamboats 1
spin 1
down 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
upbound 1
steamboats 1
fight 1
the 1
big 1
river 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
i 1
told 1
jim 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
had 1
jabbering 1
with 1
that 1
woman 1
and 1
jim 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
smart 1
one 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
start 1
after 1
us 1
herself 1
she 1
wouldnt 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
watch 1
a 1
camp 1
fireno 1
sir 1
shed 1
fetch 1
a 1
dog 1
well 1
then 1
i 1
said 1
why 1
couldnt 1
she 1
tell 1
her 1
husband 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
dog 1
jim 1
said 1
he 1
bet 1
she 1
did 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
men 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
start 1
and 1
he 1
believed 1
they 1
must 1
a 1
gone 1
uptown 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
dog 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
lost 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
or 1
else 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
here 1
on 1
a 1
towhead 1
sixteen 1
or 1
seventeen 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
villageno 1
indeedy 1
we 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
that 1
same 1
old 1
town 1
again 1
so 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
didnt 1
care 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
they 1
didnt 1
get 1
us 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
didnt 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
dark 1
we 1
poked 1
our 1
heads 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cottonwood 1
thicket 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
and 1
across 1
nothing 1
in 1
sight 1
so 1
jim 1
took 1
up 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
planks 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
built 1
a 1
snug 1
wigwam 1
to 1
get 1
under 1
in 1
blazing 1
weather 1
and 1
rainy 1
and 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
things 1
dry 1
jim 1
made 1
a 1
floor 1
for 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
raised 1
it 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
more 1
above 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
blankets 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
steamboat 1
waves 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
dirt 1
about 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
inches 1
deep 1
with 1
a 1
frame 1
around 1
it 1
for 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
in 1
sloppy 1
weather 1
or 1
chilly 1
the 1
wigwam 1
would 1
keep 1
it 1
from 1
being 1
seen 1
we 1
made 1
an 1
extra 1
steeringoar 1
too 1
because 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
might 1
get 1
broke 1
on 1
a 1
snag 1
or 1
something 1
we 1
fixed 1
up 1
a 1
short 1
forked 1
stick 1
to 1
hang 1
the 1
old 1
lantern 1
on 1
because 1
we 1
must 1
always 1
light 1
the 1
lantern 1
whenever 1
we 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
coming 1
downstream 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
getting 1
run 1
over 1
but 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
to 1
light 1
it 1
for 1
upstream 1
boats 1
unless 1
we 1
see 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
a 1
crossing 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
pretty 1
high 1
yet 1
very 1
low 1
banks 1
being 1
still 1
a 1
little 1
under 1
water 1
so 1
upbound 1
boats 1
didnt 1
always 1
run 1
the 1
channel 1
but 1
hunted 1
easy 1
water 1
this 1
second 1
night 1
we 1
run 1
between 1
seven 1
and 1
eight 1
hours 1
with 1
a 1
current 1
that 1
was 1
making 1
over 1
four 1
mile 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
catched 1
fish 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
swim 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
sleepiness 1
it 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
solemn 1
drifting 1
down 1
the 1
big 1
still 1
river 1
laying 1
on 1
our 1
backs 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
we 1
didnt 1
ever 1
feel 1
like 1
talking 1
loud 1
and 1
it 1
warnt 1
often 1
that 1
we 1
laughedonly 1
a 1
little 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
low 1
chuckle 1
we 1
had 1
mighty 1
good 1
weather 1
as 1
a 1
general 1
thing 1
and 1
nothing 1
ever 1
happened 1
to 1
us 1
at 1
allthat 1
night 1
nor 1
the 1
next 1
nor 1
the 1
next 1
every 1
night 1
we 1
passed 1
towns 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
away 1
up 1
on 1
black 1
hillsides 1
nothing 1
but 1
just 1
a 1
shiny 1
bed 1
of 1
lights 1
not 1
a 1
house 1
could 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
fifth 1
night 1
we 1
passed 1
st 1
louis 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
lit 1
up 1
in 1
st 1
petersburg 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
there 1
was 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
people 1
in 1
st 1
louis 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
believed 1
it 1
till 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
wonderful 1
spread 1
of 1
lights 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
that 1
still 1
night 1
there 1
warnt 1
a 1
sound 1
there 1
everybody 1
was 1
asleep 1
every 1
night 1
now 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
slip 1
ashore 1
towards 1
ten 1
oclock 1
at 1
some 1
little 1
village 1
and 1
buy 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
cents 1
worth 1
of 1
meal 1
or 1
bacon 1
or 1
other 1
stuff 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
sometimes 1
i 1
lifted 1
a 1
chicken 1
that 1
warnt 1
roosting 1
comfortable 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
along 1
pap 1
always 1
said 1
take 1
a 1
chicken 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
because 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
want 1
him 1
yourself 1
you 1
can 1
easy 1
find 1
somebody 1
that 1
does 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
deed 1
aint 1
ever 1
forgot 1
i 1
never 1
see 1
pap 1
when 1
he 1
didnt 1
want 1
the 1
chicken 1
himself 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
anyway 1
mornings 1
before 1
daylight 1
i 1
slipped 1
into 1
cornfields 1
and 1
borrowed 1
a 1
watermelon 1
or 1
a 1
mushmelon 1
or 1
a 1
punkin 1
or 1
some 1
new 1
corn 1
or 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
pap 1
always 1
said 1
it 1
warnt 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
borrow 1
things 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
meaning 1
to 1
pay 1
them 1
back 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
it 1
warnt 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
soft 1
name 1
for 1
stealing 1
and 1
no 1
decent 1
body 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
jim 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
the 1
widow 1
was 1
partly 1
right 1
and 1
pap 1
was 1
partly 1
right 1
so 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
pick 1
out 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
things 1
from 1
the 1
list 1
and 1
say 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
borrow 1
them 1
any 1
morethen 1
he 1
reckoned 1
it 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
borrow 1
the 1
others 1
so 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
all 1
one 1
night 1
drifting 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
whether 1
to 1
drop 1
the 1
watermelons 1
or 1
the 1
cantelopes 1
or 1
the 1
mushmelons 1
or 1
what 1
but 1
towards 1
daylight 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
all 1
settled 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
concluded 1
to 1
drop 1
crabapples 1
and 1
psimmons 1
we 1
warnt 1
feeling 1
just 1
right 1
before 1
that 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
comfortable 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
come 1
out 1
too 1
because 1
crabapples 1
aint 1
ever 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
psimmons 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
ripe 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
months 1
yet 1
we 1
shot 1
a 1
waterfowl 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
that 1
got 1
up 1
too 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
or 1
didnt 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
round 1
we 1
lived 1
pretty 1
high 1
the 1
fifth 1
night 1
below 1
st 1
louis 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
big 1
storm 1
after 1
midnight 1
with 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
thunder 1
and 1
lightning 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
solid 1
sheet 1
we 1
stayed 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
raft 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
itself 1
when 1
the 1
lightning 1
glared 1
out 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
big 1
straight 1
river 1
ahead 1
and 1
high 1
rocky 1
bluffs 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
says 1
i 1
hel_lo_ 1
jim 1
looky 1
yonder 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
steamboat 1
that 1
had 1
killed 1
herself 1
on 1
a 1
rock 1
we 1
was 1
drifting 1
straight 1
down 1
for 1
her 1
the 1
lightning 1
showed 1
her 1
very 1
distinct 1
she 1
was 1
leaning 1
over 1
with 1
part 1
of 1
her 1
upper 1
deck 1
above 1
water 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
every 1
little 1
chimblyguy 1
clean 1
and 1
clear 1
and 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
big 1
bell 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
slouch 1
hat 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
flashes 1
come 1
well 1
it 1
being 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
stormy 1
and 1
all 1
so 1
mysteriouslike 1
i 1
felt 1
just 1
the 1
way 1

other 1
boy 1
would 1
a 1
felt 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
wreck 1
laying 1
there 1
so 1
mournful 1
and 1
lonesome 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
aboard 1
of 1
her 1
and 1

little 1
and 1
