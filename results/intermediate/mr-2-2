the 1
turk 1
allowed 1
this 1
intimacy 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
and 1
encouraged 1
the 1
hopes 1
of 1
the 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
while 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
far 1
other 1
plans 1
he 1
loathed 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
should 1
be 1
united 1
to 1
a 1
christian 1
but 1
he 1
feared 1
the 1
resentment 1
of 1
felix 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
lukewarm 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
choose 1
to 1
betray 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
italian 1
state 1
which 1
they 1
inhabited 1
he 1
revolved 1
a 1
thousand 1
plans 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
enabled 1
to 1
prolong 1
the 1
deceit 1
until 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
necessary 1
and 1
secretly 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
daughter 1
with 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
his 1
plans 1
were 1
facilitated 1
by 1
the 1
news 1
which 1
arrived 1
from 1
paris 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
france 1
were 1
greatly 1
enraged 1
at 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
their 1
victim 1
and 1
spared 1
no 1
pains 1
to 1
detect 1
and 1
punish 1
his 1
deliverer 1
the 1
plot 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
agatha 1
were 1
thrown 1
into 1
prison 1
the 1
news 1
reached 1
felix 1
and 1
roused 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
dream 1
of 1
pleasure 1
his 1
blind 1
and 1
aged 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
gentle 1
sister 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
noisome 1
dungeon 1
while 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
free 1
air 1
and 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
her 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
this 1
idea 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
quickly 1
arranged 1
with 1
the 1
turk 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
latter 1
should 1
find 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
for 1
escape 1
before 1
felix 1
could 1
return 1
to 1
italy 1
safie 1
should 1
remain 1
as 1
a 1
boarder 1
at 1
a 1
convent 1
at 1
leghorn 1
and 1
then 1
quitting 1
the 1
lovely 1
arabian 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
paris 1
and 1
delivered 1
himself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
hoping 1
to 1
free 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
agatha 1
by 1
this 1
proceeding 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
succeed 1
they 1
remained 1
confined 1
for 1
five 1
months 1
before 1
the 1
trial 1
took 1
place 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
which 1
deprived 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
fortune 1
and 1
condemned 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
perpetual 1
exile 1
from 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
miserable 1
asylum 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
germany 1
where 1
i 1
discovered 1
them 1
felix 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
treacherous 1
turk 1
for 1
whom 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
endured 1
such 1
unheardof 1
oppression 1
on 1
discovering 1
that 1
his 1
deliverer 1
was 1
thus 1
reduced 1
to 1
poverty 1
and 1
ruin 1
became 1
a 1
traitor 1
to 1
good 1
feeling 1
and 1
honour 1
and 1
had 1
quitted 1
italy 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
insultingly 1
sending 1
felix 1
a 1
pittance 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
aid 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
some 1
plan 1
of 1
future 1
maintenance 1
such 1
were 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
preyed 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
rendered 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
endured 1
poverty 1
and 1
while 1
this 1
distress 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
meed 1
of 1
his 1
virtue 1
he 1
gloried 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
the 1
turk 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
beloved 1
safie 1
were 1
misfortunes 1
more 1
bitter 1
and 1
irreparable 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
now 1
infused 1
new 1
life 1
into 1
his 1
soul 1
when 1
the 1
news 1
reached 1
leghorn 1
that 1
felix 1
was 1
deprived 1
of 1
his 1
wealth 1
and 1
rank 1
the 1
merchant 1
commanded 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
think 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
but 1
to 1
prepare 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
her 1
native 1
country 1
the 1
generous 1
nature 1
of 1
safie 1
was 1
outraged 1
by 1
this 1
command 1
she 1
attempted 1
to 1
expostulate 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
angrily 1
reiterating 1
his 1
tyrannical 1
mandate 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
turk 1
entered 1
his 1
daughters 1
apartment 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
hastily 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
his 1
residence 1
at 1
leghorn 1
had 1
been 1
divulged 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
speedily 1
be 1
delivered 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
french 1
government 1
he 1
had 1
consequently 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
to 1
convey 1
him 1
to 1
constantinople 1
for 1
which 1
city 1
he 1
should 1
sail 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
he 1
intended 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
daughter 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
a 1
confidential 1
servant 1
to 1
follow 1
at 1
her 1
leisure 1
with 1
the 1
greater 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
property 1
which 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
arrived 1
at 1
leghorn 1
when 1
alone 1
safie 1
resolved 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
mind 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
conduct 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
become 1
her 1
to 1
pursue 1
in 1
this 1
emergency 1
a 1
residence 1
in 1
turkey 1
was 1
abhorrent 1
to 1
her 1
her 1
religion 1
and 1
her 1
feelings 1
were 1
alike 1
averse 1
to 1
it 1
by 1
some 1
papers 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
which 1
fell 1
into 1
her 1
hands 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
exile 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
and 1
learnt 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
then 1
resided 1
she 1
hesitated 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
formed 1
her 1
determination 1
taking 1
with 1
her 1
some 1
jewels 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
she 1
quitted 1
italy 1
with 1
an 1
attendant 1
a 1
native 1
of 1
leghorn 1
but 1
who 1
understood 1
the 1
common 1
language 1
of 1
turkey 1
and 1
departed 1
for 1
germany 1
she 1
arrived 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
a 1
town 1
about 1
twenty 1
leagues 1
from 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
when 1
her 1
attendant 1
fell 1
dangerously 1
ill 1
safie 1
nursed 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
devoted 1
affection 1
but 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
died 1
and 1
the 1
arabian 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
utterly 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
customs 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
fell 1
however 1
into 1
good 1
hands 1
the 1
italian 1
had 1
mentioned 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
bound 1
and 1
after 1
her 1
death 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
took 1
care 1
that 1
safie 1
should 1
arrive 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
chapter 1
15 1
such 1
was 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cottagers 1
it 1
impressed 1
me 1
deeply 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
views 1
of 1
social 1
life 1
which 1
it 1
developed 1
to 1
admire 1
their 1
virtues 1
and 1
to 1
deprecate 1
the 1
vices 1
of 1
mankind 1
as 1
yet 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
crime 1
as 1
a 1
distant 1
evil 1
benevolence 1
and 1
generosity 1
were 1
ever 1
present 1
before 1
me 1
inciting 1
within 1
me 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
become 1
an 1
actor 1
in 1
the 1
busy 1
scene 1
where 1
so 1
many 1
admirable 1
qualities 1
were 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
displayed 1
but 1
in 1
giving 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
intellect 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
omit 1
a 1
circumstance 1
which 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
august 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
year 1
one 1
night 1
during 1
my 1
accustomed 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
where 1
i 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
i 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
leathern 1
portmanteau 1
containing 1
several 1
articles 1
of 1
dress 1
and 1
some 1
books 1
i 1
eagerly 1
seized 1
the 1
prize 1
and 1
returned 1
with 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
hovel 1
fortunately 1
the 1
books 1
were 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
the 1
elements 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
acquired 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
consisted 1
of 1
paradise 1
lost 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
plutarchs 1
lives 1
and 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
these 1
treasures 1
gave 1
me 1
extreme 1
delight 1
i 1
now 1
continually 1
studied 1
and 1
exercised 1
my 1
mind 1
upon 1
these 1
histories 1
whilst 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
their 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
these 1
books 1
they 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
an 1
infinity 1
of 1
new 1
images 1
and 1
feelings 1
that 1
sometimes 1
raised 1
me 1
to 1
ecstasy 1
but 1
more 1
frequently 1
sunk 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
lowest 1
dejection 1
in 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
besides 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
its 1
simple 1
and 1
affecting 1
story 1
so 1
many 1
opinions 1
are 1
canvassed 1
and 1
so 1
many 1
lights 1
thrown 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
obscure 1
subjects 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
in 1
it 1
a 1
neverending 1
source 1
of 1
speculation 1
and 1
astonishment 1
the 1
gentle 1
and 1
domestic 1
manners 1
it 1
described 1
combined 1
with 1
lofty 1
sentiments 1
and 1
feelings 1
which 1
had 1
for 1
their 1
object 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
self 1
accorded 1
well 1
with 1
my 1
experience 1
among 1
my 1
protectors 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
wants 1
which 1
were 1
forever 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
bosom 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
werter 1
himself 1
a 1
more 1
divine 1
being 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
beheld 1
or 1
imagined 1
his 1
character 1
contained 1
no 1
pretension 1
but 1
it 1
sank 1
deep 1
the 1
disquisitions 1
upon 1
death 1
and 1
suicide 1
were 1
calculated 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
pretend 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
the 1
merits 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
yet 1
i 1
inclined 1
towards 1
the 1
opinions 1
of 1
the 1
hero 1
whose 1
extinction 1
i 1
wept 1
without 1
precisely 1
understanding 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
however 1
i 1
applied 1
much 1
personally 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
feelings 1
and 1
condition 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
similar 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
strangely 1
unlike 1
to 1
the 1
beings 1
concerning 1
whom 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
to 1
whose 1
conversation 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
listener 1
i 1
sympathized 1
with 1
and 1
partly 1
understood 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unformed 1
in 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
dependent 1
on 1
none 1
and 1
related 1
to 1
none 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
to 1
lament 1
my 1
annihilation 1
my 1
person 1
was 1
hideous 1
and 1
my 1
stature 1
gigantic 1
what 1
did 1
this 1
mean 1
who 1
was 1
i 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
whence 1
did 1
i 1
come 1
what 1
was 1
my 1
destination 1
these 1
questions 1
continually 1
recurred 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
them 1
the 1
volume 1
of 1
plutarchs 1
lives 1
which 1
i 1
possessed 1
contained 1
the 1
histories 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
founders 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
republics 1
this 1
book 1
had 1
a 1
far 1
different 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
werters 1
imaginations 1
despondency 1
and 1
gloom 1
but 1
plutarch 1
taught 1
me 1
high 1
thoughts 1
he 1
elevated 1
me 1
above 1
the 1
wretched 1
sphere 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
reflections 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
past 1
ages 1
many 1
things 1
i 1
read 1
surpassed 1
my 1
understanding 1
and 1
experience 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
confused 1
knowledge 1
of 1
kingdoms 1
wide 1
extents 1
of 1
country 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
and 1
boundless 1
seas 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
perfectly 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
towns 1
and 1
large 1
assemblages 1
of 1
men 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
only 1
school 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
studied 1
human 1
nature 1
but 1
this 1
book 1
developed 1
new 1
and 1
mightier 1
scenes 1
of 1
action 1
i 1
read 1
of 1
men 1
concerned 1
in 1
public 1
affairs 1
governing 1
or 1
massacring 1
their 1
species 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
ardour 1
for 1
virtue 1
rise 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
vice 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
those 1
terms 1
relative 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
i 1
applied 1
them 1
to 1
pleasure 1
and 1
pain 1
alone 1
induced 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
i 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
led 1
to 1
admire 1
peaceable 1
lawgivers 1
numa 1
solon 1
and 1
lycurgus 1
in 1
preference 1
to 1
romulus 1
and 1
theseus 1
the 1
patriarchal 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
caused 1
these 1
impressions 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
firm 1
hold 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
perhaps 1
if 1
my 1
first 1
introduction 1
to 1
humanity 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
soldier 1
burning 1
for 1
glory 1
and 1
slaughter 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
different 1
sensations 1
but 1
paradise 1
lost 1
excited 1
different 1
and 1
far 1
deeper 1
emotions 1
i 1
read 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
the 1
other 1
volumes 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
as 1
a 1
true 1
history 1
it 1
moved 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
awe 1
that 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
an 1
omnipotent 1
god 1
warring 1
with 1
his 1
creatures 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
exciting 1
i 1
often 1
referred 1
the 1
several 1
situations 1
as 1
their 1
similarity 1
struck 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
like 1
adam 1
i 1
was 1
apparently 1
united 1
by 1
no 1
link 1
to 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
in 1
existence 1
but 1
his 1
state 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
mine 1
in 1
every 1
other 1
respect 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
god 1
a 1
perfect 1
creature 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
guarded 1
by 1
the 1
especial 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
creator 1
he 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
with 1
and 1
acquire 1
knowledge 1
from 1
beings 1
of 1
a 1
superior 1
nature 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
wretched 1
helpless 1
and 1
alone 1
many 1
times 1
i 1
considered 1
satan 1
as 1
the 1
fitter 1
emblem 1
of 1
my 1
condition 1
for 1
often 1
like 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
viewed 1
the 1
bliss 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
the 1
bitter 1
gall 1
of 1
envy 1
rose 1
within 1
me 1
another 1
circumstance 1
strengthened 1
and 1
confirmed 1
these 1
feelings 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
i 1
discovered 1
some 1
papers 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
of 1
the 1
dress 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
from 1
your 1
laboratory 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
had 1
neglected 1
them 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
decipher 1
the 1
characters 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
written 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
study 1
them 1
with 1
diligence 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
journal 1
of 1
the 1
four 1
months 1
that 1
preceded 1
my 1
creation 1
you 1
minutely 1
described 1
in 1
these 1
papers 1
every 1
step 1
you 1
took 1
in 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
your 1
work 1
this 1
history 1
was 1
mingled 1
with 1
accounts 1
of 1
domestic 1
occurrences 1
you 1
doubtless 1
recollect 1
these 1
papers 1
here 1
they 1
are 1
everything 1
is 1
related 1
in 1
them 1
which 1
bears 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
accursed 1
origin 1
the 1
whole 1
detail 1
of 1
that 1
series 1
of 1
disgusting 1
circumstances 1
which 1
produced 1
it 1
is 1
set 1
in 1
view 1
the 1
minutest 1
description 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
and 1
loathsome 1
person 1
is 1
given 1
in 1
language 1
which 1
painted 1
your 1
own 1
horrors 1
and 1
rendered 1
mine 1
indelible 1
i 1
sickened 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
hateful 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
received 1
life 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
agony 1
accursed 1
creator 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
form 1
a 1
monster 1
so 1
hideous 1
that 1
even 1
you 1
turned 1
from 1
me 1
in 1
disgust 1
god 1
in 1
pity 1
made 1
man 1
beautiful 1
and 1
alluring 1
after 1
his 1
own 1
image 1
but 1
my 1
form 1
is 1
a 1
filthy 1
type 1
of 1
yours 1
more 1
horrid 1
even 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
resemblance 1
satan 1
had 1
his 1
companions 1
fellow 1
devils 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
encourage 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
solitary 1
and 1
abhorred 1
these 1
were 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
my 1
hours 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
solitude 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
contemplated 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
their 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
dispositions 1
i 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
admiration 1
of 1
their 1
virtues 1
they 1
would 1
compassionate 1
me 1
and 1
overlook 1
my 1
personal 1
deformity 1
could 1
they 1
turn 1
from 1
their 1
door 1
one 1
however 1
monstrous 1
who 1
solicited 1
their 1
compassion 1
and 1
friendship 1
i 1
resolved 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
to 1
despair 1
but 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
to 1
fit 1
myself 1
for 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
postponed 1
this 1
attempt 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
longer 1
for 1
the 1
importance 1
attached 1
to 1
its 1
success 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
dread 1
lest 1
i 1
should 1
fail 1
besides 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
my 1
understanding 1
improved 1
so 1
much 1
with 1
every 1
days 1
experience 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
undertaking 1
until 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
months 1
should 1
have 1
added 1
to 1
my 1
sagacity 1
several 1
changes 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
took 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
safie 1
diffused 1
happiness 1
among 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
i 1
also 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
plenty 1
reigned 1
there 1
felix 1
and 1
agatha 1
spent 1
more 1
time 1
in 1
amusement 1
and 1
conversation 1
and 1
were 1
assisted 1
in 1
their 1
labours 1
by 1
servants 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
rich 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
contented 1
and 1
happy 1
their 1
feelings 1
were 1
serene 1
and 1
peaceful 1
while 1
mine 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
tumultuous 1
increase 1
of 1
knowledge 1
only 1
discovered 1
to 1
me 1
more 1
clearly 1
what 1
a 1
wretched 1
outcast 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
cherished 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
it 1
vanished 1
when 1
i 1
beheld 1
my 1
person 1
reflected 1
in 1
water 1
or 1
my 1
shadow 1
in 1
the 1
moonshine 1
even 1
as 1
that 1
frail 1
image 1
and 1
that 1
inconstant 1
shade 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
crush 1
these 1
fears 1
and 1
to 1
fortify 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
trial 1
which 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
undergo 1
and 1
sometimes 1
i 1
allowed 1
my 1
thoughts 1
unchecked 1
by 1
reason 1
to 1
ramble 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
of 1
paradise 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
fancy 1
amiable 1
and 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
sympathizing 1
with 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
cheering 1
my 1
gloom 1
their 1
angelic 1
countenances 1
breathed 1
smiles 1
of 1
consolation 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
dream 1
no 1
eve 1
soothed 1
my 1
sorrows 1
nor 1
shared 1
my 1
thoughts 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
i 1
remembered 1
adams 1
supplication 1
to 1
his 1
creator 1
but 1
where 1
was 1
mine 1
he 1
had 1
abandoned 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
cursed 1
him 1
autumn 1
passed 1
thus 1
i 1
saw 1
with 1
surprise 1
and 1
grief 1
the 1
leaves 1
decay 1
and 1
fall 1
and 1
nature 1
again 1
assume 1
the 1
barren 1
and 1
bleak 1
appearance 1
it 1
had 1
worn 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
beheld 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
moon 1
yet 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
heed 1
the 1
bleakness 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
i 1
was 1
better 1
fitted 1
by 1
my 1
conformation 1
for 1
the 1
endurance 1
of 1
cold 1
than 1
heat 1
but 1
my 1
chief 1
delights 1
were 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
gay 1
apparel 1
of 1
summer 1
when 1
those 1
deserted 1
me 1
i 1
turned 1
with 1
more 1
attention 1
towards 1
the 1
cottagers 1
their 1
happiness 1
was 1
not 1
decreased 1
by 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
summer 1
they 1
loved 1
and 1
sympathized 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
their 1
joys 1
depending 1
on 1
each 1
other 1
were 1
not 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
casualties 1
that 1
took 1
place 1
around 1
them 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
saw 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
greater 1
became 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
protection 1
and 1
kindness 1
my 1
heart 1
yearned 1
to 1
be 1
known 1
and 1
loved 1
by 1
these 1
amiable 1
creatures 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
sweet 1
looks 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
affection 1
was 1
the 1
utmost 1
limit 1
of 1
my 1
ambition 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
turn 1
them 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
horror 1
the 1
poor 1
that 1
stopped 1
at 1
their 1
door 1
were 1
never 1
driven 1
away 1
i 1
asked 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
for 1
greater 1
treasures 1
than 1
a 1
little 1
food 1
or 1
rest 1
i 1
required 1
kindness 1
and 1
sympathy 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
myself 1
utterly 1
unworthy 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
winter 1
advanced 1
and 1
an 1
entire 1
revolution 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
i 1
awoke 1
into 1
life 1
my 1
attention 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
was 1
solely 1
directed 1
towards 1
my 1
plan 1
of 1
introducing 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
i 1
revolved 1
many 1
projects 1
but 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
finally 1
fixed 1
was 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
dwelling 1
when 1
the 1
blind 1
old 1
man 1
should 1
be 1
alone 1
i 1
had 1
sagacity 1
enough 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
the 1
unnatural 1
hideousness 1
of 1
my 1
person 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
object 1
of 1
horror 1
with 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
beheld 1
me 1
my 1
voice 1
although 1
harsh 1
had 1
nothing 1
terrible 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
thought 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
in 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
i 1
could 1
gain 1
the 1
good 1
will 1
and 1
mediation 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
de 1
lacey 1
i 1
might 1
by 1
his 1
means 1
be 1
tolerated 1
by 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
red 1
leaves 1
that 1
strewed 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
diffused 1
cheerfulness 1
although 1
it 1
denied 1
warmth 1
safie 1
agatha 1
and 1
felix 1
departed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
country 1
walk 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
desire 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
when 1
his 1
children 1
had 1
departed 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
played 1
several 1
mournful 1
but 1
sweet 1
airs 1
more 1
sweet 1
and 1
mournful 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
him 1
play 1
before 1
at 1
first 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
illuminated 1
with 1
pleasure 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
continued 1
thoughtfulness 1
and 1
sadness 1
succeeded 1
at 1
length 1
laying 1
aside 1
the 1
instrument 1
he 1
sat 1
absorbed 1
in 1
reflection 1
my 1
heart 1
beat 1
quick 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
hour 1
and 1
moment 1
of 1
trial 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
hopes 1
or 1
realize 1
my 1
fears 1
the 1
servants 1
were 1
gone 1
to 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
fair 1
all 1
was 1
silent 1
in 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
opportunity 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
proceeded 1
to 1
execute 1
my 1
plan 1
my 1
limbs 1
failed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
again 1
i 1
rose 1
and 1
exerting 1
all 1
the 1
firmness 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
master 1
removed 1
the 1
planks 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
to 1
conceal 1
my 1
retreat 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
with 1
renewed 1
determination 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
their 1
cottage 1
i 1
knocked 1
who 1
is 1
there 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
come 1
in 1
i 1
entered 1
pardon 1
this 1
intrusion 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
traveller 1
in 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
rest 1
you 1
would 1
greatly 1
oblige 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
enter 1
said 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
i 1
can 1
to 1
relieve 1
your 1
wants 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
my 1
children 1
are 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
blind 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
shall 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
procure 1
food 1
for 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
trouble 1
yourself 1
my 1
kind 1
host 1
i 1
have 1
food 1
it 1
is 1
warmth 1
and 1
rest 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
need 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
a 1
silence 1
ensued 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
every 1
minute 1
was 1
precious 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
i 1
remained 1
irresolute 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
interview 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
addressed 1
me 1
by 1
your 1
language 1
stranger 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
countryman 1
are 1
you 1
french 1
no 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
a 1
french 1
family 1
and 1
understand 1
that 1
language 1
only 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
going 1
to 1
claim 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
some 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
sincerely 1
love 1
and 1
of 1
whose 1
favour 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
hopes 1
are 1
they 1
germans 1
no 1
they 1
are 1
french 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
change 1
the 1
subject 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
deserted 1
creature 1
i 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
relation 1
or 1
friend 1
upon 1
earth 1
these 1
amiable 1
people 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
go 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
me 1
and 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
full 1
of 1
fears 1
for 1
if 1
i 1
fail 1
there 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
outcast 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
forever 1
do 1
not 1
despair 1
to 1
be 1
friendless 1
is 1
indeed 1
to 1
be 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
men 1
when 1
unprejudiced 1
by 1
any 1
obvious 1
selfinterest 1
are 1
full 1
of 1
brotherly 1
love 1
and 1
charity 1
rely 1
therefore 1
on 1
your 1
hopes 1
and 1
if 1
these 1
friends 1
are 1
good 1
and 1
amiable 1
do 1
not 1
despair 1
they 1
are 1
kindthey 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
they 1
are 1
prejudiced 1
against 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
good 1
dispositions 1
my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
hitherto 1
harmless 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
beneficial 1
but 1
a 1
fatal 1
prejudice 1
clouds 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
ought 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
kind 1
friend 1
they 1
behold 1
only 1
a 1
detestable 1
monster 1
that 1
is 1
indeed 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
blameless 1
cannot 1
you 1
undeceive 1
them 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
undertake 1
that 1
task 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
i 1
feel 1
so 1
many 1
overwhelming 1
terrors 1
i 1
tenderly 1
love 1
these 1
friends 1
i 1
have 1
unknown 1
to 1
them 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
habits 1
of 1
daily 1
kindness 1
towards 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
injure 1
them 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
prejudice 1
which 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
overcome 1
where 1
do 1
these 1
friends 1
reside 1
near 1
this 1
spot 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
paused 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
unreservedly 1
confide 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
your 1
tale 1
i 1
perhaps 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
in 1
undeceiving 1
them 1
i 1
am 1
blind 1
and 1
cannot 1
judge 1
of 1
your 1
countenance 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
your 1
words 1
which 1
persuades 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
sincere 1
i 1
am 1
poor 1
and 1
an 1
exile 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
afford 1
me 1
true 1
pleasure 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
serviceable 1
to 1
a 1
human 1
creature 1
excellent 1
man 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
accept 1
your 1
generous 1
offer 1
you 1
raise 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dust 1
by 1
this 1
kindness 1
and 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
by 1
your 1
aid 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
driven 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
heaven 1
forbid 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
really 1
criminal 1
for 1
that 1
can 1
only 1
drive 1
you 1
to 1
desperation 1
and 1
not 1
instigate 1
you 1
to 1
virtue 1
i 1
also 1
am 1
unfortunate 1
i 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
condemned 1
although 1
innocent 1
judge 1
therefore 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
for 1
your 1
misfortunes 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
my 1
best 1
and 1
only 1
benefactor 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
first 1
have 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
kindness 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
forever 1
grateful 1
and 1
your 1
present 1
humanity 1
assures 1
me 1
of 1
success 1
with 1
those 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
am 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
meeting 1
may 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
and 1
residence 1
of 1
those 1
friends 1
i 1
paused 1
this 1
i 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
decision 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
or 1
bestow 1
happiness 1
on 1
me 1
forever 1
i 1
struggled 1
vainly 1
for 1
firmness 1
sufficient 1
to 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
effort 1
destroyed 1
all 1
my 1
remaining 1
strength 1
i 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
chair 1
and 1
sobbed 1
aloud 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
but 1
seizing 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
cried 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
save 1
and 1
protect 1
me 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
are 1
the 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
seek 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
desert 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
trial 1
great 1
god 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
the 1
cottage 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
felix 1
safie 1
and 1
agatha 1
entered 1
who 1
can 1
describe 1
their 1
horror 1
and 1
consternation 1
on 1
beholding 1
me 1
agatha 1
fainted 1
and 1
safie 1
unable 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
her 1
friend 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
felix 1
darted 1
forward 1
and 1
with 1
supernatural 1
force 1
tore 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
whose 1
knees 1
i 1
clung 1
in 1
a 1
transport 1
of 1
fury 1
he 1
dashed 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
struck 1
me 1
violently 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
torn 1
him 1
limb 1
from 1
limb 1
as 1
the 1
lion 1
rends 1
the 1
antelope 1
but 1
my 1
heart 1
sank 1
within 1
me 1
as 1
with 1
bitter 1
sickness 1
and 1
i 1
refrained 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
repeating 1
his 1
blow 1
when 1
overcome 1
by 1
pain 1
and 1
anguish 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
tumult 1
escaped 1
unperceived 1
to 1
my 1
hovel 1
chapter 1
16 1
cursed 1
cursed 1
creator 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
live 1
why 1
in 1
that 1
instant 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
of 1
existence 1
which 1
you 1
had 1
so 1
wantonly 1
bestowed 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
despair 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
me 1
my 1
feelings 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
revenge 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
pleasure 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
have 1
glutted 1
myself 1
with 1
their 1
shrieks 1
and 1
misery 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
i 1
quitted 1
my 1
retreat 1
and 1
wandered 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
now 1
no 1
longer 1
restrained 1
by 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
discovery 1
i 1
gave 1
vent 1
to 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
fearful 1
howlings 1
i 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
that 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
toils 1
destroying 1
the 1
objects 1
that 1
obstructed 1
me 1
and 1
ranging 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
with 1
a 1
staglike 1
swiftness 1
oh 1
what 1
a 1
miserable 1
night 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
cold 1
stars 1
shone 1
in 1
mockery 1
and 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
waved 1
their 1
branches 1
above 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
sweet 1
voice 1
of 1
a 1
bird 1
burst 1
forth 1
amidst 1
the 1
universal 1
stillness 1
all 1
save 1
i 1
were 1
at 1
rest 1
or 1
in 1
enjoyment 1
i 1
like 1
the 1
archfiend 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
finding 1
myself 1
unsympathized 1
with 1
wished 1
to 1
tear 1
up 1
the 1
trees 1
spread 1
havoc 1
and 1
destruction 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
have 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
ruin 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
luxury 1
of 1
sensation 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
i 1
became 1
fatigued 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
bodily 1
exertion 1
and 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
damp 1
grass 1
in 1
the 1
sick 1
impotence 1
of 1
despair 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
among 1
the 1
myriads 1
of 1
men 1
that 1
existed 1
who 1
would 1
pity 1
or 1
assist 1
me 1
and 1
should 1
i 1
feel 1
kindness 1
towards 1
my 1
enemies 1
no 1
from 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
declared 1
everlasting 1
war 1
against 1
the 1
species 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
against 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
formed 1
me 1
and 1
sent 1
me 1
forth 1
to 1
this 1
insupportable 1
misery 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
retreat 1
during 1
that 1
day 1
accordingly 1
i 1
hid 1
myself 1
in 1
some 1
thick 1
underwood 1
determining 1
to 1
devote 1
the 1
ensuing 1
hours 1
to 1
reflection 1
on 1
my 1
situation 1
the 1
pleasant 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
pure 1
air 1
of 1
day 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
considered 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
believing 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
hasty 1
in 1
my 1
conclusions 1
i 1
had 1
certainly 1
acted 1
imprudently 1
it 1
was 1
apparent 1
that 1
my 1
conversation 1
had 1
interested 1
the 1
father 1
in 1
my 1
behalf 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
fool 1
in 1
having 1
exposed 1
my 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
familiarized 1
the 1
old 1
de 1
lacey 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
to 1
have 1
discovered 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
approach 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
my 1
errors 1
to 1
be 1
irretrievable 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
consideration 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
seek 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
win 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
party 1
these 1
thoughts 1
calmed 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
i 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
profound 1
sleep 1
but 1
the 1
fever 1
of 1
my 1
blood 1
did 1
not 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
visited 1
by 1
peaceful 1
dreams 1
the 1
horrible 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
day 1
was 1
forever 1
acting 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
females 1
were 1
flying 1
and 1
the 1
enraged 1
felix 1
tearing 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
fathers 1
feet 1
i 1
awoke 1
exhausted 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
night 1
i 1
crept 1
forth 1
from 1
my 1
hidingplace 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
food 1
when 1
my 1
hunger 1
was 1
appeased 1
i 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
wellknown 1
path 1
that 1
conducted 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
i 1
crept 1
into 1
my 1
hovel 1
and 1
remained 1
in 1
silent 1
expectation 1
of 1
the 1
accustomed 1
hour 1
when 1
the 1
family 1
arose 1
that 1
hour 1
passed 1
the 1
sun 1
mounted 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
but 1
the 1
cottagers 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
i 1
trembled 1
violently 1
apprehending 1
some 1
dreadful 1
misfortune 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
dark 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
no 1
motion 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
this 1
suspense 1
presently 1
two 1
countrymen 1
passed 1
by 1
but 1
pausing 1
near 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
entered 1
into 1
conversation 1
using 1
violent 1
gesticulations 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
as 1
they 1
spoke 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
differed 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
soon 1
after 1
however 1
felix 1
approached 1
with 1
another 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
surprised 1
as 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1
that 1
morning 1
and 1
waited 1
anxiously 1
to 1
discover 1
from 1
his 1
discourse 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
these 1
unusual 1
appearances 1
do 1
you 1
consider 1
said 1
his 1
companion 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
obliged 1
to 1
pay 1
three 1
months 1
rent 1
and 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
produce 1
of 1
your 1
garden 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
take 1
any 1
unfair 1
advantage 1
and 1
i 1
beg 1
therefore 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
days 1
to 1
consider 1
of 1
your 1
determination 1
it 1
is 1
utterly 1
useless 1
replied 1
felix 1
we 1
can 1
never 1
again 1
inhabit 1
your 1
cottage 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
owing 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful 1
circumstance 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
related 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
will 1
never 1
recover 1
from 1
their 1
horror 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
take 1
possession 1
of 1
your 1
tenement 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
fly 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
felix 1
trembled 1
violently 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
remained 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
departed 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
more 1
i 1
continued 1
for 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
and 1
stupid 1
despair 1
my 1
protectors 1
had 1
departed 1
and 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
only 1
link 1
that 1
held 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
revenge 1
and 1
hatred 1
filled 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
strive 1
to 1
control 1
them 1
but 1
allowing 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
bent 1
my 1
mind 1
towards 1
injury 1
and 1
death 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
mild 1
voice 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
the 1
gentle 1
eyes 1
of 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
these 1
thoughts 1
vanished 1
and 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
tears 1
somewhat 1
soothed 1
me 1
but 1
again 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
spurned 1
and 1
deserted 1
me 1
anger 1
returned 1
a 1
rage 1
of 1
anger 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
injure 1
anything 1
human 1
i 1
turned 1
my 1
fury 1
towards 1
inanimate 1
objects 1
as 1
night 1
advanced 1
i 1
placed 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
combustibles 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
destroyed 1
every 1
vestige 1
of 1
cultivation 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
i 1
waited 1
with 1
forced 1
impatience 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
sunk 1
to 1
commence 1
my 1
operations 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
advanced 1
a 1
fierce 1
wind 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
quickly 1
dispersed 1
the 1
clouds 1
that 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
blast 1
tore 1
along 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
avalanche 1
and 1
produced 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
insanity 1
in 1
my 1
spirits 1
that 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
reason 1
and 1
reflection 1
i 1
lighted 1
the 1
dry 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
fury 1
around 1
the 1
devoted 1
cottage 1
my 1
eyes 1
still 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
western 1
horizon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
moon 1
nearly 1
touched 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
orb 1
was 1
at 1
length 1
hid 1
and 1
i 1
waved 1
my 1
brand 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
i 1
fired 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
heath 1
and 1
bushes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
the 1
wind 1
fanned 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
quickly 1
enveloped 1
by 1
the 1
flames 1
which 1
clung 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
licked 1
it 1
with 1
their 1
forked 1
and 1
destroying 1
tongues 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
no 1
assistance 1
could 1
save 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
habitation 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
scene 1
and 1
sought 1
for 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
now 1
with 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
me 1
whither 1
should 1
i 1
bend 1
my 1
steps 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
fly 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
hated 1
and 1
despised 1
every 1
country 1
must 1
be 1
equally 1
horrible 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
your 1
papers 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
creator 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
could 1
i 1
apply 1
with 1
more 1
fitness 1
than 1
to 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
life 1
among 1
the 1
lessons 1
that 1
felix 1
had 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
safie 1
geography 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
omitted 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
these 1
the 1
relative 1
situations 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
countries 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
you 1
had 1
mentioned 1
geneva 1
as 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
your 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
towards 1
this 1
place 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
proceed 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
i 1
to 1
direct 1
myself 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
travel 1
in 1
a 1
southwesterly 1
direction 1
to 1
reach 1
my 1
destination 1
but 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
guide 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
towns 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
ask 1
information 1
from 1
a 1
single 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
despair 1
from 1
you 1
only 1
could 1
i 1
hope 1
for 1
succour 1
although 1
towards 1
you 1
i 1
felt 1
no 1
sentiment 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
hatred 1
unfeeling 1
heartless 1
creator 1
you 1
had 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
perceptions 1
and 1
passions 1
and 1
then 1
cast 1
me 1
abroad 1
an 1
object 1
for 1
the 1
scorn 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
mankind 1
but 1
on 1
you 1
only 1
had 1
i 1
any 1
claim 1
for 1
pity 1
and 1
redress 1
and 1
from 1
you 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
seek 1
that 1
justice 1
which 1
i 1
vainly 1
attempted 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
that 1
wore 1
the 1
human 1
form 1
my 1
travels 1
were 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
sufferings 1
i 1
endured 1
intense 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
autumn 1
when 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
district 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
resided 1
i 1
travelled 1
only 1
at 1
night 1
fearful 1
of 1
encountering 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
nature 1
decayed 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
heatless 1
rain 1
and 1
snow 1
poured 1
around 1
me 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
were 1
frozen 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
hard 1
and 1
chill 1
and 1
bare 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
no 1
shelter 1
oh 1
earth 1
how 1
often 1
did 1
i 1
imprecate 1
curses 1
on 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
the 1
mildness 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
had 1
fled 1
and 1
all 1
within 1
me 1
was 1
turned 1
to 1
gall 1
and 1
bitterness 1
the 1
nearer 1
i 1
approached 1
to 1
your 1
habitation 1
the 1
more 1
deeply 1
did 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
revenge 1
enkindled 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
snow 1
fell 1
and 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
hardened 1
but 1
i 1
rested 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
incidents 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
directed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
i 1
often 1
wandered 1
wide 1
from 1
my 1
path 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
allowed 1
me 1
no 1
respite 1
no 1
incident 1
occurred 1
from 1
which 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
misery 1
could 1
not 1
extract 1
its 1
food 1
but 1
a 1
circumstance 1
that 1
happened 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
on 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
switzerland 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
recovered 1
its 1
warmth 1
and 1
the 1
earth 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
green 1
confirmed 1
in 1
an 1
especial 1
manner 1
the 1
bitterness 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
i 1
generally 1
rested 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
travelled 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
secured 1
by 1
night 1
from 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
man 1
one 1
morning 1
however 1
finding 1
that 1
my 1
path 1
lay 1
through 1
a 1
deep 1
wood 1
i 1
ventured 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
after 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
risen 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
spring 1
cheered 1
even 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
its 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
balminess 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
gentleness 1
and 1
pleasure 1
that 1
had 1
long 1
appeared 1
dead 1
revive 1
within 1
me 1
half 1
surprised 1
by 1
the 1
novelty 1
of 1
these 1
sensations 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
them 1
and 1
forgetting 1
my 1
solitude 1
and 1
deformity 1
dared 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
soft 1
tears 1
again 1
bedewed 1
my 1
cheeks 1
and 1
i 1
even 1
raised 1
my 1
humid 1
eyes 1
with 1
thankfulness 1
towards 1
the 1
blessed 1
sun 1
which 1
bestowed 1
such 1
joy 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
wind 1
among 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
its 1
boundary 1
which 1
was 1
skirted 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
rapid 1
river 1
into 1
which 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
bent 1
their 1
branches 1
now 1
budding 1
with 1
the 1
fresh 1
spring 1
here 1
i 1
paused 1
not 1
exactly 1
knowing 1
what 1
path 1
to 1
pursue 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
that 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
conceal 1
myself 1
under 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
a 1
cypress 1
i 1
was 1
scarcely 1
hid 1
when 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
came 1
running 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
concealed 1
laughing 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
someone 1
in 1
sport 1
she 1
continued 1
her 1
course 1
along 1
the 1
precipitous 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
when 1
suddenly 1
her 1
foot 1
slipped 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
rapid 1
stream 1
i 1
rushed 1
from 1
my 1
hidingplace 1
and 1
with 1
extreme 1
labour 1
from 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
saved 1
her 1
and 1
dragged 1
her 1
to 1
shore 1
she 1
was 1
senseless 1
and 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
every 1
means 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
animation 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
rustic 1
who 1
was 1
probably 1
the 1
person 1
from 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
playfully 1
fled 1
on 1
seeing 1
me 1
he 1
darted 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
my 1
arms 1
hastened 1
towards 1
the 1
deeper 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
i 1
followed 1
speedily 1
i 1
hardly 1
knew 1
why 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
saw 1
me 1
draw 1
near 1
he 1
aimed 1
a 1
gun 1
which 1
he 1
carried 1
at 1
my 1
body 1
and 1
fired 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
my 1
injurer 1
with 1
increased 1
swiftness 1
escaped 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
this 1
was 1
then 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
benevolence 1
i 1
had 1
saved 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
from 1
destruction 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
recompense 1
i 1
now 1
writhed 1
under 1
the 1
miserable 1
pain 1
of 1
a 1
wound 1
which 1
shattered 1
the 1
flesh 1
and 1
bone 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
gentleness 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
entertained 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
before 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
hellish 1
rage 1
and 1
gnashing 1
of 1
teeth 1
inflamed 1
by 1
pain 1
i 1
vowed 1
eternal 1
hatred 1
and 1
vengeance 1
to 1
all 1
mankind 1
but 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
wound 1
overcame 1
me 1
my 1
pulses 1
paused 1
and 1
i 1
fainted 1
for 1
some 1
weeks 1
i 1
led 1
a 1
miserable 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
wound 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
ball 1
had 1
entered 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
remained 1
there 1
or 1
passed 1
through 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
extracting 1
it 1
my 1
sufferings 1
were 1
augmented 1
also 1
by 1
the 1
oppressive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
injustice 1
and 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
their 1
infliction 1
my 1
daily 1
vows 1
rose 1
for 1
revengea 1
deep 1
and 1
deadly 1
revenge 1
such 1
as 1
would 1
alone 1
compensate 1
for 1
the 1
outrages 1
and 1
anguish 1
i 1
had 1
endured 1
after 1
some 1
weeks 1
my 1
wound 1
healed 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
the 1
labours 1
i 1
endured 1
were 1
no 1
longer 1
to 1
be 1
alleviated 1
by 1
the 1
bright 1
sun 1
or 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
spring 1
all 1
joy 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
mockery 1
which 1
insulted 1
my 1
desolate 1
state 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
more 1
painfully 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
enjoyment 1
of 1
pleasure 1
but 1
my 1
toils 1
now 1
drew 1
near 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
reached 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
geneva 1
it 1
was 1
evening 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
and 1
i 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
hidingplace 1
among 1
the 1
fields 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
to 1
meditate 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
i 1
should 1
apply 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
far 1
too 1
unhappy 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
evening 1
or 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
setting 1
behind 1
the 1
stupendous 1
mountains 1
of 1
jura 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
slight 1
sleep 1
relieved 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
reflection 1
which 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
beautiful 1
child 1
who 1
came 1
running 1
into 1
the 1
recess 1
i 1
had 1
chosen 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
sportiveness 1
of 1
infancy 1
suddenly 1
as 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
an 1
idea 1
seized 1
me 1
that 1
this 1
little 1
creature 1
was 1
unprejudiced 1
and 1
had 1
lived 1
too 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
to 1
have 1
imbibed 1
a 1
horror 1
of 1
deformity 1
if 1
therefore 1
i 1
could 1
seize 1
him 1
and 1
educate 1
him 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
and 1
friend 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
desolate 1
in 1
this 1
peopled 1
earth 1
urged 1
by 1
this 1
impulse 1
i 1
seized 1
on 1
the 1
boy 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
and 1
drew 1
him 1
towards 1
me 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
beheld 1
my 1
form 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
i 1
drew 1
his 1
hand 1
forcibly 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
said 1
child 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
hurt 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
struggled 1
violently 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
he 1
cried 1
monster 1
ugly 1
wretch 1

wish 1
to 1
eat 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1

are 1
an 1
ogre 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
or 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
my 1
papa 1

will 1
never 1
see 1
your 1
father 1
again 1

must 1
come 1
with 1

monster 1
let 1
me 1
go 1

towards 1

have 1
sworn 1
eternal 1
revenge 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
first 1
victim 1
the 1
child 1
still 1
struggled 1
and 1
loaded 1
me 1
with 1
epithets 1
which 1
carried 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
grasped 1
his 1
throat 1
to 1
silence 1
him 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
lay 1
dead 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
victim 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
swelled 1
with 1
exultation 1
and 1
hellish 1
triumph 1
clapping 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
i 1
too 1
can 1
create 1
desolation 1
my 1
enemy 1
is 1
not 1
invulnerable 1
this 1
death 1
will 1
carry 1
despair 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
other 1
miseries 1
shall 1
torment 1
and 1
destroy 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
child 1
i 1
saw 1
something 1
glittering 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
lovely 1
woman 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
my 1
malignity 1
it 1
softened 1
and 1
attracted 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
i 1
gazed 1
with 1
delight 1
on 1
her 1
dark 1
eyes 1
fringed 1
by 1
deep 1
lashes 1
and 1
her 1
lovely 1
lips 1
but 1
presently 1
my 1
rage 1
returned 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
forever 1
deprived 1
of 1
the 1
delights 1
that 1
such 1
beautiful 1
creatures 1
could 1
bestow 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
whose 1
resemblance 1
i 1
contemplated 1
would 1
in 1
regarding 1
me 1
have 1
changed 1
that 1
air 1
of 1
divine 1
benignity 1
to 1
one 1
expressive 1
of 1
disgust 1
and 1
affright 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
thoughts 1
transported 1
me 1
with 1
rage 1
i 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
instead 1
of 1
venting 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
exclamations 1
and 1
agony 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
rush 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
perish 1
in 1
the 1
attempt 1
to 1
destroy 1
them 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
committed 1
the 1
murder 1
and 1
seeking 1
a 1
more 1
secluded 1
hidingplace 1
i 1
entered 1
a 1
barn 1
which 1
had 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
empty 1
a 1
woman 1
was 1
sleeping 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
she 1
was 1
young 1
not 1
indeed 1
so 1
beautiful 1
as 1
her 1
whose 1
portrait 1
i 1
held 1
but 1
of 1
an 1
agreeable 1
aspect 1
and 1
blooming 1
in 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
youth 1
and 1
health 1
here 1
i 1
thought 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
joyimparting 1
smiles 1
are 1
bestowed 1
on 1
all 1
but 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
whispered 1
awake 1
fairest 1
thy 1
lover 1
is 1
nearhe 1
who 1
would 1
give 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
to 1
obtain 1
one 1
look 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
thine 1
eyes 1
my 1
beloved 1
awake 1
the 1
sleeper 1
stirred 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
ran 1
through 1
me 1
should 1
she 1
indeed 1
awake 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
curse 1
me 1
and 1
denounce 1
the 1
murderer 1
thus 1
would 1
she 1
assuredly 1
act 1
if 1
her 1
darkened 1
eyes 1
opened 1
and 1
she 1
beheld 1
me 1
the 1
thought 1
was 1
madness 1
it 1
stirred 1
the 1
fiend 1
within 1
menot 1
i 1
but 1
she 1
shall 1
suffer 1
the 1
murder 1
i 1
have 1
committed 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
forever 1
robbed 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
me 1
she 1
shall 1
atone 1
the 1
crime 1
had 1
its 1
source 1
in 1
her 1
be 1
hers 1
the 1
punishment 1
thanks 1
to 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
the 1
sanguinary 1
laws 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
now 1
to 1
work 1
mischief 1
i 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
placed 1
the 1
portrait 1
securely 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
her 1
dress 1
she 1
moved 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
fled 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
i 1
haunted 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
these 1
scenes 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
sometimes 1
wishing 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
sometimes 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
miseries 1
forever 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
wandered 1
towards 1
these 1
mountains 1
and 1
have 1
ranged 1
through 1
their 1
immense 1
recesses 1
consumed 1
by 1
a 1
burning 1
passion 1
which 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
gratify 1
we 1
may 1
not 1
part 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
requisition 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
and 1
miserable 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
associate 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
one 1
as 1
deformed 1
and 1
horrible 1
as 1
myself 1
would 1
not 1
deny 1
herself 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
companion 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
species 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
defects 1
this 1
being 1
you 1
must 1
create 1
chapter 1
17 1
the 1
being 1
finished 1
speaking 1
and 1
fixed 1
his 1
looks 1
upon 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
a 1
reply 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
bewildered 1
perplexed 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
arrange 1
my 1
ideas 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
full 1
extent 1
of 1
his 1
proposition 1
he 1
continued 1
you 1
must 1
create 1
a 1
female 1
for 1
me 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
being 1
this 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
do 1
and 1
i 1
demand 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
right 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
refuse 1
to 1
concede 1
the 1
latter 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
tale 1
had 1
kindled 1
anew 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
anger 1
that 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
while 1
he 1
narrated 1
his 1
peaceful 1
life 1
among 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
i 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
suppress 1
the 1
rage 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
i 1
do 1
refuse 1
it 1
i 1
replied 1
and 1
no 1
torture 1
shall 1
ever 1
extort 1
a 1
consent 1
from 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
render 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
make 1
me 1
base 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
shall 1
i 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
whose 1
joint 1
wickedness 1
might 1
desolate 1
the 1
world 1
begone 1
i 1
have 1
answered 1
you 1
you 1
may 1
torture 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
consent 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
replied 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
threatening 1
i 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
malicious 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
miserable 1
am 1
i 1
not 1
shunned 1
and 1
hated 1
by 1
all 1
mankind 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
would 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
triumph 1
remember 1
that 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
pity 1
man 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
pities 1
me 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
call 1
it 1
murder 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
precipitate 1
me 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
icerifts 1
and 1
destroy 1
my 1
frame 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
shall 1
i 1
respect 1
man 1
when 1
he 1
condemns 1
me 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
injury 1
i 1
would 1
bestow 1
every 1
benefit 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
tears 1
of 1
gratitude 1
at 1
his 1
acceptance 1
but 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
human 1
senses 1
are 1
insurmountable 1
barriers 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
yet 1
mine 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
submission 1
of 1
abject 1
slavery 1
i 1
will 1
revenge 1
my 1
injuries 1
if 1
i 1
cannot 1
inspire 1
love 1
i 1
will 1
cause 1
fear 1
and 1
chiefly 1
towards 1
you 1
my 1
archenemy 1
because 1
my 1
creator 1
do 1
i 1
swear 1
inextinguishable 1
hatred 1
have 1
a 1
care 1
i 1
will 1
work 1
at 1
your 1
destruction 1
nor 1
finish 1
until 1
i 1
desolate 1
your 1
heart 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
your 1
birth 1
a 1
fiendish 1
rage 1
animated 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
wrinkled 1
into 1
contortions 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
to 1
behold 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
calmed 1
himself 1
and 1
proceeded 1
i 1
intended 1
to 1
reason 1
this 1
passion 1
is 1
detrimental 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
its 1
excess 1
if 1
any 1
being 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
benevolence 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
return 1
them 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
a 1
hundredfold 1
for 1
that 1
one 1
creatures 1
sake 1
i 1
would 1
make 1
peace 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
kind 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
indulge 1
in 1
dreams 1
of 1
bliss 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
realized 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
reasonable 1
and 1
moderate 1
i 1
demand 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
another 1
sex 1
but 1
as 1
hideous 1
as 1
myself 1
the 1
gratification 1
is 1
small 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
receive 1
and 1
it 1
shall 1
content 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
monsters 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
more 1
attached 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
our 1
lives 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
happy 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
harmless 1
and 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
misery 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
oh 1
my 1
creator 1
make 1
me 1
happy 1
let 1
me 1
feel 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
you 1
for 1
one 1
benefit 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
excite 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
some 1
existing 1
thing 1
do 1
not 1
deny 1
me 1
my 1
request 1
i 1
was 1
moved 1
i 1
shuddered 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
possible 1
consequences 1
of 1
my 1
consent 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
justice 1
in 1
his 1
argument 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
the 1
feelings 1
he 1
now 1
expressed 1
proved 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
fine 1
sensations 1
and 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
as 1
his 1
maker 1
owe 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
he 1
saw 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
continued 1
if 1
you 1
consent 1
neither 1
you 1
nor 1
any 1
other 1
human 1
being 1
shall 1
ever 1
see 1
us 1
again 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
vast 1
wilds 1
of 1
south 1
america 1
my 1
food 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
destroy 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
the 1
kid 1
to 1
glut 1
my 1
appetite 1
acorns 1
and 1
berries 1
afford 1
me 1
sufficient 1
nourishment 1
my 1
companion 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
myself 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
fare 1
we 1
shall 1
make 1
our 1
bed 1
of 1
dried 1
leaves 1
the 1
sun 1
will 1
shine 1
on 1
us 1
as 1
on 1
man 1
and 1
will 1
ripen 1
our 1
food 1
the 1
picture 1
i 1
present 1
to 1
you 1
is 1
peaceful 1
and 1
human 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
deny 1
it 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
wantonness 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
cruelty 1
pitiless 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
now 1
see 1
compassion 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
let 1
me 1
seize 1
the 1
favourable 1
moment 1
and 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
promise 1
what 1
i 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
you 1
propose 1
replied 1
i 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
dwell 1
in 1
those 1
wilds 1
where 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
will 1
be 1
your 1
only 1
companions 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
who 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
man 1
persevere 1
in 1
this 1
exile 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
and 1
again 1
seek 1
their 1
kindness 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
meet 1
with 1
their 1
detestation 1
your 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
be 1
renewed 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
have 1
a 1
companion 1
to 1
aid 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
destruction 1
this 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
cease 1
to 1
argue 1
the 1
point 1
for 1
i 1
cannot 1
consent 1
how 1
inconstant 1
are 1
your 1
feelings 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
ago 1
you 1
were 1
moved 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
and 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
again 1
harden 1
yourself 1
to 1
my 1
complaints 1
i 1
swear 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
i 1
inhabit 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
companion 1
you 1
bestow 1
i 1
will 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
dwell 1
as 1
it 1
may 1
chance 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
savage 1
of 1
places 1
my 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
have 1
fled 1
for 1
i 1
shall 1
meet 1
with 1
sympathy 1
my 1
life 1
will 1
flow 1
quietly 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
dying 1
moments 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
curse 1
my 1
maker 1
his 1
words 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
compassionated 1
him 1
and 1
sometimes 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
console 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
filthy 1
mass 1
that 1
moved 1
and 1
talked 1
my 1
heart 1
sickened 1
and 1
my 1
feelings 1
were 1
altered 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
hatred 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
stifle 1
these 1
sensations 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sympathize 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
withhold 1
from 1
him 1
the 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
was 1
yet 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
you 1
swear 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
harmless 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
already 1
shown 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
malice 1
that 1
should 1
reasonably 1
make 1
me 1
distrust 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
even 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
feint 1
that 1
will 1
increase 1
your 1
triumph 1
by 1
affording 1
a 1
wider 1
scope 1
for 1
your 1
revenge 1
how 1
is 1
this 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
trifled 1
with 1
and 1
i 1
demand 1
an 1
answer 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
ties 1
and 1
no 1
affections 1
hatred 1
and 1
vice 1
must 1
be 1
my 1
portion 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
another 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
become 1
a 1
thing 1
of 1
whose 1
existence 1
everyone 1
will 1
be 1
ignorant 1
my 1
vices 1
are 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
a 1
forced 1
solitude 1
that 1
i 1
abhor 1
and 1
my 1
virtues 1
will 1
necessarily 1
arise 1
when 1
i 1
live 1
in 1
communion 1
with 1
an 1
equal 1
i 1
shall 1
feel 1
the 1
affections 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
and 1
become 1
linked 1
to 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
existence 1
and 1
events 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
excluded 1
i 1
paused 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
related 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
employed 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
virtues 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
displayed 1
on 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
his 1
existence 1
and 1
the 1
subsequent 1
blight 1
of 1
all 1
kindly 1
feeling 1
by 1
the 1
loathing 1
and 1
scorn 1
which 1
his 1
protectors 1
had 1
manifested 1
towards 1
him 1
his 1
power 1
and 1
threats 1
were 1
not 1
omitted 1
in 1
my 1
calculations 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
could 1
exist 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
caves 1
of 1
the 1
glaciers 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
from 1
pursuit 1
among 1
the 1
ridges 1
of 1
inaccessible 1
precipices 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
possessing 1
faculties 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
vain 1
to 1
cope 1
with 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
of 1
reflection 1
i 1
concluded 1
that 1
the 1
justice 1
due 1
both 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
demanded 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
request 1
turning 1
to 1
him 1
therefore 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
consent 1
to 1
your 1
demand 1
on 1
your 1
solemn 1
oath 1
to 1
quit 1
europe 1
forever 1
and 1
every 1
other 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
shall 1
deliver 1
into 1
your 1
hands 1
a 1
female 1
who 1
will 1
accompany 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
exile 1
i 1
swear 1
he 1
cried 1
by 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
blue 1
sky 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
of 1
love 1
that 1
burns 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
grant 1
my 1
prayer 1
while 1
they 1
exist 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
behold 1
me 1
again 1
depart 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
and 1
commence 1
your 1
labours 1
i 1
shall 1
watch 1
their 1
progress 1
with 1
unutterable 1
anxiety 1
and 1
fear 1
not 1
but 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
i 1
shall 1
appear 1
saying 1
this 1
he 1
suddenly 1
quitted 1
me 1
fearful 1
perhaps 1
of 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
my 1
sentiments 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
descend 1
the 1
mountain 1
with 1
greater 1
speed 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
an 1
eagle 1
and 1
quickly 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
undulations 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
his 1
tale 1
had 1
occupied 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
hasten 1
my 1
descent 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
be 1
encompassed 1
in 1
darkness 1
but 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
my 1
steps 1
slow 1
the 1
labour 1
of 1
winding 1
among 1
the 1
little 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
fixing 1
my 1
feet 1
firmly 1
as 1
i 1
advanced 1
perplexed 1
me 1
occupied 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
by 1
the 1
emotions 1
which 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
produced 1
night 1
was 1
far 1
advanced 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
halfway 1
restingplace 1
and 1
seated 1
myself 1
beside 1
the 1
fountain 1
the 1
stars 1
shone 1
at 1
intervals 1
as 1
the 1
clouds 1
passed 1
from 1
over 1
them 1
the 1
dark 1
pines 1
rose 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
broken 1
tree 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
wonderful 1
solemnity 1
and 1
stirred 1
strange 1
thoughts 1
within 1
me 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
clasping 1
my 1
hands 1
in 1
agony 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
oh 1
stars 1
and 1
clouds 1
and 1
winds 1
ye 1
are 1
all 1
about 1
to 1
mock 1
me 1
if 1
ye 1
really 1
pity 1
me 1
crush 1
sensation 1
and 1
memory 1
let 1
me 1
become 1
as 1
nought 1
but 1
if 1
not 1
depart 1
depart 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
in 1
darkness 1
these 1
were 1
wild 1
and 1
miserable 1
thoughts 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
the 1
eternal 1
twinkling 1
of 1
the 1
stars 1
weighed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
how 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
every 1
blast 1
of 1
wind 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
dull 1
ugly 1
siroc 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
consume 1
me 1
morning 1
dawned 1
before 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
chamounix 1
i 1
took 1
no 1
rest 1
but 1
returned 1
immediately 1
to 1
geneva 1
even 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
i 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
expression 1
to 1
my 1
sensationsthey 1
weighed 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
mountains 1
weight 1
and 1
their 1
excess 1
destroyed 1
my 1
agony 1
beneath 1
them 1
thus 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
presented 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
family 1
my 1
haggard 1
and 1
wild 1
appearance 1
awoke 1
intense 1
alarm 1
but 1
i 1
answered 1
no 1
question 1
scarcely 1
did 1
i 1
speak 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
placed 1
under 1
a 1
banas 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
sympathiesas 1
if 1
never 1
more 1
might 1
i 1
enjoy 1
companionship 1
with 1
them 1
yet 1
even 1
thus 1
i 1
loved 1
them 1
to 1
adoration 1
and 1
to 1
save 1
them 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
dedicate 1
myself 1
to 1
my 1
most 1
abhorred 1
task 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
such 1
an 1
occupation 1
made 1
every 1
other 1
circumstance 1
of 1
existence 1
pass 1
before 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
that 1
thought 1
only 1
had 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
life 1

day 1
after 1
day 1
week 1
after 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
collect 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
work 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
disappointed 1
fiend 1
yet 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
overcome 1
my 1
repugnance 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
was 1
enjoined 1
me 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
compose 1
a 1
female 1
without 1
again 1
devoting 1
several 1
months 1
to 1
profound 1
study 1
and 1
laborious 1
disquisition 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
having 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
an 1
english 1
philosopher 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
material 1
to 1
my 1
success 1
and 1
i 1
sometimes 1
thought 1
of 1
obtaining 1
my 1
fathers 1
consent 1
to 1
visit 1
england 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
but 1
i 1
clung 1
to 1
every 1
pretence 1
of 1
delay 1
and 1
shrank 1
from 1
taking 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
in 1
an 1
undertaking 1
whose 1
immediate 1
necessity 1
began 1
to 1
appear 1
less 1
absolute 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
change 1
indeed 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
me 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
declined 1
was 1
now 1
much 1
restored 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
when 1
unchecked 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
my 1
unhappy 1
promise 1
rose 1
proportionably 1
my 1
father 1
saw 1
this 1
change 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
thoughts 1
towards 1
the 1
best 1
method 1
of 1
eradicating 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
melancholy 1
which 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
would 1
return 1
by 1
fits 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
blackness 1
overcast 1
the 1
approaching 1
sunshine 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
solitude 1
i 1
passed 1
whole 1
days 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
alone 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
watching 1
the 1
clouds 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rippling 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
silent 1
and 1
listless 1
but 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
and 1
bright 1
sun 1
seldom 1
failed 1
to 1
restore 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
composure 1
and 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
met 1
the 1
salutations 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
with 1
a 1
readier 1
smile 1
and 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
heart 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
rambles 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
calling 1
me 1
aside 1
thus 1
addressed 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
to 1
remark 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
resumed 1
your 1
former 1
pleasures 1
and 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
returning 1
to 1
yourself 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
are 1
still 1
unhappy 1
and 1
still 1
avoid 1
our 1
society 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
conjecture 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
but 1
yesterday 1
an 1
idea 1
struck 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
founded 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
to 1
avow 1
it 1
reserve 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
point 1
would 1
be 1
not 1
only 1
useless 1
but 1
draw 1
down 1
treble 1
misery 1
on 1
us 1
all 1
i 1
trembled 1
violently 1
at 1
his 1
exordium 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
continuedi 1
confess 1
my 1
son 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
your 1
marriage 1
with 1
our 1
dear 1
elizabeth 1
as 1
the 1
tie 1
of 1
our 1
domestic 1
comfort 1
and 1
the 1
stay 1
of 1
my 1
declining 1
years 1
you 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
your 1
earliest 1
infancy 1
you 1
studied 1
together 1
and 1
appeared 1
in 1
dispositions 1
and 1
tastes 1
entirely 1
suited 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
but 1
so 1
blind 1
is 1
the 1
experience 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
what 1
i 1
conceived 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
assistants 1
to 1
my 1
plan 1
may 1
have 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
it 1
you 1
perhaps 1
regard 1
her 1
as 1
your 1
sister 1
without 1
any 1
wish 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
your 1
wife 1
nay 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
met 1
with 1
another 1
whom 1
you 1
may 1
love 1
and 1
considering 1
yourself 1
as 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
this 1
struggle 1
may 1
occasion 1
the 1
poignant 1
misery 1
which 1
you 1
appear 1
to 1
feel 1
my 1
dear 1
father 1
reassure 1
yourself 1
i 1
love 1
my 1
cousin 1
tenderly 1
and 1
sincerely 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
excited 1
as 1
elizabeth 1
does 1
my 1
warmest 1
admiration 1
and 1
affection 1
my 1
future 1
hopes 1
and 1
prospects 1
are 1
entirely 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
our 1
union 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
your 1
sentiments 1
of 1
this 1
subject 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
gives 1
me 1
more 1
pleasure 1
than 1
i 1
have 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
experienced 1
if 1
you 1
feel 1
thus 1
we 1
shall 1
assuredly 1
be 1
happy 1
however 1
present 1
events 1
may 1
cast 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
us 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
gloom 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
so 1
strong 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
dissipate 1
tell 1
me 1
therefore 1
whether 1
you 1
object 1
to 1
an 1
immediate 1
solemnization 1
of 1
the 1
marriage 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
recent 1
events 1
have 1
drawn 1
us 1
from 1
that 1
everyday 1
tranquillity 1
befitting 1
my 1
years 1
and 1
infirmities 1
you 1
are 1
younger 1
yet 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
possessed 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
a 1
competent 1
fortune 1
that 1
an 1
early 1
marriage 1
would 1
at 1
all 1
interfere 1
with 1
any 1
future 1
plans 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
utility 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
formed 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
however 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
dictate 1
happiness 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
that 1
a 1
delay 1
on 1
your 1
part 1
would 1
cause 1
me 1
any 1
serious 1
uneasiness 1
interpret 1
my 1
words 1
with 1
candour 1
and 1
answer 1
me 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
with 1
confidence 1
and 1
sincerity 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
remained 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
incapable 1
of 1
offering 1
any 1
reply 1
i 1
revolved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
thoughts 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
some 1
conclusion 1
alas 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
an 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
dismay 1
i 1
was 1
bound 1
by 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
break 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
what 1
manifold 1
miseries 1
might 1
not 1
impend 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
devoted 1
family 1
could 1
i 1
enter 1
into 1
a 1
festival 1
with 1
this 1
deadly 1
weight 1
yet 1
hanging 1
round 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
bowing 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
must 1
perform 1
my 1
engagement 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
monster 1
depart 1
with 1
his 1
mate 1
before 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
a 1
union 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
expected 1
peace 1
i 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
necessity 1
imposed 1
upon 1
me 1
of 1
either 1
journeying 1
to 1
england 1
or 1
entering 1
into 1
a 1
long 1
correspondence 1
with 1
those 1
philosophers 1
of 1
that 1
country 1
whose 1
knowledge 1
and 1
discoveries 1
were 1
of 1
indispensable 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
the 1
latter 1
method 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
desired 1
intelligence 1
was 1
dilatory 1
and 1
unsatisfactory 1
besides 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
aversion 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
engaging 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
loathsome 1
task 1
in 1
my 1
fathers 1
house 1
while 1
in 1
habits 1
of 1
familiar 1
intercourse 1
with 1
those 1
i 1
loved 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
a 1
thousand 1
fearful 1
accidents 1
might 1
occur 1
the 1
slightest 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
disclose 1
a 1
tale 1
to 1
thrill 1
all 1
connected 1
with 1
me 1
with 1
horror 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
also 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
often 1
lose 1
all 1
selfcommand 1
all 1
capacity 1
of 1
hiding 1
the 1
harrowing 1
sensations 1
that 1
would 1
possess 1
me 1
during 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
unearthly 1
occupation 1
i 1
must 1
absent 1
myself 1
from 1
all 1
i 1
loved 1
while 1
thus 1
employed 1
once 1
commenced 1
it 1
would 1
quickly 1
be 1
achieved 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
restored 1
to 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
happiness 1
my 1
promise 1
fulfilled 1
the 1
monster 1
would 1
depart 1
forever 1
or 1
so 1
my 1
fond 1
fancy 1
imaged 1
some 1
accident 1
might 1
meanwhile 1
occur 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
my 1
slavery 1
forever 1
these 1
feelings 1
dictated 1
my 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
expressed 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
visit 1
england 1
but 1
concealing 1
the 1
true 1
reasons 1
of 1
this 1
request 1
i 1
clothed 1
my 1
desires 1
under 1
a 1
guise 1
which 1
excited 1
no 1
suspicion 1
while 1
i 1
urged 1
my 1
desire 1
with 1
an 1
earnestness 1
that 1
easily 1
induced 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
comply 1
after 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
an 1
absorbing 1
melancholy 1
that 1
resembled 1
madness 1
in 1
its 1
intensity 1
and 1
effects 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
taking 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
that 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
varied 1
amusement 1
would 1
before 1
my 1
return 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
entirely 1
to 1
myself 1
the 1
duration 1
of 1
my 1
absence 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
choice 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
or 1
at 1
most 1
a 1
year 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
contemplated 1
one 1
paternal 1
kind 1
precaution 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
ensure 1
my 1
having 1
a 1
companion 1
without 1
previously 1
communicating 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
concert 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
arranged 1
that 1
clerval 1
should 1
join 1
me 1
at 1
strasbourg 1
this 1
interfered 1
with 1
the 1
solitude 1
i 1
coveted 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
be 1
an 1
impediment 1
and 1
truly 1
i 1
rejoiced 1
that 1
thus 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
saved 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
lonely 1
maddening 1
reflection 1
nay 1
henry 1
might 1
stand 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
alone 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
at 1
times 1
force 1
his 1
abhorred 1
presence 1
on 1
me 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
or 1
to 1
contemplate 1
its 1
progress 1
to 1
england 1
therefore 1
i 1
was 1
bound 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
understood 1
that 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
immediately 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
my 1
fathers 1
age 1
rendered 1
him 1
extremely 1
averse 1
to 1
delay 1
for 1
myself 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
reward 1
i 1
promised 1
myself 1
from 1
my 1
detested 1
toilsone 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
unparalleled 1
sufferings 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
when 1
enfranchised 1
from 1
my 1
miserable 1
slavery 1
i 1
might 1
claim 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
forget 1
the 1
past 1
in 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
her 1
i 1
now 1
made 1
arrangements 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
haunted 1
me 1
which 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
agitation 1
during 1
my 1
absence 1
i 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
friends 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
their 1
enemy 1
and 1
unprotected 1
from 1
his 1
attacks 1
exasperated 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
by 1
my 1
departure 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
follow 1
me 1
wherever 1
i 1
might 1
go 1
and 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
accompany 1
me 1
to 1
england 1
this 1
imagination 1
was 1
dreadful 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
soothing 1
inasmuch 1
as 1
it 1
supposed 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
i 1
was 1
agonized 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
possibility 1
that 1
the 1
reverse 1
of 1
this 1
might 1
happen 1
but 1
through 1
the 1
whole 1
period 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
my 1
creature 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
governed 1
by 1
the 1
impulses 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
and 1
my 1
present 1
sensations 1
strongly 1
intimated 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
would 1
follow 1
me 1
and 1
exempt 1
my 1
family 1
from 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
his 1
machinations 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
september 1
that 1
i 1
again 1
quitted 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
my 1
journey 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
own 1
suggestion 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
therefore 1
acquiesced 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
disquiet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
my 1
suffering 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
the 1
inroads 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
grief 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
care 1
which 1
provided 1
me 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
clervaland 1
yet 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
blind 1
to 1
a 1
thousand 1
minute 1
circumstances 1
which 1
call 1
forth 1
a 1
womans 1
sedulous 1
attention 1
she 1
longed 1
to 1
bid 1
me 1
hasten 1
my 1
return 1
a 1
thousand 1
conflicting 1
emotions 1
rendered 1
her 1
mute 1
as 1
she 1
bade 1
me 1
a 1
tearful 1
silent 1
farewell 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
whither 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
careless 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
passing 1
around 1
i 1
remembered 1
only 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
that 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
it 1
to 1
order 1
that 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
should 1
be 1
packed 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
filled 1
with 1
dreary 1
imaginations 1
i 1
passed 1
through 1
many 1
beautiful 1
and 1
majestic 1
scenes 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
fixed 1
and 1
unobserving 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
bourne 1
of 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
occupy 1
me 1
whilst 1
they 1
endured 1
after 1
some 1
days 1
spent 1
in 1
listless 1
indolence 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
traversed 1
many 1
leagues 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
strasbourg 1
where 1
i 1
waited 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
clerval 1
he 1
came 1
alas 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
us 1
he 1
was 1
alive 1
to 1
every 1
new 1
scene 1
joyful 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
and 1
more 1
happy 1
when 1
he 1
beheld 1
it 1
rise 1
and 1
recommence 1
a 1
new 1
day 1
he 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
shifting 1
colours 1
of 1
the 1
landscape 1
and 1
the 1
appearances 1
of 1
the 1
sky 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
live 1
he 1
cried 1
how 1
i 1
enjoy 1
existence 1
but 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
wherefore 1
are 1
you 1
desponding 1
and 1
sorrowful 1
in 1
truth 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
and 1
neither 1
saw 1
the 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
star 1
nor 1
the 1
golden 1
sunrise 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
rhine 1
and 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
would 1
be 1
far 1
more 1
amused 1
with 1
the 1
journal 1
of 1
clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
the 1
scenery 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
delight 1
than 1
in 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
reflections 1
i 1
a 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
haunted 1
by 1
a 1
curse 1
that 1
shut 1
up 1
every 1
avenue 1
to 1
enjoyment 1
we 1
had 1
agreed 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
rhine 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
from 1
strasbourg 1
to 1
rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
might 1
take 1
shipping 1
for 1
london 1
during 1
this 1
voyage 1
we 1
passed 1
many 1
willowy 1
islands 1
and 1
saw 1
several 1
beautiful 1
towns 1
we 1
stayed 1
a 1
day 1
at 1
mannheim 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fifth 1
from 1
our 1
departure 1
from 1
strasbourg 1
arrived 1
at 1
mainz 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
below 1
mainz 1
becomes 1
much 1
more 1
picturesque 1
the 1
river 1
descends 1
rapidly 1
and 1
winds 1
between 1
hills 1
not 1
high 1
but 1
steep 1
and 1
of 1
beautiful 1
forms 1
we 1
saw 1
many 1
ruined 1
castles 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
precipices 1
surrounded 1
by 1
black 1
woods 1
high 1
and 1
inaccessible 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
indeed 1
presents 1
a 1
singularly 1
variegated 1
landscape 1
in 1
one 1
spot 1
you 1
view 1
rugged 1
hills 1
ruined 1
castles 1
overlooking 1
tremendous 1
precipices 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
rhine 1
rushing 1
beneath 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
sudden 1
turn 1
of 1
a 1
promontory 1
flourishing 1
vineyards 1
with 1
green 1
sloping 1
banks 1
and 1
a 1
meandering 1
river 1
and 1
populous 1
towns 1
occupy 1
the 1
scene 1
we 1
travelled 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
vintage 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
song 1
of 1
the 1
labourers 1
as 1
we 1
glided 1
down 1
the 1
stream 1
even 1
i 1
depressed 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
continually 1
agitated 1
by 1
gloomy 1
feelings 1
even 1
i 1
was 1
pleased 1
i 1
lay 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
cloudless 1
blue 1
sky 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
a 1
tranquillity 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
if 1
these 1
were 1
my 1
sensations 1
who 1
can 1
describe 1
those 1
of 1
henry 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
transported 1
to 1
fairyland 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
a 1
happiness 1
seldom 1
tasted 1
by 1
man 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
country 1
i 1
have 1
visited 1
the 1
lakes 1
of 1
lucerne 1
and 1
uri 1
where 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
descend 1
almost 1
perpendicularly 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
casting 1
black 1
and 1
impenetrable 1
shades 1
which 1
would 1
cause 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
mournful 1
appearance 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
verdant 1
islands 1
that 1
believe 1
the 1
eye 1
by 1
their 1
gay 1
appearance 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
lake 1
agitated 1
by 1
a 1
tempest 1
when 1
the 1
wind 1
tore 1
up 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
gave 1
you 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
waterspout 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
great 1
ocean 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
dash 1
with 1
fury 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
where 1
the 1
priest 1
and 1
his 1
mistress 1
were 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
an 1
avalanche 1
and 1
where 1
their 1
dying 1
voices 1
are 1
still 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
amid 1
the 1
pauses 1
of 1
the 1
nightly 1
wind 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
la 1
valais 1
and 1
the 1
pays 1
de 1
vaud 1
but 1
this 1
country 1
victor 1
pleases 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
those 1
wonders 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
switzerland 1
are 1
more 1
majestic 1
and 1
strange 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
charm 1
in 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
this 1
divine 1
river 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
before 1
saw 1
equalled 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
castle 1
which 1
overhangs 1
yon 1
precipice 1
and 1
that 1
also 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
almost 1
concealed 1
amongst 1
the 1
foliage 1
of 1
those 1
lovely 1
trees 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
group 1
of 1
labourers 1
coming 1
from 1
among 1
their 1
vines 1
and 1
that 1
village 1
half 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
oh 1
surely 1
the 1
spirit 1
that 1
inhabits 1
and 1
guards 1
this 1
place 1
has 1
a 1
soul 1
more 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
man 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
pile 1
the 1
glacier 1
or 1
retire 1
to 1
the 1
inaccessible 1
peaks 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
clerval 1
beloved 1
friend 1
even 1
now 1
it 1
delights 1
me 1
to 1
record 1
your 1
words 1
and 1
to 1
dwell 1
on 1
the 1
praise 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
eminently 1
deserving 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
formed 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
poetry 1
of 1
nature 1
his 1
wild 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
imagination 1
was 1
chastened 1
by 1
the 1
sensibility 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
his 1
soul 1
overflowed 1
with 1
ardent 1
affections 1
and 1
his 1
friendship 1
was 1
of 1
that 1
devoted 1
and 1
wondrous 1
nature 1
that 1
the 1
worldminded 1
teach 1
us 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
imagination 1
but 1
even 1
human 1
sympathies 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
satisfy 1
his 1
eager 1
mind 1
the 1
scenery 1
of 1
external 1
nature 1
which 1
others 1
regard 1
only 1
with 1
admiration 1
he 1
loved 1
with 1
ardour 1
the 1
sounding 1
cataract 1
haunted 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
passion 1
the 1
tall 1
rock 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
gloomy 1
wood 1
their 1
colours 1
and 1
their 1
forms 1
were 1
then 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
appetite 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
a 1
love 1
that 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
a 1
remoter 1
charm 1
by 1
thought 1
supplied 1

any 1

this 1
gentle 1
and 1
lovely 1
being 1
lost 1
forever 1
has 1
this 1
mind 1
so 1
replete 1
with 1
ideas 1
imaginations 1
fanciful 1
and 1
magnificent 1
which 1
formed 1
a 1
world 1

existence 1

exist 1
in 1
my 1

not 1
thus 1
your 1
form 1
so 1
divinely 1
wrought 1
and 1
beaming 1
with 1
beauty 1
has 1
decayed 1
but 1
your 1
spirit 1
still 1
visits 1
and 1
consoles 1
your 1
unhappy 1
friend 1
pardon 1
this 1
gush 1
of 1
sorrow 1
these 1
ineffectual 1
words 1
are 1
but 1
a 1
slight 1
tribute 1
to 1
the 1
unexampled 1
worth 1
of 1
henry 1
but 1
they 1
soothe 1
my 1
heart 1
overflowing 1
with 1
the 1
anguish 1
which 1
his 1
remembrance 1
creates 1
i 1
will 1
proceed 1
with 1
my 1
tale 1
beyond 1
cologne 1
we 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
plains 1
of 1
holland 1
and 1
we 1
resolved 1
to 1
post 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
our 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
contrary 1
and 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
too 1
gentle 1
to 1
aid 1
us 1
our 1
journey 1
here 1
lost 1
the 1
interest 1
arising 1
from 1
beautiful 1
scenery 1
but 1
we 1
arrived 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
by 1
sea 1
to 1
england 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
clear 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
days 1
of 1
december 1
that 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
cliffs 1
of 1
britain 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
thames 1
presented 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
they 1
were 1
flat 1
but 1
fertile 1
and 1
almost 1
every 1
town 1
was 1
marked 1
by 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
some 1
story 1
we 1
saw 1
tilbury 1
fort 1
and 1
remembered 1
the 1
spanish 1
armada 1
gravesend 1
woolwich 1
and 1
greenwichplaces 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
even 1
in 1
my 1
country 1
at 1
length 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
numerous 1
steeples 1
of 1
london 1
st 1
pauls 1
towering 1
above 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
tower 1
famed 1
in 1
english 1
history 1
chapter 1
19 1
london 1
was 1
our 1
present 1
point 1
of 1
rest 1
we 1
determined 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
months 1
in 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
celebrated 1
city 1
clerval 1
desired 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
talent 1
who 1
flourished 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
secondary 1
object 1
i 1
was 1
principally 1
occupied 1
with 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
information 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
and 1
quickly 1
availed 1
myself 1
of 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
addressed 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
natural 1
philosophers 1
if 1
this 1
journey 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
my 1
days 1
of 1
study 1
and 1
happiness 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
afforded 1
me 1
inexpressible 1
pleasure 1
but 1
a 1
blight 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
visited 1
these 1
people 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
they 1
might 1
give 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
was 1
so 1
terribly 1
profound 1
company 1
was 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
alone 1
i 1
could 1
fill 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
sights 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
henry 1
soothed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
thus 1
cheat 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
transitory 1
peace 1
but 1
busy 1
uninteresting 1
joyous 1
faces 1
brought 1
back 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
saw 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
placed 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
men 1
this 1
barrier 1
was 1
sealed 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
justine 1
and 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
events 1
connected 1
with 1
those 1
names 1
filled 1
my 1
soul 1
with 1
anguish 1
but 1
in 1
clerval 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
self 1
he 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
and 1
anxious 1
to 1
gain 1
experience 1
and 1
instruction 1
the 1
difference 1
of 1
manners 1
which 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
inexhaustible 1
source 1
of 1
instruction 1
and 1
amusement 1
he 1
was 1
also 1
pursuing 1
an 1
object 1
he 1
had 1
long 1
had 1
in 1
view 1
his 1
design 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
india 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
knowledge 1
of 1
its 1
various 1
languages 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
views 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
its 1
society 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
materially 1
assisting 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
european 1
colonization 1
and 1
trade 1
in 1
britain 1
only 1
could 1
he 1
further 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
he 1
was 1
forever 1
busy 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
check 1
to 1
his 1
enjoyments 1
was 1
my 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
dejected 1
mind 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
conceal 1
this 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
not 1
debar 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
pleasures 1
natural 1
to 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
entering 1
on 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
life 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
any 1
care 1
or 1
bitter 1
recollection 1
i 1
often 1
refused 1
to 1
accompany 1
him 1
alleging 1
another 1
engagement 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
remain 1
alone 1
i 1
now 1
also 1
began 1
to 1
collect 1
the 1
materials 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
new 1
creation 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
torture 1
of 1
single 1
drops 1
of 1
water 1
continually 1
falling 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
every 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
devoted 1
to 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
and 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
i 1
spoke 1
in 1
allusion 1
to 1
it 1
caused 1
my 1
lips 1
to 1
quiver 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
palpitate 1
after 1
passing 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
london 1
we 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
scotland 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
our 1
visitor 1
at 1
geneva 1
he 1
mentioned 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
his 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
asked 1
us 1
if 1
those 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
allurements 1
to 1
induce 1
us 1
to 1
prolong 1
our 1
journey 1
as 1
far 1
north 1
as 1
perth 1
where 1
he 1
resided 1
clerval 1
eagerly 1
desired 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
invitation 1
and 1
i 1
although 1
i 1
abhorred 1
society 1
wished 1
to 1
view 1
again 1
mountains 1
and 1
streams 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
wondrous 1
works 1
with 1
which 1
nature 1
adorns 1
her 1
chosen 1
dwellingplaces 1
we 1
had 1
arrived 1
in 1
england 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
october 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
february 1
we 1
accordingly 1
determined 1
to 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
another 1
month 1
in 1
this 1
expedition 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
great 1
road 1
to 1
edinburgh 1
but 1
to 1
visit 1
windsor 1
oxford 1
matlock 1
and 1
the 1
cumberland 1
lakes 1
resolving 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
this 1
tour 1
about 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
july 1
i 1
packed 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
the 1
materials 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
resolving 1
to 1
finish 1
my 1
labours 1
in 1
some 1
obscure 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
of 1
scotland 1
we 1
quitted 1
london 1
on 1
the 1
27th 1
of 1
march 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
windsor 1
rambling 1
in 1
its 1
beautiful 1
forest 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
to 1
us 1
mountaineers 1
the 1
majestic 1
oaks 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
game 1
and 1
the 1
herds 1
of 1
stately 1
deer 1
were 1
all 1
novelties 1
to 1
us 1
from 1
thence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
to 1
oxford 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
this 1
city 1
our 1
minds 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
transacted 1
there 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
century 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
charles 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
his 1
forces 1
this 1
city 1
had 1
remained 1
faithful 1
to 1
him 1
after 1
the 1
whole 1
nation 1
had 1
forsaken 1
his 1
cause 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
parliament 1
and 1
liberty 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
king 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
the 1
amiable 1
falkland 1
the 1
insolent 1
goring 1
his 1
queen 1
and 1
son 1
gave 1
a 1
peculiar 1
interest 1
to 1
every 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
which 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
inhabited 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
elder 1
days 1
found 1
a 1
dwelling 1
here 1
and 1
we 1
delighted 1
to 1
trace 1
its 1
footsteps 1
if 1
these 1
feelings 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
an 1
imaginary 1
gratification 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
had 1
yet 1
in 1
itself 1
sufficient 1
beauty 1
to 1
obtain 1
our 1
admiration 1
the 1
colleges 1
are 1
ancient 1
and 1
picturesque 1
the 1
streets 1
are 1
almost 1
magnificent 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
isis 1
which 1
flows 1
beside 1
it 1
through 1
meadows 1
of 1
exquisite 1
verdure 1
is 1
spread 1
forth 1
into 1
a 1
placid 1
expanse 1
of 1
waters 1
which 1
reflects 1
its 1
majestic 1
assemblage 1
of 1
towers 1
and 1
spires 1
and 1
domes 1
embosomed 1
among 1
aged 1
trees 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
this 1
scene 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
enjoyment 1
was 1
embittered 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
anticipation 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
i 1
was 1
formed 1
for 1
peaceful 1
happiness 1
during 1
my 1
youthful 1
days 1
discontent 1
never 1
visited 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
ever 1
overcome 1
by 1
ennui 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
beautiful 1
in 1
nature 1
or 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
excellent 1
and 1
sublime 1
in 1
the 1
productions 1
of 1
man 1
could 1
always 1
interest 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
communicate 1
elasticity 1
to 1
my 1
spirits 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
blasted 1
tree 1
the 1
bolt 1
has 1
entered 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
survive 1
to 1
exhibit 1
what 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
cease 1
to 1
bea 1
miserable 1
spectacle 1
of 1
wrecked 1
humanity 1
pitiable 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
intolerable 1
to 1
myself 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
considerable 1
period 1
at 1
oxford 1
rambling 1
among 1
its 1
environs 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
identify 1
every 1
spot 1
which 1
might 1
relate 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
animating 1
epoch 1
of 1
english 1
history 1
our 1
little 1
voyages 1
of 1
discovery 1
were 1
often 1
prolonged 1
by 1
the 1
successive 1
objects 1
that 1
presented 1
themselves 1
we 1
visited 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
the 1
illustrious 1
hampden 1
and 1
the 1
field 1
on 1
which 1
that 1
patriot 1
fell 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
soul 1
was 1
elevated 1
from 1
its 1
debasing 1
and 1
miserable 1
fears 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
divine 1
ideas 1
of 1
liberty 1
and 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
which 1
these 1
sights 1
were 1
the 1
monuments 1
and 1
the 1
remembrancers 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
i 1
dared 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
my 1
chains 1
and 1
look 1
around 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
free 1
and 1
lofty 1
spirit 1
but 1
the 1
iron 1
had 1
eaten 1
into 1
my 1
flesh 1
and 1
i 1
sank 1
again 1
trembling 1
and 1
hopeless 1
into 1
my 1
miserable 1
self 1
we 1
left 1
oxford 1
with 1
regret 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
matlock 1
which 1
was 1
our 1
next 1
place 1
of 1
rest 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
this 1
village 1
resembled 1
to 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
the 1
scenery 1
of 1
switzerland 1
but 1
everything 1
is 1
on 1
a 1
lower 1
scale 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
hills 1
want 1
the 1
crown 1
of 1
distant 1
white 1
alps 1
which 1
always 1
attend 1
on 1
the 1
piny 1
mountains 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
visited 1
the 1
wondrous 1
cave 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
cabinets 1
of 1
natural 1
history 1
where 1
the 1
curiosities 1
are 1
disposed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
collections 1
at 1
servox 1
and 1
chamounix 1
the 1
latter 1
name 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
when 1
pronounced 1
by 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
quit 1
matlock 1
with 1
which 1
that 1
terrible 1
scene 1
was 1
thus 1
associated 1
from 1
derby 1
still 1
journeying 1
northwards 1
we 1
passed 1
two 1
months 1
in 1
cumberland 1
and 1
westmorland 1
i 1
could 1
now 1
almost 1
fancy 1
myself 1
among 1
the 1
swiss 1
mountains 1
the 1
little 1
patches 1
of 1
snow 1
which 1
yet 1
lingered 1
on 1
the 1
northern 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
the 1
lakes 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
rocky 1
streams 1
were 1
all 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
sights 1
to 1
me 1
here 1
also 1
we 1
made 1
some 1
acquaintances 1
who 1
almost 1
contrived 1
to 1
cheat 1
me 1
into 1
happiness 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
clerval 1
was 1
proportionably 1
greater 1
than 1
mine 1
his 1
mind 1
expanded 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
talent 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
nature 1
greater 1
capacities 1
and 1
resources 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
imagined 1
himself 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
while 1
he 1
associated 1
with 1
his 1
inferiors 1
i 1
could 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
here 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
among 1
these 1
mountains 1
i 1
should 1
scarcely 1
regret 1
switzerland 1
and 1
the 1
rhine 1
but 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
travellers 1
life 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
includes 1
much 1
pain 1
amidst 1
its 1
enjoyments 1
his 1
feelings 1
are 1
forever 1
on 1
the 1
stretch 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
begins 1
to 1
sink 1
into 1
repose 1
he 1
finds 1
himself 1
obliged 1
to 1
quit 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
rests 1
in 1
pleasure 1
for 1
something 1
new 1
which 1
again 1
engages 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
which 1
also 1
he 1
forsakes 1
for 1
other 1
novelties 1
we 1
had 1
scarcely 1
visited 1
the 1
various 1
lakes 1
of 1
cumberland 1
and 1
westmorland 1
and 1
conceived 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
when 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
our 1
appointment 1
with 1
our 1
scotch 1
friend 1
approached 1
and 1
we 1
left 1
them 1
to 1
travel 1
on 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
sorry 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
neglected 1
my 1
promise 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
the 1
daemons 1
disappointment 1
he 1
might 1
remain 1
in 1
switzerland 1
and 1
wreak 1
his 1
vengeance 1
on 1
my 1
relatives 1
this 1
idea 1
pursued 1
me 1
and 1
tormented 1
me 1
at 1
every 1
moment 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
snatched 1
repose 1
and 1
peace 1
i 1
waited 1
for 1
my 1
letters 1
with 1
feverish 1
impatience 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
delayed 1
i 1
was 1
miserable 1
and 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
superscription 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
or 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
hardly 1
dared 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
ascertain 1
my 1
fate 1
sometimes 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
might 1
expedite 1
my 1
remissness 1
by 1
murdering 1
my 1
companion 1
when 1
these 1
thoughts 1
possessed 1
me 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
quit 1
henry 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
followed 1
him 1
as 1
his 1
shadow 1
to 1
protect 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
fancied 1
rage 1
of 1
his 1
destroyer 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
committed 1
some 1
great 1
crime 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
which 1
haunted 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
guiltless 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
indeed 1
drawn 1
down 1
a 1
horrible 1
curse 1
upon 1
my 1
head 1
as 1
mortal 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
crime 1
i 1
visited 1
edinburgh 1
with 1
languid 1
eyes 1
and 1
mind 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
city 1
might 1
have 1
interested 1
the 1
most 1
unfortunate 1
being 1
clerval 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
as 1
oxford 1
for 1
the 1
antiquity 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
city 1
was 1
more 1
pleasing 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
regularity 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
town 1
of 1
edinburgh 1
its 1
romantic 1
castle 1
and 1
its 1
environs 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
arthurs 1
seat 1
st 1
bernards 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
pentland 1
hills 1
compensated 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
change 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
cheerfulness 1
and 1
admiration 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
impatient 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
termination 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
we 1
left 1
edinburgh 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
passing 1
through 1
coupar 1
st 1
andrews 1
and 1
along 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
tay 1
to 1
perth 1
where 1
our 1
friend 1
expected 1
us 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
mood 1
to 1
laugh 1
and 1
talk 1
with 1
strangers 1
or 1
enter 1
into 1
their 1
feelings 1
or 1
plans 1
with 1
the 1
good 1
humour 1
expected 1
from 1
a 1
guest 1
and 1
accordingly 1
i 1
told 1
clerval 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
tour 1
of 1
scotland 1
alone 1
do 1
you 1
said 1
i 1
enjoy 1
yourself 1
and 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
our 1
rendezvous 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
absent 1
a 1
month 1
or 1
two 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
interfere 1
with 1
my 1
motions 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
solitude 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
return 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
a 1
lighter 1
heart 1
more 1
congenial 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
temper 1
henry 1
wished 1
to 1
dissuade 1
me 1
but 1
seeing 1
me 1
bent 1
on 1
this 1
plan 1
ceased 1
to 1
remonstrate 1
he 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
write 1
often 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
your 1
solitary 1
rambles 1
than 1
with 1
these 1
scotch 1
people 1
whom 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
hasten 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
to 1
return 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
again 1
feel 1
myself 1
somewhat 1
at 1
home 1
which 1
i 1
cannot 1
do 1
in 1
your 1
absence 1
having 1
parted 1
from 1
my 1
friend 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
visit 1
some 1
remote 1
spot 1
of 1
scotland 1
and 1
finish 1
my 1
work 1
in 1
solitude 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
would 1
discover 1
himself 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
finished 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
receive 1
his 1
companion 1
with 1
this 1
resolution 1
i 1
traversed 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
and 1
fixed 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
remotest 1
of 1
the 1
orkneys 1
as 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
fitted 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
work 1
being 1
hardly 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
rock 1
whose 1
high 1
sides 1
were 1
continually 1
beaten 1
upon 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
the 1
soil 1
was 1
barren 1
scarcely 1
affording 1
pasture 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
miserable 1
cows 1
and 1
oatmeal 1
for 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
five 1
persons 1
whose 1
gaunt 1
and 1
scraggy 1
limbs 1
gave 1
tokens 1
of 1
their 1
miserable 1
fare 1
vegetables 1
and 1
bread 1
when 1
they 1
indulged 1
in 1
such 1
luxuries 1
and 1
even 1
fresh 1
water 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
from 1
the 1
mainland 1
which 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
miles 1
distant 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
island 1
there 1
were 1
but 1
three 1
miserable 1
huts 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
vacant 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
this 1
i 1
hired 1
it 1
contained 1
but 1
two 1
rooms 1
and 1
these 1
exhibited 1
all 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
penury 1
the 1
thatch 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
unplastered 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
off 1
its 1
hinges 1
i 1
ordered 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
repaired 1
bought 1
some 1
furniture 1
and 1
took 1
possession 1
an 1
incident 1
which 1
would 1
doubtless 1
have 1
occasioned 1
some 1
surprise 1
had 1
not 1
all 1
the 1
senses 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
been 1
benumbed 1
by 1
want 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
lived 1
ungazed 1
at 1
and 1
unmolested 1
hardly 1
thanked 1
for 1
the 1
pittance 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
clothes 1
which 1
i 1
gave 1
so 1
much 1
does 1
suffering 1
blunt 1
even 1
the 1
coarsest 1
sensations 1
of 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
retreat 1
i 1
devoted 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
labour 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
the 1
weather 1
permitted 1
i 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
stony 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
waves 1
as 1
they 1
roared 1
and 1
dashed 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
monotonous 1
yet 1
everchanging 1
scene 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
switzerland 1
it 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
this 1
desolate 1
and 1
appalling 1
landscape 1
its 1
hills 1
are 1
covered 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1
its 1
cottages 1
are 1
scattered 1
thickly 1
in 1
the 1
plains 1
its 1
fair 1
lakes 1
reflect 1
a 1
blue 1
and 1
gentle 1
sky 1
and 1
when 1
troubled 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
their 1
tumult 1
is 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
play 1
of 1
a 1
lively 1
infant 1
when 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
roarings 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
ocean 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
i 1
distributed 1
my 1
occupations 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
arrived 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
in 1
my 1
labour 1
it 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
horrible 1
and 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
prevail 1
on 1
myself 1
to 1
enter 1
my 1
laboratory 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
and 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
i 1
toiled 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
complete 1
my 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
filthy 1
process 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
during 1
my 1
first 1
experiment 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
frenzy 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
intently 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
labour 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
shut 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
proceedings 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
often 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
thus 1
situated 1
employed 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
detestable 1
occupation 1
immersed 1
in 1
a 1
solitude 1
where 1
nothing 1
could 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
call 1
my 1
attention 1
from 1
the 1
actual 1
scene 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
my 1
spirits 1
became 1
unequal 1
i 1
grew 1
restless 1
and 1
nervous 1
every 1
moment 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
meet 1
my 1
persecutor 1
sometimes 1
i 1
sat 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
fearing 1
to 1
raise 1
them 1
lest 1
they 1
should 1
encounter 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
much 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
wander 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
lest 1
when 1
alone 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
claim 1
his 1
companion 1
in 1
the 1
mean 1
time 1
i 1
worked 1
on 1
and 1
my 1
labour 1
was 1
already 1
considerably 1
advanced 1
i 1
looked 1
towards 1
its 1
completion 1
with 1
a 1
tremulous 1
and 1
eager 1
hope 1
which 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
question 1
but 1
which 1
was 1
intermixed 1
with 1
obscure 1
forebodings 1
of 1
evil 1
that 1
made 1
my 1
heart 1
sicken 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
chapter 1
20 1
i 1
sat 1
one 1
evening 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
set 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
just 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
sufficient 1
light 1
for 1
my 1
employment 1
and 1
i 1
remained 1
idle 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
consideration 1
of 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
labour 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
or 1
hasten 1
its 1
conclusion 1
by 1
an 1
unremitting 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
sat 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
reflection 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
consider 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
doing 1
three 1
years 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
and 1
had 1
created 1
a 1
fiend 1
whose 1
unparalleled 1
barbarity 1
had 1
desolated 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
filled 1
it 1
forever 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
about 1
to 1
form 1
another 1
being 1
of 1
whose 1
dispositions 1
i 1
was 1
alike 1
ignorant 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
ten 1
thousand 1
times 1
more 1
malignant 1
than 1
her 1
mate 1
and 1

for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
in 1
murder 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
he 1
had 1
sworn 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
deserts 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
and 1
she 1
who 1
in 1
all 1
probability 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
thinking 1
and 1
reasoning 1
animal 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
a 1
compact 1
made 1
before 1
her 1
creation 1
they 1
might 1
even 1
hate 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
creature 1
who 1
already 1
lived 1
loathed 1
his 1
own 1
deformity 1
and 1
might 1
he 1
not 1
conceive 1
a 1
greater 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
in 1
the 1
female 1
form 1
she 1
also 1
might 1
turn 1
with 1
disgust 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
superior 1
beauty 1
of 1
man 1
she 1
might 1
quit 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
be 1
again 1
alone 1
exasperated 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
provocation 1
of 1
being 1
deserted 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
species 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
leave 1
europe 1
and 1
inhabit 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
world 1
yet 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
results 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
for 1
which 1
the 1
daemon 1
thirsted 1
would 1
be 1
children 1
and 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
devils 1
would 1
be 1
propagated 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
who 1
might 1
make 1
the 1
very 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
species 1
of 1
man 1
a 1
condition 1
precarious 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
had 1
i 1
right 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
benefit 1
to 1
inflict 1
this 1
curse 1
upon 1
everlasting 1
generations 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
moved 1
by 1
the 1
sophisms 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
struck 1
senseless 1
by 1
his 1
fiendish 1
threats 1
but 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
wickedness 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
burst 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
future 1
ages 1
might 1
curse 1
me 1
as 1
their 1
pest 1
whose 1
selfishness 1
had 1
not 1
hesitated 1
to 1
buy 1
its 1
own 1
peace 1
at 1
the 1
price 1
perhaps 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
i 1
trembled 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
failed 1
within 1
me 1
when 1
on 1
looking 1
up 1
i 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
the 1
daemon 1
at 1
the 1
casement 1
a 1
ghastly 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
on 1
me 1
where 1
i 1
sat 1
fulfilling 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
allotted 1
to 1
me 1
yes 1
he 1
had 1
followed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
travels 1
he 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
forests 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
caves 1
or 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
wide 1
and 1
desert 1
heaths 1
and 1
he 1
now 1
came 1
to 1
mark 1
my 1
progress 1
and 1
claim 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
him 1
his 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
malice 1
and 1
treachery 1
i 1
thought 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
madness 1
on 1
my 1
promise 1
of 1
creating 1
another 1
like 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
trembling 1
with 1
passion 1
tore 1
to 1
pieces 1
the 1
thing 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
the 1
wretch 1
saw 1
me 1
destroy 1
the 1
creature 1
on 1
whose 1
future 1
existence 1
he 1
depended 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
howl 1
of 1
devilish 1
despair 1
and 1
revenge 1
withdrew 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
locking 1
the 1
door 1
made 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
never 1
to 1
resume 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
trembling 1
steps 1
i 1
sought 1
my 1
own 1
apartment 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
none 1
were 1
near 1
me 1
to 1
dissipate 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sickening 1
oppression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
terrible 1
reveries 1
several 1
hours 1
passed 1
and 1
i 1
remained 1
near 1
my 1
window 1
gazing 1
on 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
motionless 1
for 1
the 1
winds 1
were 1
hushed 1
and 1
all 1
nature 1
reposed 1
under 1
the 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
moon 1
a 1
few 1
fishing 1
vessels 1
alone 1
specked 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
wafted 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
as 1
the 1
fishermen 1
called 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
silence 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
its 1
extreme 1
profundity 1
until 1
my 1
ear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
arrested 1
by 1
the 1
paddling 1
of 1
oars 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
a 1
person 1
landed 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
my 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
one 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
softly 1
i 1
trembled 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
rouse 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
who 1
dwelt 1
in 1
a 1
cottage 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
mine 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
helplessness 1
so 1
often 1
felt 1
in 1
frightful 1
dreams 1
when 1
you 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
an 1
impending 1
danger 1
and 1
was 1
rooted 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
presently 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
dreaded 1
appeared 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
smothered 1
voice 1
you 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
you 1
began 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
intend 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
to 1
break 1
your 1
promise 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
toil 1
and 1
misery 1
i 1
left 1
switzerland 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
crept 1
along 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
among 1
its 1
willow 1
islands 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
its 1
hills 1
i 1
have 1
dwelt 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
heaths 1
of 1
england 1
and 1
among 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
scotland 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
incalculable 1
fatigue 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
hunger 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
destroy 1
my 1
hopes 1
begone 1
i 1
do 1
break 1
my 1
promise 1
never 1
will 1
i 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
equal 1
in 1
deformity 1
and 1
wickedness 1
slave 1
i 1
before 1
reasoned 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
proved 1
yourself 1
unworthy 1
of 1
my 1
condescension 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
power 1
you 1
believe 1
yourself 1
miserable 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
wretched 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
will 1
be 1
hateful 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
creator 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
master 1
obey 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
irresolution 1
is 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
your 1
power 1
is 1
arrived 1
your 1
threats 1
cannot 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
wickedness 1
but 1
they 1
confirm 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
determination 1
of 1
not 1
creating 1
you 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
vice 1
shall 1
i 1
in 1
cool 1
blood 1
set 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
a 1
daemon 1
whose 1
delight 1
is 1
in 1
death 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
begone 1
i 1
am 1
firm 1
and 1
your 1
words 1
will 1
only 1
exasperate 1
my 1
rage 1
the 1
monster 1
saw 1
my 1
determination 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
gnashed 1
his 1
teeth 1
in 1
the 1
impotence 1
of 1
anger 1
shall 1
each 1
man 1
cried 1
he 1
find 1
a 1
wife 1
for 1
his 1
bosom 1
and 1
each 1
beast 1
have 1
his 1
mate 1
and 1
i 1
be 1
alone 1
i 1
had 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
requited 1
by 1
detestation 1
and 1
scorn 1
man 1
you 1
may 1
hate 1
but 1
beware 1
your 1
hours 1
will 1
pass 1
in 1
dread 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
bolt 1
will 1
fall 1
which 1
must 1
ravish 1
from 1
you 1
your 1
happiness 1
forever 1
are 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
while 1
i 1
grovel 1
in 1
the 1
intensity 1
of 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
you 1
can 1
blast 1
my 1
other 1
passions 1
but 1
revenge 1
remainsrevenge 1
henceforth 1
dearer 1
than 1
light 1
or 1
food 1
i 1
may 1
die 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
my 1
tyrant 1
and 1
tormentor 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
sun 1
that 1
gazes 1
on 1
your 1
misery 1
beware 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
fearless 1
and 1
therefore 1
powerful 1
i 1
will 1
watch 1
with 1
the 1
wiliness 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
sting 1
with 1
its 1
venom 1
man 1
you 1
shall 1
repent 1
of 1
the 1
injuries 1
you 1
inflict 1
devil 1
cease 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
poison 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
these 1
sounds 1
of 1
malice 1
i 1
have 1
declared 1
my 1
resolution 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
coward 1
to 1
bend 1
beneath 1
words 1
leave 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
inexorable 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
i 1
go 1
but 1
remember 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
weddingnight 1
i 1
started 1
forward 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
villain 1
before 1
you 1
sign 1
my 1
deathwarrant 1
be 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
safe 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
seized 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
precipitation 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
boat 1
which 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
waters 1
with 1
an 1
arrowy 1
swiftness 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
lost 1
amidst 1
the 1
waves 1
all 1
was 1
again 1
silent 1
but 1
his 1
words 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
i 1
burned 1
with 1
rage 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
peace 1
and 1
precipitate 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
i 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
my 1
room 1
hastily 1
and 1
perturbed 1
while 1
my 1
imagination 1
conjured 1
up 1
a 1
thousand 1
images 1
to 1
torment 1
and 1
sting 1
me 1
why 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
followed 1
him 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
strife 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
suffered 1
him 1
to 1
depart 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
directed 1
his 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
mainland 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
victim 1
sacrificed 1
to 1
his 1
insatiate 1
revenge 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
again 1
of 1
his 1
wordsi 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
weddingnight 1
that 1
then 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
destiny 1
in 1
that 1
hour 1
i 1
should 1
die 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
satisfy 1
and 1
extinguish 1
his 1
malice 1
the 1
prospect 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
fear 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
elizabeth 1
of 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
endless 1
sorrow 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
find 1
her 1
lover 1
so 1
barbarously 1
snatched 1
from 1
her 1
tears 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
had 1
shed 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fall 1
before 1
my 1
enemy 1
without 1
a 1
bitter 1
struggle 1
the 1
night 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
ocean 1
my 1
feelings 1
became 1
calmer 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
calmness 1
when 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
rage 1
sinks 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
despair 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
horrid 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
nights 1
contention 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
i 1
almost 1
regarded 1
as 1
an 1
insuperable 1
barrier 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
nay 1
a 1
wish 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
prove 1
the 1
fact 1
stole 1
across 1
me 1
i 1
desired 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
that 1
barren 1
rock 1
wearily 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
uninterrupted 1
by 1
any 1
sudden 1
shock 1
of 1
misery 1
if 1
i 1
returned 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
those 1
whom 1
i 1
most 1
loved 1
die 1
under 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
a 1
daemon 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
myself 1
created 1
i 1
walked 1
about 1
the 1
isle 1
like 1
a 1
restless 1
spectre 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
it 1
loved 1
and 1
miserable 1
in 1
the 1
separation 1
when 1
it 1
became 1
noon 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
higher 1
i 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
was 1
overpowered 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
awake 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
my 1
nerves 1
were 1
agitated 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
inflamed 1
by 1
watching 1
and 1
misery 1
the 1
sleep 1
into 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
sank 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
again 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
like 1
myself 1
and 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
with 1
greater 1
composure 1
yet 1
still 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
like 1
a 1
deathknell 1
they 1
appeared 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
yet 1
distinct 1
and 1
oppressive 1
as 1
a 1
reality 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
far 1
descended 1
and 1
i 1
still 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
satisfying 1
my 1
appetite 1
which 1
had 1
become 1
ravenous 1
with 1
an 1
oaten 1
cake 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
fishingboat 1
land 1
close 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
brought 1
me 1
a 1
packet 1
it 1
contained 1
letters 1
from 1
geneva 1
and 1
one 1
from 1
clerval 1
entreating 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wearing 1
away 1
his 1
time 1
fruitlessly 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
that 1
letters 1
from 1
the 1
friends 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
london 1
desired 1
his 1
return 1
to 1
complete 1
the 1
negotiation 1
they 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
for 1
his 1
indian 1
enterprise 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
delay 1
his 1
departure 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
journey 1
to 1
london 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
even 1
sooner 1
than 1
he 1
now 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
longer 1
voyage 1
he 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
bestow 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
my 1
society 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
spare 1
he 1
besought 1
me 1
therefore 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
solitary 1
isle 1
and 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
perth 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
proceed 1
southwards 1
together 1
this 1
letter 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
quit 1
my 1
island 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
two 1
days 1
yet 1
before 1
i 1
departed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
task 1
to 1
perform 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
reflect 1
i 1
must 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
i 1
must 1
enter 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
work 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
handle 1
those 1
utensils 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
sickening 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
at 1
daybreak 1
i 1
summoned 1
sufficient 1
courage 1
and 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
laboratory 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
halffinished 1
creature 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
destroyed 1
lay 1
scattered 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
i 1
almost 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
mangled 1
the 1
living 1
flesh 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
i 1
paused 1
to 1
collect 1
myself 1
and 1
then 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
with 1
trembling 1
hand 1
i 1
conveyed 1
the 1
instruments 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
relics 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
to 1
excite 1
the 1
horror 1
and 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
and 1
i 1
accordingly 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
basket 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
stones 1
and 1
laying 1
them 1
up 1
determined 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
employed 1
in 1
cleaning 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
chemical 1
apparatus 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
complete 1
than 1
the 1
alteration 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
regarded 1
my 1
promise 1
with 1
a 1
gloomy 1
despair 1
as 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
with 1
whatever 1
consequences 1
must 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
film 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
from 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
saw 1
clearly 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
renewing 1
my 1
labours 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
occur 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
threat 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
weighed 1
on 1
my 1
thoughts 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
a 1
voluntary 1
act 1
of 1
mine 1
could 1
avert 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
resolved 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
to 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
the 1
fiend 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
made 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
the 1
basest 1
and 1
most 1
atrocious 1
selfishness 1
and 1
i 1
banished 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
every 1
thought 1
that 1
could 1
lead 1
to 1
a 1
different 1
conclusion 1
between 1
two 1
and 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
moon 1
rose 1
and 1
i 1
then 1
putting 1
my 1
basket 1
aboard 1
a 1
little 1
skiff 1
sailed 1
out 1
about 1
four 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
perfectly 1
solitary 1
a 1
few 1
boats 1
were 1
returning 1
towards 1
land 1
but 1
i 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
them 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
a 1
dreadful 1
crime 1
and 1
avoided 1
with 1
shuddering 1
anxiety 1
any 1
encounter 1
with 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
the 1
moon 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
clear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
overspread 1
by 1
a 1
thick 1
cloud 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
darkness 1
and 1
cast 1
my 1
basket 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
gurgling 1
sound 1
as 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
then 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
the 1
sky 1
became 1
clouded 1
but 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
pure 1
although 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
northeast 1
breeze 1
that 1
was 1
then 1
rising 1
but 1
it 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
such 1
agreeable 1
sensations 1
that 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
prolong 1
my 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
fixing 1
the 1
rudder 1
in 1
a 1
direct 1
position 1
stretched 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
clouds 1
hid 1
the 1
moon 1
everything 1
was 1
obscure 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
only 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
its 1
keel 1
cut 1
through 1
the 1
waves 1
the 1
murmur 1
lulled 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
i 1
slept 1
soundly 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
situation 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
already 1
mounted 1
considerably 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
high 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
continually 1
threatened 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
skiff 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
northeast 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
driven 1
me 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
coast 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
embarked 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
course 1
but 1
quickly 1
found 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
again 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
the 1
boat 1
would 1
be 1
instantly 1
filled 1
with 1
water 1
thus 1
situated 1
my 1
only 1
resource 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
few 1
sensations 1
of 1
terror 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
compass 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
slenderly 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
geography 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
of 1
little 1
benefit 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
driven 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
atlantic 1
and 1
feel 1
all 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
starvation 1
or 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
immeasurable 1
waters 1
that 1
roared 1
and 1
buffeted 1
around 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
out 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
felt 1
the 1
torment 1
of 1
a 1
burning 1
thirst 1
a 1
prelude 1
to 1
my 1
other 1
sufferings 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
heavens 1
which 1
were 1
covered 1
by 1
clouds 1
that 1
flew 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
replaced 1
by 1
others 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
grave 1
fiend 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
your 1
task 1
is 1
already 1
fulfilled 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
of 1
clervalall 1
left 1
behind 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
monster 1
might 1
satisfy 1
his 1
sanguinary 1
and 1
merciless 1
passions 1
this 1
idea 1
plunged 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
reverie 1
so 1
despairing 1
and 1
frightful 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
scene 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
closing 1
before 1
me 1
forever 1
i 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
it 1
some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
declined 1
towards 1
the 1
horizon 1
the 1
wind 1
died 1
away 1
into 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
became 1
free 1
from 1
breakers 1
but 1
these 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
a 1
heavy 1
swell 1
i 1
felt 1
sick 1
and 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
rudder 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
high 1
land 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
almost 1
spent 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
the 1
dreadful 1
suspense 1
i 1
endured 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
this 1
sudden 1
certainty 1
of 1
life 1
rushed 1
like 1
a 1
flood 1
of 1
warm 1
joy 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
tears 1
gushed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
how 1
mutable 1
are 1
our 1
feelings 1
and 1
how 1
strange 1
is 1
that 1
clinging 1
love 1
we 1
have 1
of 1
life 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
misery 1
i 1
constructed 1
another 1
sail 1
with 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
eagerly 1
steered 1
my 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
land 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
and 1
rocky 1
appearance 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
nearer 1
i 1
easily 1
perceived 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
cultivation 1
i 1
saw 1
vessels 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
suddenly 1
transported 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
civilized 1
man 1
i 1
carefully 1
traced 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
hailed 1
a 1
steeple 1
which 1
i 1
at 1
length 1
saw 1
issuing 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
small 1
promontory 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
extreme 1
debility 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
sail 1
directly 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
most 1
easily 1
procure 1
nourishment 1
fortunately 1
i 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
turned 1
the 1
promontory 1
i 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
neat 1
town 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
harbour 1
which 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
heart 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
at 1
my 1
unexpected 1
escape 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
fixing 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
arranging 1
the 1
sails 1
several 1
people 1
crowded 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
they 1
seemed 1
much 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
appearance 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
offering 1
me 1
any 1
assistance 1
whispered 1
together 1
with 1
gestures 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
other 1
time 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
a 1
slight 1
sensation 1
of 1
alarm 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
merely 1
remarked 1
that 1
they 1
spoke 1
english 1
and 1
i 1
therefore 1
addressed 1
them 1
in 1
that 1
language 1
my 1
good 1
friends 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
you 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
town 1
and 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
soon 1
enough 1
replied 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
maybe 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
that 1
will 1
not 1
prove 1
much 1
to 1
your 1
taste 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
consulted 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
quarters 1
i 1
promise 1
you 1
i 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
surprised 1
on 1
receiving 1
so 1
rude 1
an 1
answer 1
from 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
also 1
disconcerted 1
on 1
perceiving 1
the 1
frowning 1
and 1
angry 1
countenances 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
answer 1
me 1
so 1
roughly 1
i 1
replied 1
surely 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
englishmen 1
to 1
receive 1
strangers 1
so 1
inhospitably 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
what 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
english 1
may 1
be 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
irish 1
to 1
hate 1
villains 1
while 1
this 1
strange 1
dialogue 1
continued 1
i 1
perceived 1
the 1
crowd 1
rapidly 1
increase 1
their 1
faces 1
expressed 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
anger 1
which 1
annoyed 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
alarmed 1
me 1
i 1
inquired 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
replied 1
i 1
then 1
moved 1
forward 1
and 1
a 1
murmuring 1
sound 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
crowd 1
as 1
they 1
followed 1
and 1
surrounded 1
me 1
when 1
an 1
illlooking 1
man 1
approaching 1
tapped 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
come 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
follow 1
me 1
to 1
mr 1
kirwins 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
yourself 1
who 1
is 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
why 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
myself 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
a 1
free 1
country 1
ay 1
sir 1
free 1
enough 1
for 1
honest 1
folks 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
is 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
was 1
found 1
murdered 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
this 1
answer 1
startled 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
presently 1
recovered 1
myself 1
i 1
was 1
innocent 1
that 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
proved 1
accordingly 1
i 1
followed 1
my 1
conductor 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
houses 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
sink 1
from 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
but 1
being 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
crowd 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
politic 1
to 1
rouse 1
all 1
my 1
strength 1
that 1
no 1
physical 1
debility 1
might 1
be 1
construed 1
into 1
apprehension 1
or 1
conscious 1
guilt 1
little 1
did 1
i 1
then 1
expect 1
the 1
calamity 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
me 1
and 1
extinguish 1
in 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
ignominy 1
or 1
death 1
i 1
must 1
pause 1
here 1
for 1
it 1
requires 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
to 1
recall 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
events 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
relate 1
in 1
proper 1
detail 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
chapter 1
21 1
i 1
was 1
soon 1
introduced 1
into 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
an 1
old 1
benevolent 1
man 1
with 1
calm 1
and 1
mild 1
manners 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
me 1
however 1
with 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
severity 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
towards 1
my 1
conductors 1
he 1
asked 1
who 1
appeared 1
as 1
witnesses 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
about 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
men 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
one 1
being 1
selected 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
he 1
deposed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
fishing 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
with 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
brotherinlaw 1
daniel 1
nugent 1
when 1
about 1
ten 1
oclock 1
they 1
observed 1
a 1
strong 1
northerly 1
blast 1
rising 1
and 1
they 1
accordingly 1
put 1
in 1
for 1
port 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
dark 1
night 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
risen 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
land 1
at 1
the 1
harbour 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
at 1
a 1
creek 1
about 1
two 1
miles 1
below 1
he 1
walked 1
on 1
first 1
carrying 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
fishing 1
tackle 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
followed 1
him 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
proceeding 1
along 1
the 1
sands 1
he 1
struck 1
his 1
foot 1
against 1
something 1
and 1
fell 1
at 1
his 1
length 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
his 1
companions 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
their 1
lantern 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
all 1
appearance 1
dead 1
their 1
first 1
supposition 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
some 1
person 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
drowned 1
and 1
was 1
thrown 1
on 1
shore 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
but 1
on 1
examination 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
not 1
wet 1
and 1
even 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
not 1
then 1
cold 1
they 1
instantly 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
life 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
handsome 1
young 1
man 1
about 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
he 1
had 1
apparently 1
been 1
strangled 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
except 1
the 1
black 1
mark 1
of 1
fingers 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
the 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
this 1
deposition 1
did 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
interest 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fingers 1
was 1
mentioned 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
felt 1
myself 1
extremely 1
agitated 1
my 1
limbs 1
trembled 1
and 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
obliged 1
me 1
to 1
lean 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
for 1
support 1
the 1
magistrate 1
observed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
keen 1
eye 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
drew 1
an 1
unfavourable 1
augury 1
from 1
my 1
manner 1
the 1
son 1
confirmed 1
his 1
fathers 1
account 1
but 1
when 1
daniel 1
nugent 1
was 1
called 1
he 1
swore 1
positively 1
that 1
just 1
before 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
his 1
companion 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
judge 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
stars 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
landed 1
a 1
woman 1
deposed 1
that 1
she 1
lived 1
near 1
the 1
beach 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
her 1
cottage 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
push 1
off 1
from 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
shore 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
was 1
afterwards 1
found 1
another 1
woman 1
confirmed 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
having 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
into 1
her 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
cold 1
they 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
daniel 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
an 1
apothecary 1
but 1
life 1
was 1
quite 1
gone 1
several 1
other 1
men 1
were 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
landing 1
and 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
strong 1
north 1
wind 1
that 1
had 1
arisen 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
beaten 1
about 1
for 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
obliged 1
to 1
return 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
departed 1
besides 1
they 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
appeared 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
from 1
another 1
place 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
likely 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
shore 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
the 1
harbour 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
deposited 1
the 1
corpse 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
evidence 1
desired 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
lay 1
for 1
interment 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
observed 1
what 1
effect 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
produce 1
upon 1
me 1
this 1
idea 1
was 1
probably 1
suggested 1
by 1
the 1
extreme 1
agitation 1
i 1
had 1
exhibited 1
when 1
the 1
mode 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
described 1
i 1
was 1
accordingly 1
conducted 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
several 1
other 1
persons 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
this 1
eventful 1
night 1
but 1
knowing 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
conversing 1
with 1
several 1
persons 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
had 1
inhabited 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
i 1
was 1
perfectly 1
tranquil 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
lay 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
coffin 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
describe 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
beholding 1
it 1
i 1
feel 1
yet 1
parched 1
with 1
horror 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
reflect 1
on 1
that 1
terrible 1
moment 1
without 1
shuddering 1
and 1
agony 1
the 1
examination 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
witnesses 1
passed 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
from 1
my 1
memory 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
henry 1
clerval 1
stretched 1
before 1
me 1
i 1
gasped 1
for 1
breath 1
and 1
throwing 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
have 1
my 1
murderous 1
machinations 1
deprived 1
you 1
also 1
my 1
dearest 1
henry 1
of 1
life 1
two 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
destroyed 1
other 1
victims 1
await 1
their 1
destiny 1
but 1
you 1
clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
my 1
benefactor 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
support 1
the 1
agonies 1
that 1
i 1
endured 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
strong 1
convulsions 1
a 1
fever 1
succeeded 1
to 1
this 1
i 1
lay 1
for 1
two 1
months 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
my 1
ravings 1
as 1
i 1
afterwards 1
heard 1
were 1
frightful 1
i 1
called 1
myself 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
william 1
of 1
justine 1
and 1
of 1
clerval 1
sometimes 1
i 1
entreated 1
my 1
attendants 1
to 1
assist 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
by 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
tormented 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
fingers 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
already 1
grasping 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
screamed 1
aloud 1
with 1
agony 1
and 1
terror 1
fortunately 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
my 1
native 1
language 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
alone 1
understood 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
gestures 1
and 1
bitter 1
cries 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
affright 1
the 1
other 1
witnesses 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
die 1
more 1
miserable 1
than 1
man 1
ever 1
was 1
before 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
sink 1
into 1
forgetfulness 1
and 1
rest 1
death 1
snatches 1
away 1
many 1
blooming 1
children 1
the 1
only 1
hopes 1
of 1
their 1
doting 1
parents 1
how 1
many 1
brides 1
and 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
a 1
prey 1
for 1
worms 1
and 1
the 1
decay 1
of 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
what 1
materials 1
was 1
i 1
made 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
thus 1
resist 1
so 1
many 1
shocks 1
which 1
like 1
the 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
wheel 1
continually 1
renewed 1
the 1
torture 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
found 1
myself 1
as 1
awaking 1
from 1
a 1
dream 1
in 1
a 1
prison 1
stretched 1
on 1
a 1
wretched 1
bed 1
surrounded 1
by 1
jailers 1
turnkeys 1
bolts 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
miserable 1
apparatus 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
i 1
remember 1
when 1
i 1
thus 1
awoke 1
to 1
understanding 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
only 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
great 1
misfortune 1
had 1
suddenly 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
around 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
flashed 1
across 1
my 1
memory 1
and 1
i 1
groaned 1
bitterly 1
this 1
sound 1
disturbed 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
was 1
sleeping 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
beside 1
me 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
hired 1
nurse 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
turnkeys 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
all 1
those 1
bad 1
qualities 1
which 1
often 1
characterize 1
that 1
class 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
were 1
hard 1
and 1
rude 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
persons 1
accustomed 1
to 1
see 1
without 1
sympathizing 1
in 1
sights 1
of 1
misery 1
her 1
tone 1
expressed 1
her 1
entire 1
indifference 1
she 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
english 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
one 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
during 1
my 1
sufferings 1
are 1
you 1
better 1
now 1
sir 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
language 1
with 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
am 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
all 1
true 1
if 1
indeed 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
alive 1
to 1
feel 1
this 1
misery 1
and 1
horror 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
replied 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
if 1
you 1
mean 1
about 1
the 1
gentleman 1
you 1
murdered 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
were 1
better 1
for 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
dead 1
for 1
i 1
fancy 1
it 1
will 1
go 1
hard 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
thats 1
none 1
of 1
my 1
business 1
i 1
am 1
sent 1
to 1
nurse 1
you 1
and 1
get 1
you 1
well 1
i 1
do 1
my 1
duty 1
with 1
a 1
safe 1
conscience 1
it 1
were 1
well 1
if 1
everybody 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
turned 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
utter 1
so 1
unfeeling 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
just 1
saved 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
edge 1
of 1
death 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
languid 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
whole 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
i 1
sometimes 1
doubted 1
if 1
indeed 1
it 1
were 1
all 1
true 1
for 1
it 1
never 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
reality 1
as 1
the 1
images 1
that 1
floated 1
before 1
me 1
became 1
more 1
distinct 1
i 1
grew 1
feverish 1
a 1
darkness 1
pressed 1
around 1
me 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
near 1
me 1
who 1
soothed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
gentle 1
voice 1
of 1
love 1
no 1
dear 1
hand 1
supported 1
me 1
the 1
physician 1
came 1
and 1
prescribed 1
medicines 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
prepared 1
them 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
utter 1
carelessness 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
brutality 1
was 1
strongly 1
marked 1
in 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
who 1
could 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
but 1
the 1
hangman 1
who 1
would 1
gain 1
his 1
fee 1
these 1
were 1
my 1
first 1
reflections 1
but 1
i 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
had 1
shown 1
me 1
extreme 1
kindness 1
he 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
best 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
prison 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
wretched 1
indeed 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
a 1
physician 1
and 1
a 1
nurse 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
he 1
seldom 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
for 1
although 1
he 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
relieve 1
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
every 1
human 1
creature 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
agonies 1
and 1
miserable 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
he 1
came 1
therefore 1
sometimes 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
neglected 1
but 1
his 1
visits 1
were 1
short 1
and 1
with 1
long 1
intervals 1
one 1
day 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
gradually 1
recovering 1
i 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
my 1
eyes 1
half 1
open 1
and 1
my 1
cheeks 1
livid 1
like 1
those 1
in 1
death 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
gloom 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
often 1
reflected 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
seek 1
death 1
than 1
desire 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
a 1
world 1
which 1
to 1
me 1
was 1
replete 1
with 1
wretchedness 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
i 1
considered 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
declare 1
myself 1
guilty 1
and 1
suffer 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
less 1
innocent 1
than 1
poor 1
justine 1
had 1
been 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
thoughts 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
apartment 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
entered 1
his 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
chair 1
close 1
to 1
mine 1
and 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
french 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
very 1
shocking 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
more 1
comfortable 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
mention 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
earth 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
comfort 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
can 1
be 1
but 1
of 1
little 1
relief 1
to 1
one 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
misfortune 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
i 1
