that 1
night 1
tom 1
and 1
huck 1
were 1
ready 1
for 1
their 1
adventure 1
they 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1
tavern 1
until 1
after 1
nine 1
one 1
watching 1
the 1
alley 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
tavern 1
door 1
nobody 1
entered 1
the 1
alley 1
or 1
left 1
it 1
nobody 1
resembling 1
the 1
spaniard 1
entered 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
tavern 1
door 1
the 1
night 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
fair 1
one 1
so 1
tom 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
the 1
understanding 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
considerable 1
degree 1
of 1
darkness 1
came 1
on 1
huck 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
maow 1
whereupon 1
he 1
would 1
slip 1
out 1
and 1
try 1
the 1
keys 1
but 1
the 1
night 1
remained 1
clear 1
and 1
huck 1
closed 1
his 1
watch 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
bed 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
sugar 1
hogshead 1
about 1
twelve 1
tuesday 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
ill 1
luck 1
also 1
wednesday 1
but 1
thursday 1
night 1
promised 1
better 1
tom 1
slipped 1
out 1
in 1
good 1
season 1
with 1
his 1
aunts 1
old 1
tin 1
lantern 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
towel 1
to 1
blindfold 1
it 1
with 1
he 1
hid 1
the 1
lantern 1
in 1
hucks 1
sugar 1
hogshead 1
and 1
the 1
watch 1
began 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
midnight 1
the 1
tavern 1
closed 1
up 1
and 1
its 1
lights 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1
thereabouts 1
were 1
put 1
out 1
no 1
spaniard 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
nobody 1
had 1
entered 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
alley 1
everything 1
was 1
auspicious 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
darkness 1
reigned 1
the 1
perfect 1
stillness 1
was 1
interrupted 1
only 1
by 1
occasional 1
mutterings 1
of 1
distant 1
thunder 1
tom 1
got 1
his 1
lantern 1
lit 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
hogshead 1
wrapped 1
it 1
closely 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
adventurers 1
crept 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
toward 1
the 1
tavern 1
huck 1
stood 1
sentry 1
and 1
tom 1
felt 1
his 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
alley 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
season 1
of 1
waiting 1
anxiety 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
hucks 1
spirits 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
wish 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
flash 1
from 1
the 1
lanternit 1
would 1
frighten 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
at 1
least 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
tom 1
was 1
alive 1
yet 1
it 1
seemed 1
hours 1
since 1
tom 1
had 1
disappeared 1
surely 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
fainted 1
maybe 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
maybe 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
burst 1
under 1
terror 1
and 1
excitement 1
in 1
his 1
uneasiness 1
huck 1
found 1
himself 1
drawing 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
alley 1
fearing 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
dreadful 1
things 1
and 1
momentarily 1
expecting 1
some 1
catastrophe 1
to 1
happen 1
that 1
would 1
take 1
away 1
his 1
breath 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
for 1
he 1
seemed 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
inhale 1
it 1
by 1
thimblefuls 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
would 1
soon 1
wear 1
itself 1
out 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
beating 1
suddenly 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
light 1
and 1
tom 1
came 1
tearing 1
by 1
him 1
run 1
said 1
he 1
run 1
for 1
your 1
life 1
he 1
neednt 1
have 1
repeated 1
it 1
once 1
was 1
enough 1
huck 1
was 1
making 1
thirty 1
or 1
forty 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
repetition 1
was 1
uttered 1
the 1
boys 1
never 1
stopped 1
till 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
shed 1
of 1
a 1
deserted 1
slaughterhouse 1
at 1
the 1
lower 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
got 1
within 1
its 1
shelter 1
the 1
storm 1
burst 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
tom 1
got 1
his 1
breath 1
he 1
said 1
huck 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
i 1
tried 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
keys 1
just 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
racket 1
that 1
i 1
couldnt 1
hardly 1
get 1
my 1
breath 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
scared 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
either 1
well 1
without 1
noticing 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1

took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
knob 1
and 1
open 1

chapter 1
xxix 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
tom 1
heard 1
on 1
friday 1
morning 1
was 1
a 1
glad 1
piece 1
of 1
newsjudge 1
thatchers 1
family 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
both 1
injun 1
joe 1
and 1
the 1
treasure 1
sunk 1
into 1
secondary 1
importance 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
becky 1
took 1
the 1
chief 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
boys 1
interest 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
an 1
exhausting 1
good 1
time 1
playing 1
hispy 1
and 1
gullykeeper 1
with 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
their 1
schoolmates 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
completed 1
and 1
crowned 1
in 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
satisfactory 1
way 1
becky 1
teased 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
appoint 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
longpromised 1
and 1
longdelayed 1
picnic 1
and 1
she 1
consented 1
the 1
childs 1
delight 1
was 1
boundless 1
and 1
toms 1
not 1
more 1
moderate 1
the 1
invitations 1
were 1
sent 1
out 1
before 1
sunset 1
and 1
straightway 1
the 1
young 1
folks 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
were 1
thrown 1
into 1
a 1
fever 1
of 1
preparation 1
and 1
pleasurable 1
anticipation 1
toms 1
excitement 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
until 1
a 1
pretty 1
late 1
hour 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
good 1
hopes 1
of 1
hearing 1
hucks 1
maow 1
and 1
of 1
having 1
his 1
treasure 1
to 1
astonish 1
becky 1
and 1
the 1
picnickers 1
with 1
next 1
day 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
disappointed 1
no 1
signal 1
came 1
that 1
night 1
morning 1
came 1
eventually 1
and 1
by 1
ten 1
or 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
a 1
giddy 1
and 1
rollicking 1
company 1
were 1
gathered 1
at 1
judge 1
thatchers 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
for 1
a 1
start 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
custom 1
for 1
elderly 1
people 1
to 1
mar 1
the 1
picnics 1
with 1
their 1
presence 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
considered 1
safe 1
enough 1
under 1
the 1
wings 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
young 1
ladies 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
young 1
gentlemen 1
of 1
twentythree 1
or 1
thereabouts 1
the 1
old 1
steam 1
ferryboat 1
was 1
chartered 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
presently 1
the 1
gay 1
throng 1
filed 1
up 1
the 1
main 1
street 1
laden 1
with 1
provisionbaskets 1
sid 1
was 1
sick 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
fun 1

remained 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
entertain 1
him 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
said 1
to 1
becky 1
was 1
youll 1
not 1
get 1
back 1
till 1
late 1
perhaps 1
youd 1
better 1
stay 1
all 1
night 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
girls 1
that 1
live 1
near 1
the 1
ferrylanding 1

splendid 1
hospitality 1
was 1
a 1
tempting 1
bait 1
it 1
and 1
toms 1
persuasions 1
presently 1
carried 1
the 1
day 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
decided 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
anybody 1
about 1
the 1
nights 1
programme 1
presently 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
tom 1
that 1
maybe 1
huck 1
might 1
come 1
this 1
very 1
night 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
signal 1
the 1
thought 1
took 1
a 1
deal 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
anticipations 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
fun 1
at 1
widow 1
douglas 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
he 1
reasonedthe 1
signal 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
so 1
why 1
should 1
it 1
be 1
any 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
come 1
tonight 1
the 1
sure 1
fun 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
outweighed 1
the 1
uncertain 1
treasure 1
and 1
boylike 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
the 1
stronger 1
inclination 1
and 1
not 1
allow 1
himself 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
of 1
money 1
another 1
time 1
that 1
day 1
three 1
miles 1
below 1
town 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
woody 1
hollow 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
crowd 1
swarmed 1
ashore 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
forest 1
distances 1
and 1
craggy 1
heights 1
echoed 1
far 1
and 1
near 1
with 1
shoutings 1
and 1
laughter 1
all 1
the 1
different 1
ways 1
of 1
getting 1
hot 1
and 1
tired 1
were 1
gone 1
through 1
with 1
and 1
byandby 1
the 1
rovers 1
straggled 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
fortified 1
with 1
responsible 1
appetites 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
things 1
began 1
after 1
the 1
feast 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
refreshing 1
season 1
of 1
rest 1
and 1
chat 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
spreading 1
oaks 1
byandby 1
somebody 1
shouted 1
whos 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
cave 1
everybody 1
was 1
bundles 1
of 1
candles 1
were 1
procured 1
and 1
straightway 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
general 1
scamper 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
was 1
up 1
the 1
hillsidean 1
opening 1
shaped 1
like 1
a 1
letter 1
a 1
its 1
massive 1
oaken 1
door 1
stood 1
unbarred 1
within 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
chamber 1
chilly 1
as 1
an 1
icehouse 1
and 1
walled 1
by 1
nature 1
with 1
solid 1
limestone 1
that 1
was 1
dewy 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
sweat 1
it 1
was 1
romantic 1
and 1
mysterious 1
to 1
stand 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
gloom 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
green 1
valley 1
shining 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
but 1
the 1
impressiveness 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
quickly 1
wore 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
romping 1
began 1
again 1
the 1
moment 1
a 1
candle 1
was 1
lighted 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
general 1
rush 1
upon 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
struggle 1
and 1
a 1
gallant 1
defence 1
followed 1
but 1
the 1
candle 1
was 1
soon 1
knocked 1
down 1
or 1
blown 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
glad 1
clamor 1
of 1
laughter 1
and 1
a 1
new 1
chase 1
but 1
all 1
things 1
have 1
an 1
end 1
byandby 1
the 1
procession 1
went 1
filing 1
down 1
the 1
steep 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
avenue 1
the 1
flickering 1
rank 1
of 1
lights 1
dimly 1
revealing 1
the 1
lofty 1
walls 1
of 1
rock 1
almost 1
to 1
their 1
point 1
of 1
junction 1
sixty 1
feet 1
overhead 1
this 1
main 1
avenue 1
was 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
eight 1
or 1
ten 1
feet 1
wide 1
every 1
few 1
steps 1
other 1
lofty 1
and 1
still 1
narrower 1
crevices 1
branched 1
from 1
it 1
on 1
either 1
handfor 1
mcdougals 1
cave 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
vast 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
crooked 1
aisles 1
that 1
ran 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
led 1
nowhere 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
one 1
might 1
wander 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
together 1
through 1
its 1
intricate 1
tangle 1
of 1
rifts 1
and 1
chasms 1
and 1
never 1
find 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
down 1
and 1
still 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
samelabyrinth 1
under 1
labyrinth 1
and 1
no 1
end 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
no 1
man 1
knew 1
the 1
cave 1
that 1
was 1
an 1
impossible 1
thing 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
knew 1
a 1
portion 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
customary 1
to 1
venture 1
much 1
beyond 1
this 1
known 1
portion 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
knew 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
the 1
procession 1
moved 1
along 1
the 1
main 1
avenue 1
some 1
threequarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
then 1
groups 1
and 1
couples 1
began 1
to 1
slip 1
aside 1
into 1
branch 1
avenues 1
fly 1
along 1
the 1
dismal 1
corridors 1
and 1
take 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
surprise 1
at 1
points 1
where 1
the 1
corridors 1
joined 1
again 1
parties 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
elude 1
each 1
other 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
without 1
going 1
beyond 1
the 1
known 1
ground 1
byandby 1
one 1
group 1
after 1
another 1
came 1
straggling 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
panting 1
hilarious 1
smeared 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
with 1
tallow 1
drippings 1
daubed 1
with 1
clay 1
and 1
entirely 1
delighted 1
with 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
then 1
they 1
were 1
astonished 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
taking 1
no 1
note 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
was 1
about 1
at 1
hand 1
the 1
clanging 1
bell 1
had 1
been 1
calling 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
however 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
days 1
adventures 1
was 1
romantic 1
and 1
therefore 1
satisfactory 1
when 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
with 1
her 1
wild 1
freight 1
pushed 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
nobody 1
cared 1
sixpence 1
for 1
the 1
wasted 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
captain 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
huck 1
was 1
already 1
upon 1
his 1
watch 1
when 1
the 1
ferryboats 1
lights 1
went 1
glinting 1
past 1
the 1
wharf 1
he 1
heard 1
no 1
noise 1
on 1
board 1
for 1
the 1
young 1
people 1
were 1
as 1
subdued 1
and 1
still 1
as 1
people 1
usually 1
are 1
who 1
are 1
nearly 1
tired 1
to 1
death 1
he 1
wondered 1
what 1
boat 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
why 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
at 1
the 1
wharfand 1
then 1
he 1
dropped 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
attention 1
upon 1
his 1
business 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
growing 1
cloudy 1
and 1
dark 1
ten 1
oclock 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
vehicles 1
ceased 1
scattered 1
lights 1
began 1
to 1
wink 1
out 1
all 1
straggling 1
footpassengers 1
disappeared 1
the 1
village 1
betook 1
itself 1
to 1
its 1
slumbers 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
small 1
watcher 1
alone 1
with 1
the 1
silence 1
and 1
the 1
ghosts 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
tavern 1
lights 1
were 1
put 1
out 1
darkness 1
everywhere 1
now 1
huck 1
waited 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
weary 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
nothing 1
happened 1
his 1
faith 1
was 1
weakening 1
was 1
there 1
any 1
use 1
was 1
there 1
really 1
any 1
use 1
why 1
not 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
turn 1
in 1
a 1
noise 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
ear 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
attention 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
alley 1
door 1
closed 1
softly 1
he 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
brick 1
store 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
two 1
men 1
brushed 1
by 1
him 1
and 1
one 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
that 1
box 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
treasure 1
why 1
call 1
tom 1
now 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
absurdthe 1
men 1
would 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
never 1
be 1
found 1
again 1
no 1
he 1
would 1
stick 1
to 1
their 1
wake 1
and 1
follow 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
trust 1
to 1
the 1
darkness 1
for 1
security 1
from 1
discovery 1
so 1
communing 1
with 1
himself 1
huck 1
stepped 1
out 1
and 1
glided 1
along 1
behind 1
the 1
men 1
catlike 1
with 1
bare 1
feet 1
allowing 1
them 1
to 1
keep 1
just 1
far 1
enough 1
ahead 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
invisible 1
they 1
moved 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
street 1
three 1
blocks 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
up 1
a 1
crossstreet 1
they 1
went 1
straight 1
ahead 1
then 1
until 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
path 1
that 1
led 1
up 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
this 1
they 1
took 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
welshmans 1
house 1
halfway 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
without 1
hesitating 1
and 1
still 1
climbed 1
upward 1
good 1
thought 1
huck 1
they 1
will 1
bury 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
quarry 1
but 1
they 1
never 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
quarry 1
they 1
passed 1
on 1
up 1
the 1
summit 1
they 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
narrow 1
path 1
between 1
the 1
tall 1
sumach 1
bushes 1
and 1
were 1
at 1
once 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
huck 1
closed 1
up 1
and 1
shortened 1
his 1
distance 1
now 1
for 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
trotted 1
along 1
awhile 1
then 1
slackened 1
his 1
pace 1
fearing 1
he 1
was 1
gaining 1
too 1
fast 1
moved 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
then 1
stopped 1
altogether 1
listened 1
no 1
sound 1
none 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
beating 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
heart 1
the 1
hooting 1
of 1
an 1
owl 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
hillominous 1
sound 1
but 1
no 1
footsteps 1
heavens 1
was 1
everything 1
lost 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
spring 1
with 1
winged 1
feet 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
cleared 1
his 1
throat 1
not 1
four 1
feet 1
from 1
him 1
hucks 1
heart 1
shot 1
into 1
his 1
throat 1
but 1
he 1
swallowed 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
shaking 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
dozen 1
agues 1
had 1
taken 1
charge 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
so 1
weak 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
must 1
surely 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
he 1
knew 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
within 1
five 1
steps 1
of 1
the 1
stile 1
leading 1
into 1
widow 1
douglas 1
grounds 1
very 1
well 1
he 1
thought 1
let 1
them 1
bury 1
it 1
there 1
it 1
wont 1
be 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
now 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
voicea 1
very 1
low 1
voiceinjun 1
joes 1
damn 1
her 1
maybe 1
shes 1
got 1
companytheres 1
lights 1

that 1
strangers 1

stranger 1
of 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
a 1
deadly 1
chill 1
went 1
to 1
hucks 1
heartthis 1
then 1
was 1
the 1
revenge 1
job 1
his 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
fly 1
then 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
had 1
been 1
kind 1
to 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
and 1
maybe 1
these 1
men 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
murder 1
her 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
dared 1
venture 1
to 1
warn 1
her 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1

didnt 1
darethey 1

come 1
and 1

he 1
thought 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
elapsed 1
between 1
the 1
strangers 1

and 1

no 1
hurry 1
huck 1
felt 1
that 1
a 1
silence 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
ensuea 1
thing 1
still 1
more 1
awful 1
than 1
any 1
amount 1
of 1
murderous 1
talk 1
so 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
stepped 1
gingerly 1
back 1
planted 1
his 1
foot 1
carefully 1
and 1
firmly 1
after 1
balancing 1
onelegged 1
in 1
a 1
precarious 1
way 1
and 1
almost 1
toppling 1
over 1
first 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
step 1
back 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
elaboration 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
risks 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
anda 1
twig 1
snapped 1
under 1
his 1
foot 1
his 1
breath 1
stopped 1
and 1
he 1
listened 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
soundthe 1
stillness 1
was 1
perfect 1
his 1
gratitude 1
was 1
measureless 1
now 1
he 1
turned 1
in 1
his 1
tracks 1
between 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
sumach 1
bushesturned 1
himself 1
as 1
carefully 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
a 1
shipand 1
then 1
stepped 1
quickly 1
but 1
cautiously 1
along 1
when 1
he 1
emerged 1
at 1
the 1
quarry 1
he 1
felt 1
secure 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
his 1
nimble 1
heels 1
and 1
flew 1
down 1
down 1
he 1
sped 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
welshmans 1
he 1
banged 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
stalwart 1
sons 1

up 1
the 1

their 1
weapons 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1

hid 1
behind 1
a 1
great 1
bowlder 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
listening 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
lagging 1
anxious 1
silence 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
explosion 1
of 1
firearms 1
and 1
a 1
cry 1
huck 1
waited 1
for 1
no 1
particulars 1
he 1
sprang 1
away 1
and 1
sped 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
his 1
legs 1
could 1
carry 1

groping 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
rapped 1
gently 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
welshmans 1
door 1
the 1
inmates 1
were 1
asleep 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sleep 1
that 1
was 1
set 1
on 1
a 1
hairtrigger 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
exciting 1
episode 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
a 1
call 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
window 1

pleasantest 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1

could 1
not 1
recollect 1
that 1
the 1
closing 1
word 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
applied 1
in 1
his 1
case 1
before 1

quickly 1
unlocked 1
and 1
he 1
entered 1
huck 1

given 1
a 1
seat 1
and 1
the 1

knew 1
right 1
where 1
to 1
put 1
our 1
hands 1
on 1
them 1
by 1
your 1
description 1
so 1
we 1
crept 1
along 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
within 1
fifteen 1
feet 1
of 1
themdark 1
as 1
a 1
cellar 1
that 1
sumach 1
path 1
wasand 1
just 1
then 1
i 1
found 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
sneeze 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
meanest 1
kind 1
of 1
luck 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
back 1
but 1
no 1
usetwas 1
bound 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
come 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
with 1
my 1
pistol 1
raised 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
sneeze 1
started 1
those 1
scoundrels 1
arustling 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
path 1
i 1
sung 1
out 1
fire 1
boys 1
and 1
blazed 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
rustling 1
was 1
so 1
did 1
the 1
boys 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
jiffy 1
those 1
villains 1
and 1
we 1
after 1
them 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
i 1
judge 1
we 1
never 1
touched 1
them 1
they 1
fired 1
a 1
shot 1
apiece 1
as 1
they 1
started 1
but 1
their 1
bullets 1
whizzed 1
by 1
and 1
didnt 1
do 1
us 1
any 1
harm 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
lost 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
their 1
feet 1
we 1
quit 1
chasing 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
constables 1
they 1
got 1
a 1
posse 1
together 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
guard 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
light 1
the 1
sheriff 1
and 1
a 1
gang 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
beat 1
up 1
the 1
woods 1

already 1
knew 1
too 1
much 1
about 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
men 1
and 1

looking 1
suspicious 1
huck 1
was 1
silent 1
while 1
he 1
framed 1
a 1
duly 1
cautious 1
reply 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
well 1

kind 1
of 1
a 1
hard 1
lotleast 1
everybody 1

i 1
dont 1
see 1
nothing 1
agin 1
itand 1
sometimes 1
i 1
cant 1
sleep 1
much 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
thinking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
sort 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
strike 1
out 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
of 1
doing 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
couldnt 1
sleep 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
come 1
along 1
upstreet 1
bout 1
midnight 1
aturning 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
old 1
shackly 1
brick 1
store 1
by 1
the 1
temperance 1
tavern 1
i 1
backed 1
up 1
agin 1
the 1
wall 1
to 1
have 1
another 1
think 1
well 1
just 1
then 1
along 1
comes 1
these 1
two 1
chaps 1
slipping 1
along 1
close 1
by 1
me 1
with 1
something 1
under 1
their 1
arm 1
and 1
i 1
reckoned 1
theyd 1
stole 1
it 1
one 1
was 1
asmoking 1
and 1
tother 1
one 1
wanted 1
a 1
light 1
so 1
they 1
stopped 1
right 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
cigars 1
lit 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
big 1
one 1
was 1
the 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
spaniard 1
by 1
his 1
white 1
whiskers 1
and 1
the 1
patch 1
on 1
his 1
eye 1
and 1
tother 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
rusty 1
raggedlooking 1
devil 1
could 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
rags 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
cigars 1
this 1
staggered 1
huck 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
well 1
i 1
dont 1
knowbut 1
somehow 1
it 1
seems 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
you 1
follered 1
emyes 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
upthey 1
sneaked 1
along 1
so 1
i 1
dogged 1
em 1
to 1
the 1
widders 1
stile 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
ragged 1
one 1
beg 1
for 1
the 1
widder 1
and 1
the 1
spaniard 1
swear 1
hed 1
spile 1
her 1
looks 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
what 1
the 1
_deaf 1
and 1
dumb_ 1
man 1
said 1
all 1
that 1
huck 1
had 1
made 1
another 1
terrible 1
mistake 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
his 1
best 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
from 1
getting 1
the 1
faintest 1
hint 1
of 1
who 1
the 1
spaniard 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
tongue 1
seemed 1
determined 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
into 1
trouble 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
he 1
made 1
several 1
efforts 1
to 1
creep 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
scrape 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
mans 1
eye 1
was 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
blunder 1
after 1
blunder 1
presently 1
the 1
welshman 1
said 1
my 1
boy 1
dont 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
hurt 1

hair 1
of 1

slip 1
without 1
intending 1
it 1
you 1
cant 1
cover 1
that 1
up 1

something 1
about 1
that 1
spaniard 1
that 1

me 1
what 1
it 1

and 1

you 1
huck 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
old 1
mans 1
honest 1
eyes 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
bent 1
over 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
taint 1
a 1
spaniardits 1
injun 1
joe 1
the 1
welshman 1
almost 1
jumped 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
said 1
its 1
all 1
plain 1
enough 1
now 1
when 1
you 1
talked 1
about 1
notching 1
ears 1
and 1
slitting 1
noses 1
i 1
judged 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
your 1
own 1
embellishment 1
because 1
white 1
men 1
dont 1
take 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
revenge 1
but 1
an 1
injun 1
thats 1
a 1
different 1
matter 1
altogether 1
during 1
breakfast 1
the 1
talk 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
sons 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
bed 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
lantern 1
and 1
examine 1
the 1
stile 1
and 1
its 1
vicinity 1
for 1
marks 1
of 1
blood 1
they 1
found 1
none 1
but 1
captured 1
a 1
bulky 1
bundle 1
of 1
of 1
_what_ 1
if 1
the 1
words 1
had 1
been 1
lightning 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
leaped 1
with 1
a 1
more 1
stunning 1
suddenness 1
from 1
hucks 1
blanched 1
lips 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
staring 1
wide 1
now 1
and 1
his 1
breath 1
suspendedwaiting 1
for 1
the 1
answer 1
the 1
welshman 1

whats 1
the 1
_matter_ 1
with 1
you 1
huck 1
sank 1
back 1
panting 1
gently 1
but 1
deeply 1
unutterably 1
grateful 1
the 1
welshman 1
eyed 1
him 1
gravely 1
curiouslyand 1
presently 1
said 1
yes 1
burglars 1
tools 1
that 1
appears 1
to 1
relieve 1
you 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
but 1
what 1
did 1
give 1
you 1
that 1
turn 1
what 1
were 1

was 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
weigh 1
it 1
so 1
at 1
a 1
venture 1
he 1
uttered 1
itfeebly 1
sundayschool 1
books 1
maybe 1
poor 1
huck 1
was 1
too 1
distressed 1
to 1
smile 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
laughed 1
loud 1
and 1
joyously 1
shook 1
up 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
anatomy 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
ended 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
laugh 1
was 1
money 1
in 1
amans 1
pocket 1
because 1
it 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
doctors 1
bill 1
like 1
everything 1
then 1
he 1
added 1
poor 1
old 1
chap 1
youre 1
white 1
and 1
jadedyou 1
aint 1
well 1
a 1
bitno 1
wonder 1
youre 1
a 1
little 1
flighty 1
and 1
off 1
your 1
balance 1
but 1
youll 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
rest 1
and 1
sleep 1
will 1
fetch 1
you 1
out 1
all 1
right 1
i 1
hope 1
huck 1
was 1
irritated 1
to 1
think 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
such 1
a 1
goose 1
and 1
betrayed 1
such 1
a 1
suspicious 1
excitement 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
parcel 1
brought 1
from 1
the 1
tavern 1
was 1
the 1
treasure 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
talk 1
at 1
the 1
widows 1
stile 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
treasure 1
howeverhe 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
that 1
it 1
wasntand 1
so 1
the 1
suggestion 1
of 1
a 1
captured 1
bundle 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
his 1
selfpossession 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
he 1
felt 1
glad 1
the 1
little 1
episode 1
had 1
happened 1
for 1
now 1
he 1
knew 1
beyond 1
all 1
question 1
that 1
that 1
bundle 1
was 1
not 1
_the_ 1
bundle 1
and 1
so 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
at 1
rest 1
and 1
exceedingly 1
comfortable 1
in 1
fact 1
everything 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
drifting 1
just 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
direction 1
now 1
the 1
treasure 1
must 1
be 1
still 1
in 1
no 1
2 1
the 1
men 1
would 1
be 1
captured 1
and 1
jailed 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
tom 1
could 1
seize 1
the 1
gold 1
that 1
night 1
without 1
any 1
trouble 1
or 1
any 1
fear 1
of 1
interruption 1
just 1
as 1
breakfast 1
was 1
completed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
huck 1
jumped 1
for 1
a 1
hidingplace 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
connected 1
even 1
remotely 1
with 1
the 1
late 1
event 1
the 1
welshman 1
admitted 1
several 1
ladies 1
and 1
gentlemen 1
among 1
them 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
and 1
noticed 1
that 1
groups 1
of 1
citizens 1
were 1
climbing 1
up 1
the 1
hillto 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
stile 1
so 1
the 1
news 1
had 1
spread 1
the 1
welshman 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
visitors 1
the 1
widows 1
gratitude 1
for 1
her 1
preservation 1
was 1
outspoken 1
dont 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
it 1
madam 1
theres 1
another 1
that 1
youre 1
more 1
beholden 1
to 1
than 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
boys 1
maybe 1
but 1
he 1
dont 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
we 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
been 1
there 1
but 1
for 1
him 1
of 1
course 1
this 1
excited 1
a 1
curiosity 1
so 1
vast 1
that 1
it 1
almost 1
belittled 1
the 1
main 1
matterbut 1
the 1
welshman 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
eat 1
into 1
the 1
vitals 1
of 1
his 1
visitors 1
and 1
through 1
them 1
be 1
transmitted 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
for 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
his 1
secret 1
when 1
all 1
else 1
had 1
been 1
learned 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
reading 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
slept 1
straight 1
through 1
all 1
that 1
noise 1
why 1
didnt 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
wake 1
me 1
we 1
judged 1
it 1
warnt 1
worth 1
while 1
those 1
fellows 1
warnt 1
likely 1
to 1
come 1
againthey 1
hadnt 1
any 1
tools 1
left 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
waking 1
you 1
up 1
and 1
scaring 1
you 1
to 1
death 1
my 1
three 1
negro 1
men 1

at 1
your 1
house 1

the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
theyve 1
just 1
come 1
back 1
more 1
visitors 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
story 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
told 1
and 1
retold 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
more 1
there 1

during 1

but 1
everybody 1
was 1
early 1
at 1
church 1
the 1
stirring 1
event 1
was 1
well 1
canvassed 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
not 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
villains 1
had 1
been 1
yet 1
discovered 1
when 1
the 1
sermon 1
was 1
finished 1
judge 1
thatchers 1
wife 1
dropped 1
alongside 1
of 1
mrs 1
harper 1
as 1
she 1
moved 1
down 1
the 1
aisle 1
with 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
said 1

turned 1
pale 1
and 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
pew 1
just 1
as 1
aunt 1
polly 1
talking 1
briskly 1
with 1
a 1
friend 1
passed 1
by 1

head 1
feebly 1
and 1
turned 1
paler 1
than 1
ever 1
he 1
didnt 1
stay 1
with 1

said 1
mrs 1
harper 1
beginning 1
to 1
look 1
uneasy 1
a 1
marked 1
anxiety 1

into 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
face 1
joe 1

joe 1
tried 1
to 1
remember 1
but 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
he 1
could 1
say 1
the 1
people 1
had 1
stopped 1
moving 1
out 1
of 1
church 1
whispers 1
passed 1
along 1
and 1
a 1
boding 1
uneasiness 1
took 1
possession 1
of 1
every 1
countenance 1
children 1
were 1
anxiously 1
questioned 1
and 1
young 1
teachers 1
they 1
all 1
said 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
noticed 1
whether 1
tom 1
and 1
becky 1
were 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
on 1
the 1
homeward 1
trip 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
no 1
one 1
thought 1
of 1
inquiring 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
was 1
missing 1
one 1
young 1
man 1
finally 1
blurted 1
out 1
his 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
swooned 1
away 1
aunt 1
polly 1
fell 1
to 1
crying 1
and 1
wringing 1
her 1
hands 1
the 1
alarm 1
swept 1
from 1
lip 1
to 1
lip 1
from 1
group 1
to 1
group 1
from 1
street 1
to 1
street 1
and 1
within 1
five 1
minutes 1
the 1
bells 1
were 1
wildly 1
clanging 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
was 1
up 1
the 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
episode 1
sank 1
into 1
instant 1
insignificance 1
the 1
burglars 1
were 1
forgotten 1
horses 1
were 1
saddled 1
skiffs 1
were 1
manned 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
ordered 1
out 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
horror 1
was 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
old 1
two 1
hundred 1
men 1
were 1
pouring 1
down 1
highroad 1
and 1
river 1
toward 1
the 1
cave 1
all 1
the 1
long 1
afternoon 1
the 1
village 1
seemed 1
empty 1
and 1
dead 1
many 1
women 1
visited 1
aunt 1
polly 1
and 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
them 1
they 1
cried 1
with 1
them 1
too 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
still 1
better 1
than 1
words 1
all 1
the 1
tedious 1
night 1
the 1
town 1
waited 1
for 1
news 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
morning 1
dawned 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
the 1
word 1
that 1
came 1
was 1
send 1
more 1
candlesand 1
send 1
food 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
was 1
almost 1
crazed 1
and 1
aunt 1
polly 1
also 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
sent 1
messages 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
encouragement 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
but 1
they 1
conveyed 1
no 1
real 1
cheer 1
the 1
old 1
welshman 1
came 1
home 1
toward 1
daylight 1
spattered 1
with 1
candlegrease 1
smeared 1
with 1
clay 1
and 1
almost 1
worn 1
out 1
he 1
found 1
huck 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
provided 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
delirious 1
with 1
fever 1
the 1
physicians 1
were 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
cave 1
so 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
patient 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
her 1
best 1
by 1
him 1
because 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
good 1
bad 1
or 1
indifferent 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
lords 1
and 1
nothing 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
lords 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
neglected 1
the 1
welshman 1
said 1
huck 1
had 1
good 1
spots 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
you 1
can 1
depend 1
on 1
it 1
thats 1
the 1
lords 1
mark 1
he 1
dont 1
leave 1
it 1
off 1
he 1
never 1
does 1
puts 1
it 1
somewhere 1
on 1
every 1
creature 1
that 1
comes 1
from 1
his 1
hands 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
forenoon 1
parties 1
of 1
jaded 1
men 1
began 1
to 1
straggle 1
into 1
the 1
village 1
but 1
the 1
strongest 1
of 1
the 1
citizens 1
continued 1
searching 1
all 1
the 1
news 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
gained 1
was 1
that 1
remotenesses 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
were 1
being 1
ransacked 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
visited 1
before 1
that 1
every 1
corner 1
and 1
crevice 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
thoroughly 1
searched 1
that 1
wherever 1
one 1
wandered 1
through 1
the 1
maze 1
of 1
passages 1
lights 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
flitting 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
and 1
shoutings 1
and 1
pistolshots 1
sent 1
their 1
hollow 1
reverberations 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
down 1
the 1
sombre 1
aisles 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
section 1
usually 1
traversed 1
by 1
tourists 1
the 1
names 1
becky 1
tom 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
traced 1
upon 1
the 1
rocky 1
wall 1
with 1
candlesmoke 1
and 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
a 1
greasesoiled 1
bit 1
of 1
ribbon 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
recognized 1
the 1
ribbon 1
and 1
cried 1
over 1
it 1
she 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
last 1
relic 1
she 1
should 1
ever 1
have 1
of 1
her 1
child 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
other 1
memorial 1
of 1
her 1
could 1
ever 1
be 1
so 1
precious 1
because 1
this 1
one 1
parted 1
latest 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
body 1
before 1
the 1
awful 1
death 1
came 1
some 1
said 1
that 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
a 1
faraway 1
speck 1
of 1
light 1
would 1
glimmer 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
glorious 1
shout 1
would 1
burst 1
forth 1
and 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
men 1
go 1
trooping 1
down 1
the 1
echoing 1
aisleand 1
then 1
a 1
sickening 1

to 1
tom 1
and 1
beckys 1
share 1
in 1
the 1
picnic 1
they 1
tripped 1
along 1
the 1
murky 1
aisles 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
visiting 1
the 1
familiar 1
wonders 1
of 1

dubbed 1
with 1
rather 1
overdescriptive 1
names 1
such 1
as 1
the 1

palace 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
presently 1
the 1
hideandseek 1
frolicking 1
began 1
and 1
tom 1
and 1
becky 1
engaged 1
in 1
it 1
with 1
zeal 1
until 1
the 1
exertion 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
a 1
trifle 1
wearisome 1
then 1
they 1
wandered 1
down 1
a 1
sinuous 1
avenue 1
holding 1
their 1
candles 1
aloft 1
and 1
reading 1
the 1
tangled 1
webwork 1
of 1
names 1
dates 1
postoffice 1
addresses 1
and 1
mottoes 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
rocky 1
walls 1
had 1
been 1
frescoed 1
in 1
candlesmoke 1
still 1
drifting 1
along 1
and 1
talking 1
they 1
scarcely 1
noticed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
in 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
whose 1
walls 1
were 1
not 1
frescoed 1
they 1
smoked 1
their 1
own 1
names 1
under 1
an 1
overhanging 1
shelf 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
presently 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
little 1
stream 1
of 1
water 1
trickling 1
over 1
a 1
ledge 1
and 1
carrying 1
a 1
limestone 1
sediment 1
with 1
it 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
slowdragging 1
ages 1
formed 1
a 1
laced 1
and 1
ruffled 1
niagara 1
in 1
gleaming 1
and 1
imperishable 1
stone 1
tom 1
squeezed 1
his 1
small 1
body 1
behind 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
illuminate 1
it 1
for 1
beckys 1
gratification 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
curtained 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
steep 1
natural 1
stairway 1
which 1
was 1
enclosed 1
between 1
narrow 1
walls 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
ambition 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
discoverer 1
seized 1
him 1
becky 1
responded 1
to 1
his 1
call 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
smokemark 1
for 1
future 1
guidance 1
and 1
started 1
upon 1
their 1
quest 1
they 1
wound 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
far 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
secret 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
made 1
another 1
mark 1
and 1
branched 1
off 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
novelties 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
upper 1
world 1
about 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
spacious 1
cavern 1
from 1
whose 1
ceiling 1
depended 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
shining 1
stalactites 1
of 1
the 1
length 1
and 1
circumference 1
of 1
a 1
mans 1
leg 1
they 1
walked 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
wondering 1
and 1
admiring 1
and 1
presently 1
left 1
it 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
numerous 1
passages 1
that 1
opened 1
into 1
it 1
this 1
shortly 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
bewitching 1
spring 1
whose 1
basin 1
was 1
incrusted 1
with 1
a 1
frostwork 1
of 1
glittering 1
crystals 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
cavern 1
whose 1
walls 1
were 1
supported 1
by 1
many 1
fantastic 1
pillars 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
formed 1
by 1
the 1
joining 1
of 1
great 1
stalactites 1
and 1
stalagmites 1
together 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
waterdrip 1
of 1
centuries 1
under 1
the 1
roof 1
vast 1
knots 1
of 1
bats 1
had 1
packed 1
themselves 1
together 1
thousands 1
in 1
a 1
bunch 1
the 1
lights 1
disturbed 1
the 1
creatures 1
and 1
they 1
came 1
flocking 1
down 1
by 1
hundreds 1
squeaking 1
and 1
darting 1
furiously 1
at 1
the 1
candles 1
tom 1
knew 1
their 1
ways 1
and 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
conduct 1
he 1
seized 1
beckys 1
hand 1
and 1
hurried 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
first 1
corridor 1
that 1
offered 1
and 1
none 1
too 1
soon 1
for 1
a 1
bat 1
struck 1
beckys 1
light 1
out 1
with 1
its 1
wing 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
passing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
the 1
bats 1
chased 1
the 1
children 1
a 1
good 1
distance 1
but 1
the 1
fugitives 1
plunged 1
into 1
every 1
new 1
passage 1
that 1
offered 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
perilous 1
things 1
tom 1
found 1
a 1
subterranean 1
lake 1
shortly 1
which 1
stretched 1
its 1
dim 1
length 1
away 1
until 1
its 1
shape 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
shadows 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
explore 1
its 1
borders 1
but 1
concluded 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
awhile 1
first 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
deep 1
stillness 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
laid 1
a 1
clammy 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
becky 1
said 1
why 1
i 1
didnt 1
notice 1
but 1
it 1
seems 1
ever 1
so 1
long 1
since 1
i 1
heard 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
come 1
to 1
think 1
becky 1
we 1
are 1
away 1
down 1
below 1
themand 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
far 1
away 1
north 1
or 1
south 1
or 1
east 1
or 1
whichever 1
it 1
is 1
we 1
couldnt 1
hear 1
them 1
here 1
becky 1
grew 1
apprehensive 1
i 1
wonder 1
how 1
long 1
weve 1
been 1
down 1
here 1
tom 1
we 1
better 1
start 1
back 1
yes 1
i 1
reckon 1
we 1
better 1
praps 1
we 1
better 1
can 1
you 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
tom 1
its 1
all 1
a 1
mixedup 1
crookedness 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
could 1
find 1
itbut 1
then 1
the 1
bats 1
if 1
they 1
put 1
our 1
candles 1
out 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
awful 1
fix 1
lets 1
try 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
so 1
as 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
there 1
well 1
but 1
i 1
hope 1
we 1
wont 1
get 1
lost 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
awful 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
shuddered 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
possibilities 1
they 1
started 1
through 1
a 1
corridor 1
and 1
traversed 1
it 1
in 1
silence 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
glancing 1
at 1
each 1
new 1
opening 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
familiar 1
about 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
strange 1
every 1
time 1
tom 1
made 1
an 1
examination 1
becky 1
would 1
watch 1
his 1
face 1
for 1
an 1
encouraging 1
sign 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
cheerily 1
oh 1
its 1
all 1
right 1
this 1
aint 1
the 1
one 1
but 1
well 1
come 1
to 1
it 1
right 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
less 1
and 1
less 1
hopeful 1
with 1
each 1
failure 1
and 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
off 1
into 1
diverging 1
avenues 1
at 1
sheer 1
random 1
in 1
desperate 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
wanted 1
he 1
still 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
leaden 1
dread 1
at 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
had 1
lost 1
their 1
ring 1
and 1
sounded 1
just 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
all 1
is 1
lost 1
becky 1
clung 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
in 1
an 1
anguish 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
tried 1
hard 1
to 1
keep 1
back 1
the 1
tears 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
come 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
said 1
oh 1
tom 1
never 1
mind 1
the 1
bats 1
lets 1
go 1
back 1
that 1
way 1
we 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
worse 1
and 1
worse 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
listen 1
said 1
he 1
profound 1
silence 1
silence 1
so 1
deep 1
that 1
even 1
their 1
breathings 1
were 1
conspicuous 1
in 1
the 1
hush 1
tom 1
shouted 1
the 1
call 1
went 1
echoing 1
down 1
the 1
empty 1
aisles 1
and 1
died 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
in 1
a 1
faint 1
sound 1
that 1
resembled 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
mocking 1
laughter 1
oh 1
dont 1
do 1
it 1
again 1
tom 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
horrid 1
said 1
becky 1
it 1
is 1
horrid 1
but 1
i 1
better 1
becky 1
they 1
might 1
hear 1
us 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
he 1
shouted 1
again 1
the 1
might 1
was 1
even 1
a 1
chillier 1
horror 1
than 1
the 1
ghostly 1
laughter 1
it 1
so 1
confessed 1
a 1
perishing 1
hope 1
the 1
children 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
result 1
tom 1
turned 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
track 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
hurried 1
his 1
steps 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
before 1
a 1
certain 1
indecision 1
in 1
his 1
manner 1
revealed 1
another 1
fearful 1
fact 1
to 1
beckyhe 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
oh 1
tom 1
you 1
didnt 1
make 1
any 1
marks 1
becky 1
i 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
i 1
never 1
thought 1
we 1
might 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
noi 1
cant 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
its 1
all 1
mixed 1
up 1
tom 1
tom 1
were 1
lost 1
were 1
lost 1
we 1
never 1
can 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
awful 1
place 1
oh 1
why 1
_did_ 1
we 1
ever 1
leave 1
the 1
others 1
she 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
frenzy 1
of 1
crying 1
that 1
tom 1
was 1
appalled 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
die 1
or 1
lose 1
her 1
reason 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
arms 1
around 1
her 1
she 1
buried 1
her 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
bosom 1
she 1
clung 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
poured 1
out 1
her 1
terrors 1
her 1
unavailing 1
regrets 1
and 1
the 1
far 1
echoes 1
turned 1
them 1
all 1
to 1
jeering 1
laughter 1
tom 1
begged 1
her 1
to 1
pluck 1
up 1
hope 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
he 1
fell 1
to 1
blaming 1
and 1
abusing 1
himself 1
for 1
getting 1
her 1
into 1
this 1
miserable 1
situation 1
this 1
had 1
a 1
better 1
effect 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
hope 1
again 1
she 1
would 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
follow 1
wherever 1
he 1
might 1
lead 1
if 1
only 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
any 1
more 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
blame 1
than 1
she 1
she 1
said 1
so 1
they 1
moved 1
on 1
againaimlesslysimply 1
at 1
randomall 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
move 1
keep 1
moving 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
hope 1
made 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
revivingnot 1
with 1
any 1
reason 1
to 1
back 1
it 1
but 1
only 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
its 1
nature 1
to 1
revive 1
when 1
the 1
spring 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
taken 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
by 1
age 1
and 1
familiarity 1
with 1
failure 1
byandby 1
tom 1
took 1
beckys 1
candle 1
and 1
blew 1
it 1
out 1
this 1
economy 1
meant 1
so 1
much 1
words 1
were 1
not 1
needed 1
becky 1
understood 1
and 1
her 1
hope 1
died 1
again 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
tom 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
candle 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
pieces 1
in 1
his 1
pocketsyet 1
he 1
must 1
economize 1
byandby 1
fatigue 1
began 1
to 1
assert 1
its 1
claims 1
the 1
children 1
tried 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
sitting 1
down 1
when 1
time 1
was 1
grown 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
precious 1
moving 1
in 1
some 1
direction 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
progress 1
and 1
might 1
bear 1
fruit 1
but 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
was 1
to 1
invite 1
death 1
and 1
shorten 1
its 1
pursuit 1
at 1
last 1
beckys 1
frail 1
limbs 1
refused 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
farther 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
tom 1
rested 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
talked 1
of 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
friends 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
comfortable 1
beds 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
light 1
becky 1
cried 1
and 1
tom 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
some 1
way 1
of 1
comforting 1
her 1
but 1
all 1
his 1
encouragements 1
were 1
grown 1
threadbare 1
with 1
use 1
and 1
sounded 1
like 1
sarcasms 1
fatigue 1
bore 1
so 1
heavily 1
upon 1
becky 1
that 1
she 1
drowsed 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
tom 1
was 1
grateful 1
he 1
sat 1
looking 1
into 1
her 1
drawn 1
face 1
and 1
saw 1
it 1
grow 1
smooth 1
and 1
natural 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
pleasant 1
dreams 1
and 1
byandby 1
a 1
smile 1
dawned 1
and 1
rested 1
there 1
the 1
peaceful 1
face 1
reflected 1
somewhat 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
healing 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
spirit 1
and 1
his 1
thoughts 1
wandered 1
away 1
to 1
bygone 1
times 1
and 1
dreamy 1
memories 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
deep 1
in 1
his 1
musings 1
becky 1
woke 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
breezy 1
little 1
laughbut 1
it 1
was 1
stricken 1
dead 1
upon 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
a 1
groan 1
followed 1
it 1
oh 1
how 1
_could_ 1
i 1
sleep 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
never 1
never 1
had 1
waked 1

tom 1

look 1
so 1
i 1
wont 1
say 1

and 1

the 1
way 1

tom 1
but 1
ive 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
country 1
in 1
my 1
dream 1
i 1
reckon 1

going 1
there 1
maybe 1
not 1
maybe 1
not 1
cheer 1
up 1
becky 1
and 1
lets 1
go 1
on 1
trying 1
they 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
wandered 1
along 1
hand 1
in 1
hand 1
and 1
hopeless 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
estimate 1
how 1
long 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
but 1
all 1
they 1
knew 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
days 1
and 1
weeks 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
that 1
this 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
for 1
their 1
candles 1
were 1
not 1
gone 1
yet 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
thisthey 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
how 1
longtom 1
said 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
softly 1
and 1
listen 1
for 1
dripping 1
waterthey 1
must 1
find 1
a 1
spring 1
they 1
found 1
one 1
presently 1
and 1
tom 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
rest 1
again 1
both 1
were 1
cruelly 1
tired 1
yet 1
becky 1
said 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
go 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
she 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
hear 1
tom 1
dissent 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
it 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
tom 1
fastened 1
his 1
candle 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
some 1
clay 1
thought 1
was 1
soon 1
busy 1
nothing 1
was 1
said 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
then 1
becky 1
broke 1
the 1
silence 1
tom 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
tom 1
took 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
do 1
you 1
remember 1
this 1
said 1
he 1
becky 1
almost 1
smiled 1
its 1
our 1
weddingcake 1
tom 1
yesi 1
wish 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
barrel 1
for 1
its 1
all 1
weve 1
got 1
i 1
saved 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
picnic 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
dream 1
on 1
tom 1
the 1
way 1
grownup 1
people 1
do 1
with 1
weddingcakebut 1
itll 1
be 1
our 1
she 1
dropped 1
the 1
sentence 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
tom 1
divided 1
the 1
cake 1
and 1
becky 1
ate 1
with 1
good 1
appetite 1
while 1
tom 1
nibbled 1
at 1
his 1
moiety 1
there 1
was 1
abundance 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
to 1
finish 1
the 1
feast 1
with 1
byandby 1
becky 1
suggested 1
that 1
they 1
move 1
on 1
again 1
tom 1
was 1
silent 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
becky 1
can 1
you 1
bear 1
it 1
if 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
beckys 1
face 1
paled 1
but 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
well 1
then 1
becky 1
we 1
must 1
stay 1
here 1
where 1
theres 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
that 1
little 1
piece 1
is 1
our 1
last 1
candle 1
becky 1
gave 1
loose 1
to 1
tears 1
and 1
wailings 1
tom 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
but 1
with 1
little 1
effect 1
at 1
length 1
becky 1
said 1
tom 1
well 1
becky 1
theyll 1
miss 1
us 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
us 1
yes 1
they 1
will 1
certainly 1
they 1
will 1
maybe 1
theyre 1
hunting 1
for 1
us 1
now 1
tom 1
why 1
i 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
they 1
are 1
i 1
hope 1
they 1
are 1
when 1
would 1
they 1
miss 1
us 1
tom 1
when 1
they 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
boat 1
i 1
reckon 1
tom 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
dark 1
thenwould 1
they 1
notice 1
we 1
hadnt 1
come 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
but 1
anyway 1
your 1
mother 1
would 1
miss 1
you 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
got 1
home 1
a 1
frightened 1
look 1
in 1
beckys 1
face 1
brought 1
tom 1
to 1
his 1
senses 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
blunder 1
becky 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
home 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
children 1
became 1
silent 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
a 1
new 1
burst 1
of 1
grief 1
from 1
becky 1
showed 1
tom 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
had 1
struck 1
hers 1
alsothat 1
the 1
sabbath 1
morning 1
might 1
be 1
half 1
spent 1
before 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
discovered 1
that 1
becky 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
mrs 1
harpers 1
the 1
children 1
fastened 1
their 1
eyes 1
upon 1
their 1
bit 1
of 1
candle 1
and 1
watched 1
it 1
melt 1
slowly 1
and 1
pitilessly 1
away 1
saw 1
the 1
half 1
inch 1
of 1
wick 1
stand 1
alone 1
at 1
last 1
saw 1
the 1
feeble 1
flame 1
rise 1
and 1
fall 1
climb 1
the 1
thin 1
column 1
of 1
smoke 1
linger 1
at 1
its 1
top 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
thenthe 1
horror 1
of 1
utter 1
darkness 1
reigned 1
how 1
long 1
afterward 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
becky 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
consciousness 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
crying 1
in 1
toms 1
arms 1
neither 1
could 1
tell 1
all 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
was 1
that 1
after 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
mighty 1
stretch 1
of 1
time 1
both 1
awoke 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
dead 1
stupor 1
of 1
sleep 1
and 1
resumed 1
their 1
miseries 1
once 1
more 1
tom 1
said 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
sunday 1
nowmaybe 1
monday 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
becky 1
to 1
talk 1
but 1
her 1
sorrows 1
were 1
too 1
oppressive 1
all 1
her 1
hopes 1
were 1
gone 1
tom 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
missed 1
long 1
ago 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
the 1
search 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
he 1
would 1
shout 1
and 1
maybe 1
some 1
one 1
would 1
come 1
he 1
tried 1
it 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
the 1
distant 1
echoes 1
sounded 1
so 1
hideously 1
that 1
he 1
tried 1
it 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
hours 1
wasted 1
away 1
and 1
hunger 1
came 1
to 1
torment 1
the 1
captives 1
again 1
a 1
portion 1
of 1
toms 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
cake 1
was 1
left 1
they 1
divided 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
but 1
they 1
seemed 1
hungrier 1
than 1
before 1
the 1
poor 1
morsel 1
of 1
food 1
only 1
whetted 1
desire 1
byandby 1
tom 1
said 1
sh 1
did 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
both 1
held 1
their 1
breath 1
and 1
listened 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sound 1
like 1
the 1
faintest 1
faroff 1
shout 1
instantly 1
tom 1
answered 1
it 1
and 1
leading 1
becky 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
started 1
groping 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
in 1
its 1
direction 1
presently 1
he 1
listened 1
again 1
again 1
the 1
sound 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
apparently 1
a 1
little 1
nearer 1
its 1
them 1
said 1
tom 1
theyre 1
coming 1
come 1
along 1
beckywere 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
the 1
prisoners 1
was 1
almost 1
overwhelming 1
their 1
speed 1
was 1
slow 1
however 1
because 1
pitfalls 1
were 1
somewhat 1
common 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
guarded 1
against 1
they 1
shortly 1
came 1
to 1
one 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
stop 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
three 1
feet 1
deep 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
hundredthere 1
was 1
no 1
passing 1
it 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
tom 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
reached 1
as 1
far 1
down 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
bottom 1
they 1
must 1
stay 1
there 1
and 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
searchers 1
came 1
they 1
listened 1
evidently 1
the 1
distant 1
shoutings 1
were 1
growing 1
more 1
distant 1
a 1
moment 1
or 1
two 1
more 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
altogether 1
the 1
heartsinking 1
misery 1
of 1
it 1
tom 1
whooped 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
hoarse 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
he 1
talked 1
hopefully 1
to 1
becky 1
but 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
anxious 1
waiting 1
passed 1
and 1
no 1
sounds 1
came 1
again 1
the 1
children 1
groped 1
their 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
the 1
weary 1
time 1
dragged 1
on 1
they 1
slept 1
again 1
and 1
awoke 1
famished 1
and 1
woestricken 1
tom 1
believed 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
tuesday 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
now 1
an 1
idea 1
struck 1
him 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
side 1
passages 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
explore 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
than 1
bear 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
time 1
in 1
idleness 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
kiteline 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
tied 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
projection 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
becky 1
started 1
tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
unwinding 1
the 1
line 1
as 1
he 1
groped 1
along 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
twenty 1
steps 1
the 1
corridor 1
ended 1
in 1
a 1
jumpingoff 1
place 1
tom 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
felt 1
below 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
far 1
around 1
the 1
corner 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
conveniently 1
he 1
made 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
stretch 1
yet 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
not 1
twenty 1
yards 1
away 1
a 1
human 1
hand 1
holding 1
a 1
candle 1
appeared 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
rock 1
tom 1
lifted 1
up 1
a 1
glorious 1
shout 1
and 1
instantly 1
that 1
hand 1
was 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
body 1
it 1
belonged 1
toinjun 1
joes 1
tom 1
was 1
paralyzed 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
he 1
was 1
vastly 1
gratified 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
spaniard 1
take 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
get 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
tom 1
wondered 1
that 1
joe 1
had 1
not 1
recognized 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
come 1
over 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
for 1
testifying 1
in 1
court 1
but 1
the 1
echoes 1
must 1
have 1
disguised 1
the 1
voice 1
without 1
doubt 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
he 1
reasoned 1
toms 1
fright 1
weakened 1
every 1
muscle 1
in 1
his 1
body 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
there 1
and 1
nothing 1
should 1
tempt 1
him 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
risk 1
of 1
meeting 1
injun 1
joe 1
again 1
he 1
was 1
careful 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
becky 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
shouted 1
for 1
luck 1
but 1
hunger 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
rise 1
superior 1
to 1
fears 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
another 1
tedious 1
wait 1
at 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
another 1
long 1
sleep 1
brought 1
changes 1
the 1
children 1
awoke 1
tortured 1
with 1
a 1
raging 1
hunger 1
tom 1
believed 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
wednesday 1
or 1
thursday 1
or 1
even 1
friday 1
or 1
saturday 1
now 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
search 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
over 1
he 1
proposed 1
to 1
explore 1
another 1
passage 1
he 1
felt 1
willing 1
to 1
risk 1
injun 1
joe 1
and 1
all 1
other 1
terrors 1
but 1
becky 1
was 1
very 1
weak 1
she 1
had 1
sunk 1
into 1
a 1
dreary 1
apathy 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
roused 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
wait 1
now 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
dieit 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
she 1
told 1
tom 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
the 1
kiteline 1
and 1
explore 1
if 1
he 1
chose 1
but 1
she 1
implored 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
made 1
him 1
promise 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
awful 1
time 1
came 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
hold 1
her 1
hand 1
until 1
all 1
was 1
over 1
tom 1
kissed 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
choking 1
sensation 1
in 1
his 1
throat 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
being 1
confident 1
of 1
finding 1
the 1
searchers 1
or 1
an 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
kiteline 1

went 1
groping 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
passages 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
distressed 1
with 1
hunger 1
and 1
sick 1
with 1
bodings 1
of 1
coming 1

tuesday 1
afternoon 1
came 1
and 1
waned 1
to 1
the 1
twilight 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
st 1
petersburg 1
still 1
mourned 1
the 1
lost 1
children 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
found 1
public 1
prayers 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
up 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
many 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
private 1
prayer 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
petitioners 1
whole 1
heart 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
still 1
no 1
good 1
news 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
majority 1
of 1
the 1
searchers 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
the 1
quest 1
and 1
gone 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
daily 1
avocations 1
saying 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
the 1
children 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
found 1
mrs 1
thatcher 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
delirious 1
people 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
heartbreaking 1
to 1
hear 1
her 1
call 1
her 1
child 1
and 1
raise 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
listen 1
a 1
whole 1
minute 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
then 1
lay 1
it 1
wearily 1
down 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
moan 1
aunt 1
polly 1
had 1
drooped 1
into 1
a 1
settled 1
melancholy 1
and 1
her 1
gray 1
hair 1
had 1
grown 1
almost 1
white 1
the 1
village 1
went 1
to 1
its 1
rest 1
on 1
tuesday 1
night 1
sad 1
and 1
forlorn 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
a 1
wild 1
peal 1
burst 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
bells 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
streets 1
were 1
swarming 1
with 1
frantic 1
halfclad 1
people 1
who 1
shouted 1
turn 1
out 1
turn 1
out 1
theyre 1
found 1
theyre 1
found 1
tin 1
pans 1
and 1
horns 1
were 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
din 1
the 1
population 1
massed 1
itself 1
and 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
river 1
met 1
the 1
children 1
coming 1
in 1
an 1
open 1
carriage 1
drawn 1
by 1
shouting 1
citizens 1
thronged 1
around 1
it 1
joined 1
its 1
homeward 1
march 1
and 1
swept 1
magnificently 1
up 1
the 1
main 1
street 1
roaring 1
huzzah 1
after 1
huzzah 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
illuminated 1
nobody 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
greatest 1
night 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
halfhour 1
a 1
procession 1
of 1
villagers 1
filed 1
through 1
judge 1
thatchers 1
house 1
seized 1
the 1
saved 1
ones 1
and 1
kissed 1
them 1
squeezed 1
mrs 1
thatchers 1
hand 1
tried 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
couldntand 1
drifted 1
out 1
raining 1
tears 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
happiness 1
was 1
complete 1
and 1
mrs 1
thatchers 1
nearly 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
complete 1
however 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
messenger 1
dispatched 1
with 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
should 1
get 1
the 1
word 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
tom 1
lay 1
upon 1
a 1
sofa 1
with 1
an 1
eager 1
auditory 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
adventure 1
putting 1
in 1
many 1
striking 1
additions 1
to 1
adorn 1
it 1
withal 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
description 1
of 1
how 1
he 1
left 1
becky 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
an 1
exploring 1
expedition 1
how 1
he 1
followed 1
two 1
avenues 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
his 1
kiteline 1
would 1
reach 1
how 1
he 1
followed 1
a 1
third 1
to 1
the 1
fullest 1
stretch 1
of 1
the 1
kiteline 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
turn 1
back 1
when 1
he 1
glimpsed 1
a 1
faroff 1
speck 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
daylight 1
dropped 1
the 1
line 1
and 1
groped 1
toward 1
it 1
pushed 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
shoulders 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
hole 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
broad 1
mississippi 1
rolling 1
by 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
only 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
night 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
seen 1
that 1
speck 1
of 1
daylight 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
explored 1
that 1
passage 1
any 1
more 1
he 1
told 1
how 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
for 1
becky 1
and 1
broke 1
the 1
good 1
news 1
and 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
not 1
to 1
fret 1
her 1
with 1
such 1
stuff 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
he 1
described 1
how 1
he 1
labored 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
convinced 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
almost 1
died 1
for 1
joy 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
groped 1
to 1
where 1
she 1
actually 1
saw 1
the 1
blue 1
speck 1
of 1
daylight 1
how 1
he 1
pushed 1
his 1
way 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
then 1
helped 1
her 1
out 1
how 1
they 1
sat 1
there 1
and 1
cried 1
for 1
gladness 1
how 1
some 1
men 1
came 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
and 1
tom 1
hailed 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
their 1
situation 1
and 1
their 1
famished 1
condition 1
how 1
the 1
men 1
didnt 1
believe 1
the 1
wild 1
tale 1
at 1
first 1
because 1
said 1
they 1
you 1
are 1
five 1
miles 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
below 1
the 1
valley 1
the 1
cave 1
is 1
inthen 1
took 1
them 1
aboard 1
rowed 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
gave 1
them 1
supper 1
made 1
them 1
rest 1
till 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
after 1
dark 1
and 1
then 1
brought 1
them 1
home 1
before 1
daydawn 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
and 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
searchers 1
with 1
him 1
were 1
tracked 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
by 1
the 1
twine 1
clews 1
they 1
had 1
strung 1
behind 1
them 1
and 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
toil 1
and 1
hunger 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
shaken 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
as 1
tom 1
and 1
becky 1
soon 1
discovered 1
they 1
were 1
bedridden 1
all 1
of 1
wednesday 1
and 1
thursday 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
grow 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
tired 1
and 1
worn 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
tom 1
got 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
on 1
thursday 1
was 1
downtown 1
friday 1
and 1
nearly 1
as 1
whole 1
as 1
ever 1
saturday 1
but 1
becky 1
did 1
not 1
leave 1
her 1
room 1
until 1
sunday 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
wasting 1
illness 1
tom 1
learned 1
of 1
hucks 1
sickness 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
on 1
friday 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
bedroom 1
neither 1
could 1
he 1
on 1
saturday 1
or 1
sunday 1
he 1
was 1
admitted 1
daily 1
after 1
that 1
but 1
was 1
warned 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
about 1
his 1
adventure 1
and 1
introduce 1
no 1
exciting 1
topic 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
stayed 1
by 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
obeyed 1
at 1
home 1
tom 1
learned 1
of 1
the 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
event 1
also 1
that 1
the 1
ragged 1
mans 1
body 1
had 1
eventually 1
been 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
near 1
the 1
ferrylanding 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
drowned 1
while 1
trying 1
to 1
escape 1
perhaps 1
about 1
a 1
fortnight 1
after 1
toms 1
rescue 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
he 1
started 1
off 1
to 1
visit 1
huck 1
who 1
had 1
grown 1
plenty 1
strong 1
enough 1
now 1
to 1
hear 1
exciting 1
talk 1
and 1
tom 1
had 1
some 1
that 1
would 1
interest 1
him 1
he 1
thought 1
judge 1
thatchers 1
house 1
was 1
on 1
toms 1
way 1
and 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
see 1
becky 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
some 1
friends 1
set 1
tom 1
to 1
talking 1
and 1
some 1
one 1
asked 1
him 1
ironically 1
if 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
again 1
tom 1
said 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
mind 1
it 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
well 1
there 1
are 1
others 1

like 1

tom 1
ive 1
not 1
the 1
least 1
doubt 1
but 1

taken 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
nobody 1
will 1
get 1
lost 1
in 1
that 1
cave 1
any 1
more 1
why 1
because 1
i 1

its 1
big 1
door 1

with 1
boiler 1
iron 1
two 1
weeks 1
ago 1

joes 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
chapter 1
xxxiii 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
the 1
news 1
had 1
spread 1
and 1
a 1
dozen 1
skiffloads 1
of 1
men 1
were 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
mcdougals 1
cave 1
and 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
well 1
filled 1
with 1
passengers 1
soon 1
followed 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
skiff 1
that 1
bore 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
when 1
the 1
cave 1
door 1
was 1
unlocked 1
a 1
sorrowful 1
sight 1
presented 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
twilight 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
injun 1
joe 1
lay 1
stretched 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
dead 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
longing 1
eyes 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
to 1
the 1
latest 1
moment 1
upon 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
cheer 1
of 1
the 1
free 1
world 1
outside 1
tom 1
was 1
touched 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
experience 1
how 1
this 1
wretch 1
had 1
suffered 1
his 1
pity 1
was 1
moved 1
but 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
felt 1
an 1
abounding 1
sense 1
of 1
relief 1
and 1
security 1
now 1
which 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
fully 1
appreciated 1
before 1
how 1
vast 1
a 1
weight 1
of 1
dread 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
upon 1
him 1
since 1
the 1
day 1
he 1
lifted 1
his 1
voice 1
against 1
this 1
bloodyminded 1
outcast 1
injun 1
joes 1
bowieknife 1
lay 1
close 1
by 1
its 1
blade 1
broken 1
in 1
two 1
the 1
great 1
foundationbeam 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
chipped 1
and 1
hacked 1
through 1
with 1
tedious 1
labor 1
useless 1
labor 1
too 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
native 1
rock 1
formed 1
a 1
sill 1
outside 1
it 1
and 1
upon 1
that 1
stubborn 1
material 1
the 1
knife 1
had 1
wrought 1
no 1
effect 1
the 1
only 1
damage 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
knife 1
itself 1
but 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
stony 1
obstruction 1
there 1
the 1
labor 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
useless 1
still 1
for 1
if 1
the 1
beam 1
had 1
been 1
wholly 1
cut 1
away 1
injun 1
joe 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
squeezed 1
his 1
body 1
under 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
hacked 1
that 1
place 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
doing 1
somethingin 1
order 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
weary 1
timein 1
order 1
to 1
employ 1
his 1
tortured 1
faculties 1
ordinarily 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
bits 1
of 1
candle 1
stuck 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
crevices 1
of 1
this 1
vestibule 1
left 1
there 1
by 1
tourists 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
none 1
now 1
the 1
prisoner 1
had 1
searched 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
eaten 1
them 1
he 1
had 1
also 1
contrived 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
few 1
bats 1
and 1
these 1
also 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
leaving 1
only 1
their 1
claws 1
the 1
poor 1
unfortunate 1
had 1
starved 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
a 1
stalagmite 1
had 1
been 1
slowly 1
growing 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
for 1
ages 1
builded 1
by 1
the 1
waterdrip 1
from 1
a 1
stalactite 1
overhead 1
the 1
captive 1
had 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
stalagmite 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
stump 1
had 1
placed 1
a 1
stone 1
wherein 1
he 1
had 1
scooped 1
a 1
shallow 1
hollow 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
precious 1
drop 1
that 1
fell 1
once 1
in 1
every 1
three 1
minutes 1
with 1
the 1
dreary 1
regularity 1
of 1
a 1
clockticka 1
dessertspoonful 1
once 1
in 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
hours 1
that 1
drop 1
was 1
falling 1
when 1
the 1
pyramids 1
were 1
new 1
when 1
troy 1
fell 1
when 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1

were 1
laid 1

falling 1
now 1
it 1
will 1
still 1
be 1
falling 1
when 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
shall 1
have 1
sunk 1
down 1
the 1
afternoon 1
of 1
history 1

the 1
twilight 1
of 1
tradition 1

up 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
night 1
of 1
oblivion 1
has 1
everything 1
a 1
purpose 1
and 1
a 1
mission 1
did 1
this 1
drop 1
fall 1
patiently 1
during 1
five 1
thousand 1
years 1
to 1
be 1
ready 1
for 1
this 1
flitting 1
human 1
insects 1

it 1
another 1
important 1
object 1

accomplish 1
ten 1

many 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
year 1
since 1
the 1
hapless 1
halfbreed 1
scooped 1
out 1
the 1
stone 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
priceless 1
drops 1

flocked 1
there 1
in 1
boats 1
and 1
wagons 1
from 1
the 1
towns 1
and 1
from 1
all 1
the 1

seven 1
miles 1
around 1
they 1
brought 1
their 1
children 1

all 1
sorts 1
of 1

around 1

and 1
all 1
that 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
entered 1
the 1
hole 1
tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
they 1
toiled 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
tunnel 1
then 1
made 1
their 1
spliced 1
kitestrings 1
fast 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
a 1
few 1
steps 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
tom 1
felt 1
a 1
shudder 1
quiver 1
all 1
through 1
him 1
he 1
showed 1
huck 1
the 1
fragment 1
of 1
candlewick 1
perched 1
on 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
clay 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
described 1
how 1
he 1
and 1
becky 1
had 1
watched 1
the 1
flame 1
struggle 1
and 1
expire 1
the 1
boys 1
began 1
to 1
quiet 1
down 1
to 1
whispers 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
stillness 1
and 1
gloom 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
oppressed 1
their 1
spirits 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
presently 1
entered 1
and 1
followed 1
toms 1
other 1
corridor 1
until 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
jumpingoff 1
place 1
the 1
candles 1
revealed 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
really 1
a 1
precipice 1
but 1
only 1
a 1
steep 1
clay 1
hill 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
feet 1
high 1
tom 1
whispered 1
now 1
ill 1
show 1
you 1
something 1
huck 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
candle 1
aloft 1
and 1
said 1

far 1
around 1
the 1
corner 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
do 1

see 1
that 1

huck 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
mystic 1
sign 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
shaky 1
voice 1
tom 1

the 1
ways 1
of 1
ghosts 1
and 1
so 1
do 1
you 1
tom 1
began 1
to 1
fear 1
that 1
huck 1
was 1
right 1
misgivings 1
gathered 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
but 1
presently 1
an 1
idea 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
lookyhere 1
huck 1

making 1
of 1
ourselves 1
injun 1

its 1
effect 1

went 1
first 1
cutting 1
rude 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
clay 1
hill 1
as 1
he 1
descended 1
huck 1
followed 1
four 1
avenues 1
opened 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
cavern 1
which 1
the 1
great 1
rock 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
boys 1
examined 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
no 1
result 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
small 1
recess 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
nearest 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
with 1
a 1
pallet 1
of 1
blankets 1
spread 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
also 1
an 1
old 1
suspender 1
some 1
bacon 1
rind 1
and 1
the 1
wellgnawed 1
bones 1
of 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
fowls 1
but 1
there 1

tom 1

said 1
_under_ 1
the 1
cross 1

comes 1
nearest 1
to 1
being 1
under 1
the 1
cross 1
it 1
cant 1
be 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
itself 1
because 1
that 1
sets 1
solid 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
they 1
searched 1
everywhere 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
sat 1
down 1
discouraged 1
huck 1
could 1
suggest 1
nothing 1
byandby 1
tom 1
said 1

and 1
some 1
candlegrease 1
on 1
the 1
clay 1
about 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
rock 1
but 1
not 1
on 1

other 1
sides 1

going 1
to 1
dig 1
in 1
the 1
clay 1
that 1
aint 1
no 1
bad 1
notion 1
tom 1
said 1
huck 1
with 1
animation 1
toms 1
real 1
barlow 1
was 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
dug 1
four 1
inches 1
before 1
he 1
struck 1
wood 1
hey 1
huckyou 1
hear 1
that 1
huck 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
and 1
scratch 1
now 1
some 1
boards 1
were 1
soon 1
uncovered 1
and 1
removed 1
they 1
had 1
concealed 1
a 1
natural 1
chasm 1
which 1
led 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
tom 1
got 1
into 1
this 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
candle 1
as 1
far 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
rift 1
he 1
proposed 1
to 1
explore 1
he 1
stooped 1
and 1
passed 1
under 1
the 1
narrow 1
way 1
descended 1
gradually 1
he 1
followed 1
its 1
winding 1
course 1
first 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
huck 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
tom 1
turned 1
a 1
short 1
curve 1
byandby 1
and 1
exclaimed 1

but 1
the 1
surprise 1
it 1
occasioned 1
was 1
largely 1
counterfeit 1
and 1
not 1
as 1
clamorous 1
and 1
effusive 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
under 1
happier 1
circumstances 1
however 1
the 1
widow 1
made 1
a 1
pretty 1
fair 1
show 1
of 1
astonishment 1
and 1
heaped 1
so 1
many 1
compliments 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
gratitude 1
upon 1
huck 1
that 1
he 1
almost 1
forgot 1
the 1
nearly 1
intolerable 1
discomfort 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
clothes 1
in 1
the 1
entirely 1
intolerable 1
discomfort 1
of 1
being 1
set 1
up 1
as 1
a 1
target 1
for 1
everybodys 1
gaze 1
and 1
everybodys 1
laudations 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
she 1
meant 1
to 1
give 1
huck 1
a 1
home 1
under 1
her 1
roof 1
and 1
have 1
him 1
educated 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
could 1
spare 1
the 1
money 1
she 1
would 1
start 1
him 1
in 1
business 1
in 1
a 1
modest 1
way 1

chance 1

come 1
he 1
said 1
huck 1

heavy 1
strain 1
upon 1
the 1
good 1
manners 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
kept 1
back 1
the 1
due 1
and 1
proper 1
complimentary 1
laugh 1
at 1
this 1
pleasant 1
joke 1
but 1
the 1
silence 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
awkward 1
tom 1
broke 1

call 1
for 1
an 1
explanation 1
tom 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
furnish 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
tale 1
was 1
long 1
but 1
brimful 1
of 1
interest 1
there 1
was 1
scarcely 1
an 1
interruption 1
from 1
any 1

little 1
over 1
twelve 1

the 1
reader 1
may 1
rest 1
satisfied 1
that 1
toms 1
and 1
hucks 1
windfall 1
made 1
a 1
mighty 1
stir 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
village 1
of 1
st 1
petersburg 1
so 1
vast 1
a 1
sum 1
all 1
in 1
actual 1
cash 1
seemed 1
next 1
to 1
incredible 1
it 1
was 1
talked 1
about 1
gloated 1
over 1
glorified 1
until 1
the 1
reason 1
of 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
citizens 1
tottered 1
under 1
the 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
unhealthy 1
excitement 1
every 1
haunted 1
house 1
in 1

the 1
neighboring 1

not 1
able 1

remember 1
that 1
their 1

possessed 1
weight 1
before 1
but 1
now 1
their 1

were 1
treasured 1
and 1
repeated 1
everything 1
they 1
did 1
seemed 1
somehow 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
remarkable 1
they 1
had 1
evidently 1
lost 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
doing 1
and 1
saying 1
commonplace 1
things 1
moreover 1
their 1
past 1
history 1
was 1
raked 1
up 1
and 1

bear 1

that 1

for 1
every 1
weekday 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
and 1
half 1
of 1

it 1
was 1

what 1

gotno 1
it 1

boy 1
in 1
those 1
old 1
simple 1
daysand 1
clothe 1
him 1
and 1
wash 1
him 1
too 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
great 1
opinion 1
of 1
tom 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
no 1
commonplace 1
boy 1
would 1
ever 1
have 1
got 1
his 1
daughter 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
when 1
becky 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
in 1
strict 1
confidence 1
how 1
tom 1
had 1
taken 1
her 1
whipping 1
at 1
school 1
the 1
judge 1
was 1
visibly 1
moved 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
pleaded 1
grace 1
for 1
the 1
mighty 1
lie 1
which 1
tom 1
had 1
told 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
shift 1
that 1
whipping 1
from 1
her 1
shoulders 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
fine 1
outburst 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
noble 1
a 1
generous 1
a 1
magnanimous 1
liea 1
lie 1
that 1
was 1
worthy 1
to 1
hold 1
up 1
its 1
head 1
and 1
march 1
down 1
through 1
history 1
breast 1
to 1
breast 1
with 1
george 1
washingtons 1
lauded 1
truth 1
about 1
the 1
hatchet 1
becky 1
thought 1
her 1
father 1
had 1
never 1
looked 1
so 1
tall 1
and 1
so 1
superb 1
as 1
when 1
he 1
walked 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
told 1
tom 1
about 1
it 1
judge 1
thatcher 1
hoped 1
to 1
see 1
tom 1
a 1
great 1
lawyer 1
or 1
a 1
great 1
soldier 1
some 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
look 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
tom 1
should 1
be 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
national 1
military 1
academy 1
and 1
afterward 1
trained 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
law 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
ready 1
for 1
either 1
career 1
or 1
both 1
huck 1
finns 1
wealth 1
and 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
widow 1
douglas 1
protection 1
introduced 1
him 1
into 1
societyno 1
dragged 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
hurled 1
him 1
into 1
itand 1
his 1
sufferings 1
were 1
almost 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
bear 1
the 1
widows 1
servants 1
kept 1
him 1
clean 1
and 1
neat 1
combed 1
and 1
brushed 1
and 1
they 1
bedded 1
him 1
nightly 1
in 1
unsympathetic 1
sheets 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
one 1
little 1
spot 1
or 1
stain 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
press 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
know 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
eat 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
fork 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
napkin 1

and 1

he 1
had 1
to 1
learn 1
his 1
book 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
church 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
talk 1
so 1
properly 1
that 1
speech 1
was 1
become 1
insipid 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
whithersoever 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
bars 1
and 1
shackles 1
of 1
civilization 1
shut 1
him 1
in 1
and 1
bound 1
him 1
hand 1
and 1
foot 1
he 1
bravely 1
bore 1
his 1
miseries 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
turned 1
up 1
missing 1
for 1
fortyeight 1
hours 1

widow 1
hunted 1
for 1

profoundly 1
concerned 1

searched 1
high 1
and 1
low 1

the 1
third 1

poking 1
among 1
some 1
old 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
down 1
behind 1
the 1
abandoned 1
slaughterhouse 1
and 1
in 1

clad 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
old 1
ruin 1
of 1
rags 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
picturesque 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
free 1

lady 1
narborough 1
said 1
dorian 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
whether 1
like 1
marguerite 1
de 1
navarre 1
she 1
had 1
their 1
hearts 1
embalmed 1
and 1
hung 1
at 1
her 1
girdle 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
she 1
didnt 1
because 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
had 1
any 1
hearts 1
at 1
all 1
four 1
husbands 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
is 1
_trop 1
de 1
zele_ 1
_trop 1
daudace_ 1
i 1
tell 1
her 1
said 1
dorian 1
oh 1
she 1
is 1
audacious 1
enough 1
for 1
anything 1
my 1
dear 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
ferrol 1
like 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
him 1
the 1
husbands 1
of 1
very 1
beautiful 1
women 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
criminal 1
classes 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
sipping 1
his 1
wine 1
lady 1
narborough 1
hit 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
fan 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
surprised 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
says 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
extremely 1
wicked 1
but 1
what 1
world 1
says 1
that 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
it 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
this 1
world 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
on 1
excellent 1
terms 1
everybody 1
i 1
know 1
says 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
wicked 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
serious 1
for 1
some 1
moments 1
it 1
is 1
perfectly 1
monstrous 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
way 1
people 1
go 1
about 1
nowadays 1
saying 1
things 1
against 1
one 1
behind 1
ones 1
back 1
that 1
are 1
absolutely 1
and 1
entirely 1
true 1
isnt 1
he 1
incorrigible 1
cried 1
dorian 1
leaning 1
forward 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
i 1
hope 1
so 1
said 1
his 1
hostess 1
laughing 1
but 1
really 1
if 1
you 1
all 1
worship 1
madame 1
de 1
ferrol 1
in 1
this 1
ridiculous 1
way 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
marry 1
again 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
fashion 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
marry 1
again 1
lady 1
narborough 1
broke 1
in 1
lord 1
henry 1
you 1
were 1
far 1
too 1
happy 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
marries 1
again 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
she 1
detested 1
her 1
first 1
husband 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
marries 1
again 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
he 1
adored 1
his 1
first 1
wife 1
women 1
try 1
their 1
luck 1
men 1
risk 1
theirs 1
narborough 1
wasnt 1
perfect 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
loved 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
lady 1
was 1
the 1
rejoinder 1
women 1
love 1
us 1
for 1
our 1
defects 1
if 1
we 1
have 1
enough 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
will 1
forgive 1
us 1
everything 1
even 1
our 1
intellects 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
dinner 1
again 1
after 1
saying 1
this 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
lady 1
narborough 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
lord 1
henry 1
if 1
we 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
love 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
defects 1
where 1
would 1
you 1
all 1
be 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
would 1
ever 1
be 1
married 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
unfortunate 1
bachelors 1
not 1
however 1
that 1
that 1
would 1
alter 1
you 1
much 1
nowadays 1
all 1
the 1
married 1
men 1
live 1
like 1
bachelors 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
bachelors 1
like 1
married 1
men 1
_fin 1
de 1
siecle_ 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
_fin 1
du 1
globe_ 1
answered 1
his 1
hostess 1
i 1
wish 1
it 1
were 1
_fin 1
du 1
globe_ 1
said 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
disappointment 1
ah 1
my 1
dear 1
cried 1
lady 1
narborough 1
putting 1
on 1
her 1
gloves 1
dont 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
exhausted 1
life 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
says 1
that 1
one 1
knows 1
that 1
life 1
has 1
exhausted 1
him 1
lord 1
henry 1
is 1
very 1
wicked 1
and 1
i 1
sometimes 1
wish 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
to 1
be 1
goodyou 1
look 1
so 1
good 1
i 1
must 1
find 1
you 1
a 1
nice 1
wife 1
lord 1
henry 1
dont 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
mr 1
gray 1
should 1
get 1
married 1
i 1
am 1
always 1
telling 1
him 1
so 1
lady 1
narborough 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
well 1
we 1
must 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
suitable 1
match 1
for 1
him 1
i 1
shall 1
go 1
through 1
debrett 1
carefully 1
tonight 1
and 1
draw 1
out 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
eligible 1
young 1
ladies 1
with 1
their 1
ages 1
lady 1
narborough 1
asked 1
dorian 1
of 1
course 1
with 1
their 1
ages 1
slightly 1
edited 1
but 1
nothing 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
i 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
what 1
_the 1
morning 1
post_ 1
calls 1
a 1
suitable 1
alliance 1
and 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
both 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
what 1
nonsense 1
people 1
talk 1
about 1
happy 1
marriages 1
exclaimed 1
lord 1
henry 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
happy 1
with 1
any 1
woman 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
her 1
ah 1
what 1
a 1
cynic 1
you 1
are 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
pushing 1
back 1
her 1
chair 1
and 1
nodding 1
to 1
lady 1
ruxton 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
soon 1
again 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
an 1
admirable 1
tonic 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
what 1
sir 1
andrew 1
prescribes 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
people 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
meet 1
though 1
i 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
gathering 1
i 1
like 1
men 1
who 1
have 1
a 1
future 1
and 1
women 1
who 1
have 1
a 1
past 1
he 1
answered 1
or 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
petticoat 1
party 1
i 1
fear 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
laughing 1
as 1
she 1
stood 1
up 1
a 1
thousand 1
pardons 1
my 1
dear 1
lady 1
ruxton 1
she 1
added 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
you 1
hadnt 1
finished 1
your 1
cigarette 1
never 1
mind 1
lady 1
narborough 1
i 1
smoke 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
too 1
much 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
limit 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
pray 1
dont 1
lady 1
ruxton 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
moderation 1
is 1
a 1
fatal 1
thing 1
enough 1
is 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
a 1
meal 1
more 1
than 1
enough 1
is 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
a 1
feast 1
lady 1
ruxton 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
curiously 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
explain 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
some 1
afternoon 1
lord 1
henry 1
it 1
sounds 1
a 1
fascinating 1
theory 1
she 1
murmured 1
as 1
she 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
now 1
mind 1
you 1
dont 1
stay 1
too 1
long 1
over 1
your 1
politics 1
and 1
scandal 1
cried 1
lady 1
narborough 1
from 1
the 1
door 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
we 1
are 1
sure 1
to 1
squabble 1
upstairs 1
the 1
men 1
laughed 1
and 1
mr 1
chapman 1
got 1
up 1
solemnly 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
dorian 1
gray 1
changed 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
sat 1
by 1
lord 1
henry 1
mr 1
chapman 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
about 1
the 1
situation 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
commons 1
he 1
guffawed 1
at 1
his 1
adversaries 1
the 1
word 1
_doctrinaire_word 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
to 1
the 1
british 1
mindreappeared 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
between 1
his 1
explosions 1
an 1
alliterative 1
prefix 1
served 1
as 1
an 1
ornament 1
of 1
oratory 1
he 1
hoisted 1
the 1
union 1
jack 1
on 1
the 1
pinnacles 1
of 1
thought 1
the 1
inherited 1
stupidity 1
of 1
the 1
racesound 1
english 1
common 1
sense 1
he 1
jovially 1
termed 1
itwas 1
shown 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
proper 1
bulwark 1
for 1
society 1
a 1
smile 1
curved 1
lord 1
henrys 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
dorian 1
are 1
you 1
better 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
he 1
asked 1
you 1
seemed 1
rather 1
out 1
of 1
sorts 1
at 1
dinner 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
well 1
harry 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
you 1
were 1
charming 1
last 1
night 1
the 1
little 1
duchess 1
is 1
quite 1
devoted 1
to 1
you 1
she 1
tells 1
me 1
she 1

oh 1
yes 1
harry 1
he 1
bores 1
me 1
dreadfully 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
bores 1
her 1
she 1
is 1
very 1
clever 1
too 1
clever 1
for 1
a 1
woman 1
she 1
lacks 1
the 1
indefinable 1
charm 1
of 1
weakness 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
clay 1
that 1
make 1
the 1
gold 1
of 1
the 1
image 1
precious 1
her 1
feet 1
are 1
very 1
pretty 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
feet 1
of 1
clay 1
white 1
porcelain 1
feet 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
through 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
what 1
fire 1
does 1
not 1
destroy 1
it 1
hardens 1
she 1
has 1
had 1
experiences 1
how 1
long 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
married 1
asked 1
dorian 1
an 1
eternity 1
she 1
tells 1
me 1
i 1
believe 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
peerage 1
it 1
is 1
ten 1
years 1
but 1
ten 1
years 1
with 1
monmouth 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
like 1
eternity 1
with 1
time 1
thrown 1
in 1
who 1
else 1

harry 1
he 1
said 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
he 1
drove 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
terror 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
strangled 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
lord 1
henrys 1
casual 1
questioning 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
lose 1
his 1
nerve 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
wanted 1
his 1
nerve 1
still 1
things 1
that 1
were 1
dangerous 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
destroyed 1
he 1
winced 1
he 1
hated 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
even 1
touching 1
them 1
yet 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
library 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
secret 1
press 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
thrust 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
coat 1
and 1
bag 1
a 1
huge 1
fire 1
was 1
blazing 1
he 1
piled 1
another 1
log 1
on 1
it 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
singeing 1
clothes 1
and 1
burning 1
leather 1
was 1
horrible 1
it 1
took 1
him 1
threequarters 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
consume 1
everything 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
he 1
felt 1
faint 1
and 1
sick 1
and 1
having 1
lit 1
some 1
algerian 1
pastilles 1
in 1
a 1
pierced 1
copper 1
brazier 1
he 1
bathed 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
forehead 1
with 1
a 1
cool 1
muskscented 1
vinegar 1
suddenly 1
he 1
started 1
his 1
eyes 1
grew 1
strangely 1
bright 1
and 1
he 1
gnawed 1
nervously 1
at 1
his 1
underlip 1
between 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
stood 1
a 1
large 1
florentine 1
cabinet 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
ebony 1
and 1
inlaid 1
with 1
ivory 1
and 1
blue 1
lapis 1
he 1
watched 1
it 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
could 1
fascinate 1
and 1
make 1
afraid 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
held 1
something 1
that 1
he 1
longed 1
for 1
and 1
yet 1
almost 1
loathed 1
his 1
breath 1
quickened 1
a 1
mad 1
craving 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
he 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
then 1
threw 1
it 1
away 1
his 1
eyelids 1
drooped 1
till 1
the 1
long 1
fringed 1
lashes 1
almost 1
touched 1
his 1
cheek 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
watched 1
the 1
cabinet 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
having 1
unlocked 1
it 1
touched 1
some 1
hidden 1
spring 1
a 1
triangular 1
drawer 1
passed 1
slowly 1
out 1
his 1
fingers 1
moved 1
instinctively 1
towards 1
it 1
dipped 1
in 1
and 1
closed 1
on 1
something 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
chinese 1
box 1
of 1
black 1
and 1
golddust 1
lacquer 1
elaborately 1
wrought 1
the 1
sides 1
patterned 1
with 1
curved 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
silken 1
cords 1
hung 1
with 1
round 1
crystals 1
and 1
tasselled 1
in 1
plaited 1
metal 1
threads 1
he 1
opened 1
it 1
inside 1
was 1
a 1
green 1
paste 1
waxy 1
in 1
lustre 1
the 1
odour 1
curiously 1
heavy 1
and 1
persistent 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
some 1
moments 1
with 1
a 1
strangely 1
immobile 1
smile 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
then 1
shivering 1
though 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
terribly 1
hot 1
he 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
it 1
was 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
to 1
twelve 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
box 1
back 1
shutting 1
the 1
cabinet 1
doors 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
as 1
midnight 1
was 1
striking 1
bronze 1
blows 1
upon 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
dorian 1
gray 1
dressed 1
commonly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
muffler 1
wrapped 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
crept 1
quietly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
house 1
in 1
bond 1
street 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
hansom 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
horse 1
he 1
hailed 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
gave 1
the 1
driver 1
an 1
address 1
the 1
man 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
far 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
muttered 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
sovereign 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
dorian 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
another 1
if 1
you 1
drive 1
fast 1
all 1
right 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
after 1
his 1
fare 1
had 1
got 1
in 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
drove 1
rapidly 1
towards 1
the 1
river 1
chapter 1
16 1
a 1
cold 1
rain 1
began 1
to 1
fall 1
and 1
the 1
blurred 1
streetlamps 1
looked 1
ghastly 1
in 1
the 1
dripping 1
mist 1
the 1
publichouses 1
were 1
just 1
closing 1
and 1
dim 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
were 1
clustering 1
in 1
broken 1
groups 1
round 1
their 1
doors 1
from 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
bars 1
came 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
horrible 1
laughter 1
in 1
others 1
drunkards 1
brawled 1
and 1
screamed 1
lying 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
hansom 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
pulled 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
dorian 1
gray 1
watched 1
with 1
listless 1
eyes 1
the 1
sordid 1
shame 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
repeated 1
to 1
himself 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
they 1
had 1
met 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
yes 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
secret 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
tried 1
it 1
and 1
would 1
try 1
it 1
again 1
now 1
there 1
were 1
opium 1
dens 1
where 1
one 1
could 1
buy 1
oblivion 1
dens 1
of 1
horror 1
where 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
old 1
sins 1
could 1
be 1
destroyed 1
by 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
sins 1
that 1
were 1
new 1
the 1
moon 1
hung 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
like 1
a 1
yellow 1
skull 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
a 1
huge 1
misshapen 1
cloud 1
stretched 1
a 1
long 1
arm 1
across 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
the 1
gaslamps 1
grew 1
fewer 1
and 1
the 1
streets 1
more 1
narrow 1
and 1
gloomy 1
once 1
the 1
man 1
lost 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
drive 1
back 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
a 1
steam 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
horse 1
as 1
it 1
splashed 1
up 1
the 1
puddles 1
the 1
sidewindows 1
of 1
the 1
hansom 1
were 1
clogged 1
with 1
a 1
greyflannel 1
mist 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
how 1
the 1
words 1
rang 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
his 1
soul 1
certainly 1
was 1
sick 1
to 1
death 1
was 1
it 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
senses 1
could 1
cure 1
it 1
innocent 1
blood 1
had 1
been 1
spilled 1
what 1
could 1
atone 1
for 1
that 1
ah 1
for 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
atonement 1
but 1
though 1
forgiveness 1
was 1
impossible 1
forgetfulness 1
was 1
possible 1
still 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
forget 1
to 1
stamp 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
to 1
crush 1
it 1
as 1
one 1
would 1
crush 1
the 1
adder 1
that 1
had 1
stung 1
one 1
indeed 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
basil 1
to 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
who 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
judge 1
over 1
others 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
things 1
that 1
were 1
dreadful 1
horrible 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
endured 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
plodded 1
the 1
hansom 1
going 1
slower 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
each 1
step 1
he 1
thrust 1
up 1
the 1
trap 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
drive 1
faster 1
the 1
hideous 1
hunger 1
for 1
opium 1
began 1
to 1
gnaw 1
at 1
him 1
his 1
throat 1
burned 1
and 1
his 1
delicate 1
hands 1
twitched 1
nervously 1
together 1
he 1
struck 1
at 1
the 1
horse 1
madly 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
the 1
driver 1
laughed 1
and 1
whipped 1
up 1
he 1
laughed 1
in 1
answer 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
silent 1
the 1
way 1
seemed 1
interminable 1
and 1
the 1
streets 1
like 1
the 1
black 1
web 1
of 1
some 1
sprawling 1
spider 1
the 1
monotony 1
became 1
unbearable 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
mist 1
thickened 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
then 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
lonely 1
brickfields 1
the 1
fog 1
was 1
lighter 1
here 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
strange 1
bottleshaped 1
kilns 1
with 1
their 1
orange 1
fanlike 1
tongues 1
of 1
fire 1
a 1
dog 1
barked 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
by 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
some 1
wandering 1
seagull 1
screamed 1
the 1
horse 1
stumbled 1
in 1
a 1
rut 1
then 1
swerved 1
aside 1
and 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
gallop 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
they 1
left 1
the 1
clay 1
road 1
and 1
rattled 1
again 1
over 1
roughpaven 1
streets 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
dark 1
but 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
were 1
silhouetted 1
against 1
some 1
lamplit 1
blind 1
he 1
watched 1
them 1
curiously 1
they 1
moved 1
like 1
monstrous 1
marionettes 1
and 1
made 1
gestures 1
like 1
live 1
things 1
he 1
hated 1
them 1
a 1
dull 1
rage 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
as 1
they 1
turned 1
a 1
corner 1
a 1
woman 1
yelled 1
something 1
at 1
them 1
from 1
an 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
two 1
men 1
ran 1
after 1
the 1
hansom 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
the 1
driver 1
beat 1
at 1
them 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
passion 1
makes 1
one 1
think 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
certainly 1
with 1
hideous 1
iteration 1
the 1
bitten 1
lips 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
shaped 1
and 1
reshaped 1
those 1
subtle 1
words 1
that 1
dealt 1
with 1
soul 1
and 1
sense 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
them 1
the 1
full 1
expression 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
of 1
his 1
mood 1
and 1
justified 1
by 1
intellectual 1
approval 1
passions 1
that 1
without 1
such 1
justification 1
would 1
still 1
have 1
dominated 1
his 1
temper 1
from 1
cell 1
to 1
cell 1
of 1
his 1
brain 1
crept 1
the 1
one 1
thought 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
live 1
most 1
terrible 1
of 1
all 1
mans 1
appetites 1
quickened 1
into 1
force 1
each 1
trembling 1
nerve 1
and 1
fibre 1
ugliness 1
that 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
hateful 1
to 1
him 1
because 1
it 1
made 1
things 1
real 1
became 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
for 1
that 1
very 1
reason 1
ugliness 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
reality 1
the 1
coarse 1
brawl 1
the 1
loathsome 1
den 1
the 1
crude 1
violence 1
of 1
disordered 1
life 1
the 1
very 1
vileness 1
of 1
thief 1
and 1
outcast 1
were 1
more 1
vivid 1
in 1
their 1
intense 1
actuality 1
of 1
impression 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
gracious 1
shapes 1
of 1
art 1
the 1
dreamy 1
shadows 1
of 1
song 1
they 1
were 1
what 1
he 1
needed 1
for 1
forgetfulness 1
in 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
free 1
suddenly 1
the 1
man 1
drew 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
jerk 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
dark 1
lane 1
over 1
the 1
low 1
roofs 1
and 1
jagged 1
chimneystacks 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
rose 1
the 1
black 1
masts 1
of 1
ships 1
wreaths 1
of 1
white 1
mist 1
clung 1
like 1
ghostly 1
sails 1
to 1
the 1
yards 1
somewhere 1
about 1
here 1
sir 1
aint 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
huskily 1
through 1
the 1
trap 1
dorian 1
started 1
and 1
peered 1
round 1
this 1
will 1
do 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
out 1
hastily 1
and 1
given 1
the 1
driver 1
the 1
extra 1
fare 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
him 1
he 1
walked 1
quickly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
quay 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
lantern 1
gleamed 1
at 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
some 1
huge 1
merchantman 1
the 1
light 1
shook 1
and 1
splintered 1
in 1
the 1
puddles 1
a 1
red 1
glare 1
came 1
from 1
an 1
outwardbound 1
steamer 1
that 1
was 1
coaling 1
the 1
slimy 1
pavement 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
wet 1
mackintosh 1
he 1
hurried 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
left 1
glancing 1
back 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
followed 1
in 1
about 1
seven 1
or 1
eight 1
minutes 1
he 1
reached 1
a 1
small 1
shabby 1
house 1
that 1
was 1
wedged 1
in 1
between 1
two 1
gaunt 1
factories 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
topwindows 1
stood 1
a 1
lamp 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
peculiar 1
knock 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
he 1
heard 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
the 1
chain 1
being 1
unhooked 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
quietly 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
the 1
squat 1
misshapen 1
figure 1
that 1
flattened 1
itself 1
into 1
the 1
shadow 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
hung 1
a 1
tattered 1
green 1
curtain 1
that 1
swayed 1
and 1
shook 1
in 1
the 1
gusty 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
followed 1
him 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
he 1
dragged 1
it 1
aside 1
and 1
entered 1
a 1
long 1
low 1
room 1
which 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
a 1
thirdrate 1
dancingsaloon 1
shrill 1
flaring 1
gasjets 1
dulled 1
and 1
distorted 1
in 1
the 1
flyblown 1
mirrors 1
that 1
faced 1
them 1
were 1
ranged 1
round 1
the 1
walls 1
greasy 1
reflectors 1
of 1
ribbed 1
tin 1
backed 1
them 1
making 1
quivering 1
disks 1
of 1
light 1
the 1
floor 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
ochrecoloured 1
sawdust 1
trampled 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
into 1
mud 1
and 1
stained 1
with 1
dark 1
rings 1
of 1
spilled 1
liquor 1
some 1
malays 1
were 1
crouching 1
by 1
a 1
little 1
charcoal 1
stove 1
playing 1
with 1
bone 1
counters 1
and 1
showing 1
their 1
white 1
teeth 1
as 1
they 1
chattered 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
buried 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
a 1
sailor 1
sprawled 1
over 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
tawdrily 1
painted 1
bar 1
that 1
ran 1
across 1
one 1
complete 1
side 1
stood 1
two 1
haggard 1
women 1
mocking 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
brushing 1
the 1
sleeves 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
disgust 1
he 1
thinks 1
hes 1
got 1
red 1
ants 1
on 1
him 1
laughed 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
dorian 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
man 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
terror 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
whimper 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
staircase 1
leading 1
to 1
a 1
darkened 1
chamber 1
as 1
dorian 1
hurried 1
up 1
its 1
three 1
rickety 1
steps 1
the 1
heavy 1
odour 1
of 1
opium 1
met 1
him 1
he 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
and 1
his 1
nostrils 1
quivered 1
with 1
pleasure 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
with 1
smooth 1
yellow 1
hair 1
who 1
was 1
bending 1
over 1
a 1
lamp 1
lighting 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
pipe 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
nodded 1
in 1
a 1
hesitating 1
manner 1
you 1
here 1
adrian 1
muttered 1
dorian 1
where 1
else 1
should 1
i 1
be 1
he 1
answered 1
listlessly 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
chaps 1
will 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
left 1
england 1
darlington 1
is 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
my 1
brother 1
paid 1
the 1
bill 1
at 1
last 1
george 1
doesnt 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
either 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
he 1
added 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
one 1
has 1
this 1
stuff 1
one 1
doesnt 1
want 1
friends 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
too 1
many 1
friends 1
dorian 1
winced 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
grotesque 1
things 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
such 1
fantastic 1
postures 1
on 1
the 1
ragged 1
mattresses 1
the 1
twisted 1
limbs 1
the 1
gaping 1
mouths 1
the 1
staring 1
lustreless 1
eyes 1
fascinated 1
him 1
he 1
knew 1
in 1
what 1
strange 1
heavens 1
they 1
were 1
suffering 1
and 1
what 1
dull 1
hells 1
were 1
teaching 1
them 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
some 1
new 1
joy 1
they 1
were 1
better 1
off 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
was 1
prisoned 1
in 1
thought 1
memory 1
like 1
a 1
horrible 1
malady 1
was 1
eating 1
his 1
soul 1
away 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
basil 1
hallward 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
yet 1
he 1
felt 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stay 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
troubled 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
himself 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
place 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
on 1
the 1
wharf 1
yes 1
that 1
madcat 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
they 1
wont 1
have 1
her 1
in 1
this 1
place 1
now 1
dorian 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
i 1
am 1
sick 1
of 1
women 1
who 1
love 1
one 1
women 1
who 1
hate 1
one 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
interesting 1
besides 1
the 1
stuff 1
is 1
better 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
like 1
it 1
better 1
come 1
and 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
drink 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
anything 1
murmured 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
never 1
mind 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
rose 1
up 1
wearily 1
and 1
followed 1
dorian 1
to 1
the 1
bar 1
a 1
halfcaste 1
in 1
a 1
ragged 1
turban 1
and 1
a 1
shabby 1
ulster 1
grinned 1
a 1
hideous 1
greeting 1
as 1
he 1
thrust 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
two 1
tumblers 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
women 1
sidled 1
up 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
chatter 1
dorian 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
to 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
a 1
crooked 1
smile 1
like 1
a 1
malay 1
crease 1
writhed 1
across 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
proud 1
tonight 1
she 1
sneered 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
dont 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
cried 1
dorian 1
stamping 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
money 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
dont 1
ever 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
again 1
two 1
red 1
sparks 1
flashed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
womans 1
sodden 1
eyes 1
then 1
flickered 1
out 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
dull 1
and 1
glazed 1
she 1
tossed 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
raked 1
the 1
coins 1
off 1
the 1
counter 1
with 1
greedy 1
fingers 1
her 1
companion 1
watched 1
her 1
enviously 1
its 1
no 1
use 1
sighed 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
happy 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
write 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
anything 1
wont 1
you 1
said 1
dorian 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
perhaps 1
good 1
night 1
then 1
good 1
night 1
answered 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
passing 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
wiping 1
his 1
parched 1
mouth 1
with 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
dorian 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
curtain 1
aside 1
a 1
hideous 1
laugh 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
painted 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
money 1
there 1
goes 1
the 1
devils 1
bargain 1
she 1
hiccoughed 1
in 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
curse 1
you 1
he 1
answered 1
dont 1
call 1
me 1
that 1
she 1
snapped 1
her 1
fingers 1
prince 1
charming 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
aint 1
it 1
she 1
yelled 1
after 1
him 1
the 1
drowsy 1
sailor 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
looked 1
wildly 1
round 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
shutting 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
he 1
rushed 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
pursuit 1
dorian 1
gray 1
hurried 1
along 1
the 1
quay 1
through 1
the 1
drizzling 1
rain 1
his 1
meeting 1
with 1
adrian 1
singleton 1
had 1
strangely 1
moved 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
if 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
that 1
young 1
life 1
was 1
really 1
to 1
be 1
laid 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
as 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
such 1
infamy 1
of 1
insult 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
his 1
eyes 1
grew 1
sad 1
yet 1
after 1
all 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
to 1
him 1
ones 1
days 1
were 1
too 1
brief 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
anothers 1
errors 1
on 1
ones 1
shoulders 1
each 1
man 1
lived 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
and 1
paid 1
his 1
own 1
price 1
for 1
living 1
it 1
the 1
only 1
pity 1
was 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
pay 1
so 1
often 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
fault 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
pay 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
indeed 1
in 1
her 1
dealings 1
with 1
man 1
destiny 1
never 1
closed 1
her 1
accounts 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
psychologists 1
tell 1
us 1
when 1
the 1
passion 1
for 1
sin 1
or 1
for 1
what 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
sin 1
so 1
dominates 1
a 1
nature 1
that 1
every 1
fibre 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
as 1
every 1
cell 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
instinct 1
with 1
fearful 1
impulses 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
at 1
such 1
moments 1
lose 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
their 1
will 1
they 1
move 1
to 1
their 1
terrible 1
end 1
as 1
automatons 1
move 1
choice 1
is 1
taken 1
from 1
them 1
and 1
conscience 1
is 1
either 1
killed 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
lives 1
at 1
all 1
lives 1
but 1
to 1
give 1
rebellion 1
its 1
fascination 1
and 1
disobedience 1
its 1
charm 1
for 1
all 1
sins 1
as 1
theologians 1
weary 1
not 1
of 1
reminding 1
us 1
are 1
sins 1
of 1
disobedience 1
when 1
that 1
high 1
spirit 1
that 1
morning 1
star 1
of 1
evil 1
fell 1
from 1
heaven 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
a 1
rebel 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
callous 1
concentrated 1
on 1
evil 1
with 1
stained 1
mind 1
and 1
soul 1
hungry 1
for 1
rebellion 1
dorian 1
gray 1
hastened 1
on 1
quickening 1
his 1
step 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
darted 1
aside 1
into 1
a 1
dim 1
archway 1
that 1
had 1
served 1
him 1
often 1
as 1
a 1
short 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
illfamed 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
he 1
felt 1
himself 1
suddenly 1
seized 1
from 1
behind 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
thrust 1
back 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
a 1
brutal 1
hand 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
he 1
struggled 1
madly 1
for 1
life 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
terrible 1
effort 1
wrenched 1
the 1
tightening 1
fingers 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
click 1
of 1
a 1
revolver 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
a 1
polished 1
barrel 1
pointing 1
straight 1
at 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
dusky 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
short 1
thickset 1
man 1
facing 1
him 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
he 1
gasped 1
keep 1
quiet 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
if 1
you 1
stir 1
i 1
shoot 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
mad 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
done 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
wrecked 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
and 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
was 1
my 1
sister 1
she 1
killed 1
herself 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
her 1
death 1
is 1
at 1
your 1
door 1
i 1
swore 1
i 1
would 1
kill 1
you 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
years 1
i 1
have 1
sought 1
you 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
clue 1
no 1
trace 1
the 1
two 1
people 1
who 1
could 1
have 1
described 1
you 1
were 1
dead 1
i 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
the 1
pet 1
name 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
you 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
tonight 1
by 1
chance 1
make 1
your 1
peace 1
with 1
god 1
for 1
tonight 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
dorian 1
gray 1
grew 1
sick 1
with 1
fear 1
i 1
never 1
knew 1
her 1
he 1
stammered 1
i 1
never 1

for 1

sure 1
as 1

am 1
james 1
vane 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
moment 1
dorian 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
do 1
down 1
on 1
your 1
knees 1
growled 1
the 1
man 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
one 1
minute 1
to 1
make 1
your 1
peaceno 1
more 1

board 1
tonight 1
for 1
india 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
do 1
my 1
job 1
first 1
one 1
minute 1
thats 1
all 1
dorians 1
arms 1
fell 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
paralysed 1
with 1
terror 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
suddenly 1
a 1
wild 1
hope 1
flashed 1
across 1
his 1
brain 1
stop 1
he 1
cried 1
how 1
long 1
ago 1
is 1
it 1
since 1
your 1
sister 1
died 1
quick 1
tell 1
me 1
eighteen 1
years 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
what 1
do 1
years 1
matter 1
eighteen 1
years 1
laughed 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
triumph 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
eighteen 1
years 1
set 1
me 1
under 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
face 1
james 1
vane 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
not 1
understanding 1
what 1
was 1
meant 1
then 1
he 1
seized 1
dorian 1
gray 1
and 1
dragged 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
archway 1
dim 1
and 1
wavering 1
as 1
was 1
the 1
windblown 1
light 1
yet 1
it 1
served 1
to 1
show 1
him 1
the 1
hideous 1
error 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
for 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
kill 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
boyhood 1
all 1
the 1
unstained 1
purity 1
of 1
youth 1
he 1
seemed 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
lad 1
of 1
twenty 1
summers 1
hardly 1
older 1
if 1
older 1
indeed 1
at 1
all 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
been 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
parted 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
destroyed 1
her 1
life 1
he 1
loosened 1
his 1
hold 1
and 1
reeled 1
back 1
my 1
god 1
my 1
god 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
murdered 1
you 1
dorian 1
gray 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
committing 1
a 1
terrible 1
crime 1
my 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
sternly 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
warning 1
to 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
take 1
vengeance 1
into 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
forgive 1
me 1
sir 1
muttered 1
james 1
vane 1
i 1
was 1
deceived 1
a 1
chance 1
word 1
i 1
heard 1
in 1
that 1
damned 1
den 1
set 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
track 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
put 1
that 1
pistol 1
away 1
or 1
you 1
may 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
said 1
dorian 1
turning 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
going 1
slowly 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
james 1
vane 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
in 1
horror 1
he 1
was 1
trembling 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
a 1
black 1
shadow 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
creeping 1
along 1
the 1
dripping 1
wall 1
moved 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
stealthy 1
footsteps 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
hand 1
laid 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
drinking 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
why 1
didnt 1
you 1
kill 1
him 1
she 1
hissed 1
out 1
putting 1
haggard 1
face 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
were 1
following 1
him 1
when 1
you 1
rushed 1
out 1
from 1
dalys 1
you 1
fool 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
killed 1
him 1
he 1
has 1
lots 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
hes 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
bad 1
he 1
is 1

answered 1
and 1
i 1

forty 1
now 1

god 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
his 1
blood 1
upon 1
my 1
hands 1
the 1
woman 1
gave 1
a 1
bitter 1
laugh 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
boy 1
she 1
sneered 1
why 1
man 1
its 1
nigh 1
on 1
eighteen 1
years 1
since 1

the 1
worst 1

say 1
he 1
has 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
devil 1

with 1
a 1
sickly 1
leer 1
you 1

this 1
i 1
swear 1
it 1
came 1
in 1
hoarse 1
echo 1
from 1
her 1
flat 1
mouth 1
but 1
dont 1

me 1
away 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
whined 1

of 1

me 1
have 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
my 1
nights 1
lodging 1
he 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
with 1
an 1
oath 1
and 1
rushed 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
dorian 1
gray 1
had 1
disappeared 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1

woman 1
had 1
vanished 1

chapter 1
17 1
a 1
week 1
later 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
conservatory 1
at 1
selby 1
royal 1
talking 1
to 1
the 1
pretty 1
duchess 1
of 1
monmouth 1
who 1
with 1
her 1
husband 1
a 1
jadedlooking 1
man 1
of 1
sixty 1
was 1
amongst 1
his 1
guests 1
it 1
was 1
teatime 1
and 1
the 1
mellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
lacecovered 1
lamp 1
that 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
delicate 1
china 1
and 1
hammered 1
silver 1
of 1
the 1
service 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
duchess 1
was 1
presiding 1
her 1
white 1
hands 1
were 1
moving 1
daintily 1
among 1
the 1
cups 1
and 1
her 1
full 1
red 1
lips 1
were 1
smiling 1
at 1
something 1
that 1
dorian 1
had 1
whispered 1
to 1
her 1
lord 1
henry 1
was 1
lying 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
silkdraped 1
wicker 1
chair 1
looking 1
at 1
them 1
on 1
a 1
peachcoloured 1
divan 1
sat 1
lady 1
narborough 1
pretending 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
dukes 1
description 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
brazilian 1
beetle 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
added 1
to 1
his 1
collection 1
three 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
elaborate 1
smokingsuits 1
were 1
handing 1
teacakes 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
the 1
houseparty 1
consisted 1
of 1
twelve 1
people 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
more 1
expected 1
to 1
arrive 1
on 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
two 1
talking 1
about 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
strolling 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
cup 1
down 1
i 1
hope 1
dorian 1
has 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
my 1
plan 1
for 1
rechristening 1
everything 1
gladys 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
delightful 1
idea 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
rechristened 1
harry 1
rejoined 1
the 1
duchess 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
wonderful 1
eyes 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
satisfied 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
name 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
mr 1
gray 1
should 1
be 1
satisfied 1
with 1
his 1
my 1
dear 1
gladys 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
alter 1
either 1
name 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
they 1
are 1
both 1
perfect 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
chiefly 1
of 1
flowers 1
yesterday 1
i 1
cut 1
an 1
orchid 1
for 1
my 1
buttonhole 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
marvellous 1
spotted 1
thing 1
as 1
effective 1
as 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
sins 1
in 1
a 1
thoughtless 1
moment 1
i 1
asked 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
gardeners 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
specimen 1
of 1
_robinsoniana_ 1
or 1
something 1
dreadful 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sad 1
truth 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
faculty 1
of 1
giving 1
lovely 1
names 1
to 1
things 1
names 1
are 1
everything 1
i 1
never 1
quarrel 1
with 1
actions 1
my 1
one 1
quarrel 1
is 1
with 1
words 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
i 1
hate 1
vulgar 1
realism 1
in 1
literature 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
call 1
a 1
spade 1
a 1
spade 1
should 1
be 1
compelled 1
to 1
use 1
one 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
he 1
is 1
fit 1
for 1
then 1
what 1
should 1
we 1
call 1
you 1
harry 1
she 1
asked 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
prince 1
paradox 1
said 1
dorian 1
i 1
recognize 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
flash 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
duchess 1
i 1
wont 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
laughed 1
lord 1
henry 1
sinking 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
from 1
a 1
label 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
escape 1
i 1
refuse 1
the 1
title 1
royalties 1
may 1
not 1
abdicate 1
fell 1
as 1
a 1
warning 1
from 1
pretty 1
lips 1
you 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
defend 1
my 1
throne 1
then 1
yes 1
i 1
give 1
the 1
truths 1
of 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
prefer 1
the 1
mistakes 1
of 1
today 1
she 1
answered 1
you 1
disarm 1
me 1
gladys 1
he 1
cried 1
catching 1
the 1
wilfulness 1
of 1
her 1
mood 1
of 1
your 1
shield 1
harry 1
not 1
of 1
your 1
spear 1
i 1
never 1
tilt 1
against 1
beauty 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
that 1
is 1
your 1
error 1
harry 1
believe 1
me 1
you 1
value 1
beauty 1
far 1
too 1
much 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
admit 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
be 1
beautiful 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
no 1
one 1
is 1
more 1
ready 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
ugly 1
ugliness 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
sins 1
then 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
what 1
becomes 1
of 1
your 1
simile 1
about 1
the 1
orchid 1
ugliness 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
virtues 1
gladys 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
tory 1
must 1
not 1
underrate 1
them 1
beer 1
the 1
bible 1
and 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
virtues 1
have 1
made 1
our 1
england 1
what 1
she 1
is 1
you 1
dont 1
like 1
your 1
country 1
then 1
she 1
asked 1
i 1
live 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
censure 1
it 1
the 1
better 1
would 1
you 1
have 1
me 1
take 1
the 1
verdict 1
of 1
europe 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
inquired 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
say 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
tartuffe 1
has 1
emigrated 1
to 1
england 1
and 1
opened 1
a 1
shop 1
is 1
that 1
yours 1
harry 1
i 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
use 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
true 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
our 1
countrymen 1
never 1
recognize 1
a 1
description 1
they 1
are 1
practical 1
they 1
are 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
practical 1
when 1
they 1
make 1
up 1
their 1
ledger 1
they 1
balance 1
stupidity 1
by 1
wealth 1
and 1
vice 1
by 1
hypocrisy 1
still 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
great 1
things 1
great 1
things 1
have 1
been 1
thrust 1
on 1
us 1
gladys 1
we 1
have 1
carried 1
their 1
burden 1
only 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
stock 1
exchange 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
i 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
race 1
she 1
cried 1
it 1
represents 1
the 1
survival 1
of 1
the 1
pushing 1
it 1
has 1
development 1
decay 1
fascinates 1
me 1
more 1
what 1
of 1
art 1
she 1
asked 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
malady 1
love 1
an 1
illusion 1
religion 1
the 1
fashionable 1
substitute 1
for 1
belief 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
sceptic 1
never 1
scepticism 1
is 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
faith 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
to 1
define 1
is 1
to 1
limit 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
clue 1
threads 1
snap 1
you 1
would 1
lose 1
your 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
labyrinth 1
you 1
bewilder 1
me 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
our 1
host 1
is 1
a 1
delightful 1
topic 1
years 1
ago 1
he 1
was 1
christened 1
prince 1
charming 1
ah 1
dont 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
that 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
our 1
host 1
is 1
rather 1
horrid 1
this 1
evening 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
colouring 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
thinks 1
that 1
monmouth 1
married 1
me 1
on 1
purely 1
scientific 1
principles 1
as 1
the 1
best 1
specimen 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
of 1
a 1
modern 1
butterfly 1
well 1
i 1
hope 1
he 1
wont 1
stick 1
pins 1
into 1
you 1
duchess 1
laughed 1
dorian 1
oh 1
my 1
maid 1
does 1
that 1
already 1
mr 1
gray 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
annoyed 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
get 1
annoyed 1
with 1
you 1
about 1
duchess 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
trivial 1
things 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
usually 1
because 1
i 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
ten 1
minutes 1
to 1
nine 1
and 1
tell 1
her 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
dressed 1
by 1
halfpast 1
eight 1
how 1
unreasonable 1
of 1
her 1
you 1
should 1
give 1
her 1
warning 1
i 1
darent 1
mr 1
gray 1
why 1
she 1
invents 1
hats 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
one 1
i 1
wore 1
at 1
lady 1
hilstones 1
gardenparty 1
you 1
dont 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
nice 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
well 1
she 1
made 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
nothing 1
all 1
good 1
hats 1
are 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
nothing 1
like 1
all 1
good 1
reputations 1
gladys 1
interrupted 1
lord 1
henry 1
every 1
effect 1
that 1
one 1
produces 1
gives 1
one 1
an 1
enemy 1
to 1
be 1
popular 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
mediocrity 1
not 1
with 1
women 1
said 1
the 1
duchess 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
women 1
rule 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
we 1
cant 1
bear 1
mediocrities 1
we 1
women 1
as 1
some 1
one 1
says 1
love 1
with 1
our 1
ears 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
men 1
love 1
with 1
your 1
eyes 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
love 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
we 1
never 1
do 1
anything 1
else 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
ah 1
then 1
you 1
never 1
really 1
love 1
mr 1
gray 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
with 1
mock 1
sadness 1
my 1
dear 1
gladys 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
romance 1
lives 1
by 1
repetition 1
and 1
repetition 1
converts 1
an 1
appetite 1
into 1
an 1
art 1
besides 1
each 1
time 1
that 1
one 1
loves 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
time 1
one 1
has 1
ever 1
loved 1
difference 1
of 1
object 1
does 1
not 1
alter 1
singleness 1
of 1
passion 1
it 1
merely 1
intensifies 1
it 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
in 1
life 1
but 1
one 1
great 1
experience 1
at 1
best 1
and 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
to 1
reproduce 1
that 1
experience 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
possible 1
even 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
wounded 1
by 1
it 1
harry 1
asked 1
the 1
duchess 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
especially 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
wounded 1
by 1
it 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
the 1
duchess 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
a 1
curious 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
to 1
that 1
mr 1
gray 1
she 1
inquired 1
dorian 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
and 1
laughed 1
i 1
always 1
agree 1
with 1
harry 1
duchess 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
wrong 1
harry 1
is 1
never 1
wrong 1
duchess 1
and 1
does 1
his 1
philosophy 1
make 1
you 1
happy 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
searched 1
for 1
happiness 1
who 1
wants 1
happiness 1
i 1
have 1
searched 1
for 1
pleasure 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
mr 1
gray 1
often 1
too 1
often 1
the 1
duchess 1
sighed 1
i 1
am 1
searching 1
for 1
peace 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
dont 1
go 1
and 1
dress 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
none 1
this 1
evening 1
let 1
me 1
get 1
you 1
some 1
orchids 1
duchess 1
cried 1
dorian 1
starting 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
walking 1
down 1
the 1
conservatory 1
you 1
are 1
flirting 1
disgracefully 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
to 1
his 1
cousin 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
care 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
fascinating 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
not 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
battle 1
greek 1
meets 1
greek 1
then 1
i 1
am 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
trojans 1
they 1
fought 1
for 1
a 1
woman 1
they 1
were 1
defeated 1
there 1
are 1
worse 1
things 1
than 1
capture 1
she 1
answered 1
you 1
gallop 1
with 1
a 1
loose 1
rein 1
pace 1
gives 1
life 1
was 1
the 1
_riposte_ 1
i 1
shall 1
write 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
diary 1
tonight 1
what 1
that 1
a 1
burnt 1
child 1
loves 1
the 1
fire 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
even 1
singed 1
my 1
wings 1
are 1
untouched 1
you 1
use 1
them 1
for 1
everything 1
except 1
flight 1
courage 1
has 1
passed 1
from 1
men 1
to 1
women 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
new 1
experience 1
for 1
us 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
rival 1
who 1
he 1
laughed 1
lady 1
narborough 1
he 1
whispered 1
she 1
perfectly 1
adores 1
him 1
you 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
apprehension 1
the 1
appeal 1
to 1
antiquity 1
is 1
fatal 1
to 1
us 1
who 1
are 1
romanticists 1
romanticists 1
you 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
science 1
men 1
have 1
educated 1
us 1
but 1
not 1
explained 1
you 1
describe 1
us 1
as 1
a 1
sex 1
was 1
her 1
challenge 1
sphinxes 1
without 1
secrets 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
smiling 1
how 1
long 1
mr 1
gray 1
is 1
she 1
said 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
help 1
him 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
my 1
frock 1
ah 1
you 1
must 1
suit 1
your 1
frock 1
to 1
his 1
flowers 1
gladys 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
premature 1
surrender 1
romantic 1
art 1
begins 1
with 1
its 1
climax 1
i 1
must 1
keep 1
an 1
opportunity 1
for 1
retreat 1
in 1
the 1
parthian 1
manner 1
they 1
found 1
safety 1
in 1
the 1
desert 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
that 1
women 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
allowed 1
a 1
choice 1
he 1
answered 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
he 1
finished 1
the 1
sentence 1
before 1
from 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
conservatory 1
came 1
a 1
stifled 1
groan 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
dull 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
heavy 1
fall 1
everybody 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
duchess 1
stood 1
motionless 1
in 1
horror 1
and 1
with 1
fear 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
lord 1
henry 1
rushed 1
through 1
the 1
flapping 1
palms 1
to 1
find 1
dorian 1
gray 1
lying 1
face 1
downwards 1
on 1
the 1
tiled 1
floor 1
in 1
a 1
deathlike 1
swoon 1
he 1
was 1
carried 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
blue 1
drawingroom 1
and 1
laid 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sofas 1
after 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
with 1
a 1
dazed 1
expression 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
he 1
asked 1
oh 1
i 1
remember 1
am 1
i 1
safe 1
here 1
harry 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
tremble 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
you 1
merely 1
fainted 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
overtired 1
yourself 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
not 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
dinner 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
your 1
place 1
no 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
down 1
he 1
said 1
struggling 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
come 1
down 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
alone 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
dressed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
recklessness 1
of 1
gaiety 1
in 1
his 1
manner 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
table 1
but 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
conservatory 1
like 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
james 1
vane 1
watching 1
him 1
chapter 1
18 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
indeed 1
spent 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
sick 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
terror 1
of 1
dying 1
and 1
yet 1
indifferent 1
to 1
life 1
itself 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
being 1
hunted 1
snared 1
tracked 1
down 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
dominate 1
him 1
if 1
the 1
tapestry 1
did 1
but 1
tremble 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
he 1
shook 1
the 1
dead 1
leaves 1
that 1
were 1
blown 1
against 1
the 1
leaded 1
panes 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
his 1
own 1
wasted 1
resolutions 1
and 1
wild 1
regrets 1
when 1
he 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
saw 1
again 1
the 1
sailors 1
face 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
miststained 1
glass 1
and 1
horror 1
seemed 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
lay 1
its 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
heart 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
only 1
his 1
fancy 1
that 1
had 1
called 1
vengeance 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
hideous 1
shapes 1
of 1
punishment 1
before 1
him 1
actual 1
life 1
was 1
chaos 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
terribly 1
logical 1
in 1
the 1
imagination 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
imagination 1
that 1
set 1
remorse 1
to 1
dog 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
sin 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
imagination 1
that 1
made 1
each 1
crime 1
bear 1
its 1
misshapen 1
brood 1
in 1
the 1
common 1
world 1
of 1
fact 1
the 1
wicked 1
were 1
not 1
punished 1
nor 1
the 1
good 1
rewarded 1
success 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
strong 1
failure 1
thrust 1
upon 1
the 1
weak 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
besides 1
had 1
any 1
stranger 1
been 1
prowling 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
seen 1
by 1
the 1
servants 1
or 1
the 1
keepers 1
had 1
any 1
footmarks 1
been 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
flowerbeds 1
the 1
gardeners 1
would 1
have 1
reported 1
it 1
yes 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
merely 1
fancy 1
sibyl 1
vanes 1
brother 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
sailed 1
away 1
in 1
his 1
ship 1
to 1
founder 1
in 1
some 1
winter 1
sea 1
from 1
him 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
why 1
the 1
man 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
could 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
youth 1
had 1
saved 1
him 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
merely 1
an 1
illusion 1
how 1
terrible 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
conscience 1
could 1
raise 1
such 1
fearful 1
phantoms 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
visible 1
form 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
move 1
before 1
one 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
would 1
his 1
be 1
if 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
shadows 1
of 1
his 1
crime 1
were 1
to 1
peer 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
silent 1
corners 1
to 1
mock 1
him 1
from 1
secret 1
places 1
to 1
whisper 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
to 1
wake 1
him 1
with 1
icy 1
fingers 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
asleep 1
as 1
the 1
thought 1
crept 1
through 1
his 1
brain 1
he 1
grew 1
pale 1
with 1
terror 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
suddenly 1
colder 1
oh 1
in 1
what 1
a 1
wild 1
hour 1
of 1
madness 1
he 1
had 1
killed 1
his 1
friend 1
how 1
ghastly 1
the 1
mere 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
again 1
each 1
hideous 1
detail 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
added 1
horror 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
cave 1
of 1
time 1
terrible 1
and 1
swathed 1
in 1
scarlet 1
rose 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
his 1
sin 1
when 1
lord 1
henry 1
came 1
in 1
at 1
six 1
oclock 1
he 1
found 1
him 1
crying 1
as 1
one 1
whose 1
heart 1
will 1
break 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
till 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
that 1
he 1
ventured 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
clear 1
pinescented 1
air 1
of 1
that 1
winter 1
morning 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
his 1
joyousness 1
and 1
his 1
ardour 1
for 1
life 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
merely 1
the 1
physical 1
conditions 1
of 1
environment 1
that 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
change 1
his 1
own 1
nature 1
had 1
revolted 1
against 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
maim 1
and 1
mar 1
the 1
perfection 1
of 1
its 1
calm 1
with 1
subtle 1
and 1
finely 1
wrought 1
temperaments 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
so 1
their 1
strong 1
passions 1
must 1
either 1
bruise 1
or 1
bend 1
they 1
either 1
slay 1
the 1
man 1
or 1
themselves 1
die 1
shallow 1
sorrows 1
and 1
shallow 1
loves 1
live 1
on 1
the 1
loves 1
and 1
sorrows 1
that 1
are 1
great 1
are 1
destroyed 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
plenitude 1
besides 1
he 1
had 1
convinced 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
terrorstricken 1
imagination 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
now 1
on 1
his 1
fears 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
pity 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
contempt 1
after 1
breakfast 1
he 1
walked 1
with 1
the 1
duchess 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
across 1
the 1
park 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
shootingparty 1
the 1
crisp 1
frost 1
lay 1
like 1
salt 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
an 1
inverted 1
cup 1
of 1
blue 1
metal 1
a 1
thin 1
film 1
of 1
ice 1
bordered 1
the 1
flat 1
reedgrown 1
lake 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
pinewood 1
he 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
sir 1
geoffrey 1
clouston 1
the 1
duchesss 1
brother 1
jerking 1
two 1
spent 1
cartridges 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
gun 1
he 1
jumped 1
from 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
having 1
told 1
the 1
groom 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
mare 1
home 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
towards 1
his 1
guest 1
through 1
the 1
withered 1
bracken 1
and 1
rough 1
undergrowth 1
have 1
you 1
had 1
good 1
sport 1
geoffrey 1
he 1
asked 1
not 1
very 1
good 1
dorian 1
i 1
think 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
after 1
lunch 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
new 1
ground 1
dorian 1
strolled 1
along 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
the 1
keen 1
aromatic 1
air 1
the 1
brown 1
and 1
red 1
lights 1
that 1
glimmered 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
the 1
hoarse 1
cries 1
of 1
the 1
beaters 1
ringing 1
out 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
sharp 1
snaps 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
that 1
followed 1
fascinated 1
him 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
delightful 1
freedom 1
he 1
was 1
dominated 1
by 1
the 1
carelessness 1
of 1
happiness 1
by 1
the 1
high 1
indifference 1
of 1
joy 1
suddenly 1
from 1
a 1
lumpy 1
tussock 1
of 1
old 1
grass 1
some 1
twenty 1
yards 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
blacktipped 1
ears 1
erect 1
and 1
long 1
hinder 1
limbs 1
throwing 1
it 1
forward 1
started 1
a 1
hare 1
it 1
bolted 1
for 1
a 1
thicket 1
of 1
alders 1
sir 1
geoffrey 1
put 1
his 1
gun 1
to 1
his 1
shoulder 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
animals 1
grace 1
of 1
movement 1
that 1
strangely 1
charmed 1
dorian 1
gray 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
dont 1
shoot 1
it 1
geoffrey 1
let 1
it 1
live 1
what 1
nonsense 1
dorian 1
laughed 1
his 1
companion 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
hare 1
bounded 1
into 1
the 1
thicket 1
he 1
fired 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
cries 1
heard 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
hare 1
in 1
pain 1
which 1
is 1
dreadful 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
agony 1
which 1
is 1
worse 1
good 1
heavens 1
i 1
have 1
hit 1
a 1
beater 1
exclaimed 1
sir 1
geoffrey 1
what 1
an 1
ass 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
stop 1
shooting 1
there 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
hurt 1
the 1
headkeeper 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
where 1
sir 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
he 1
shouted 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
the 1
firing 1
ceased 1
along 1
the 1
line 1
here 1
answered 1
sir 1
geoffrey 1
angrily 1
hurrying 1
towards 1
the 1
thicket 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
dont 1
you 1
keep 1
your 1
men 1
back 1
spoiled 1
my 1
shooting 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
dorian 1
watched 1
them 1
as 1
they 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
alderclump 1
brushing 1
the 1
lithe 1
swinging 1
branches 1
aside 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
they 1
emerged 1
dragging 1
a 1
body 1
after 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sunlight 1
he 1
turned 1
away 1
in 1
horror 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
misfortune 1
followed 1
wherever 1
he 1
went 1
he 1
heard 1
sir 1
geoffrey 1
ask 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
really 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
affirmative 1
answer 1
of 1
the 1
keeper 1
the 1
wood 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
suddenly 1
alive 1
with 1
faces 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
trampling 1
of 1
myriad 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
low 1
buzz 1
of 1
voices 1
a 1
great 1
copperbreasted 1
pheasant 1
came 1
beating 1
through 1
the 1
boughs 1
overhead 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
momentsthat 1
were 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
perturbed 1
state 1
like 1
endless 1
hours 1
of 1
painhe 1
felt 1
a 1
hand 1
laid 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
he 1
started 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
the 1
shooting 1
is 1
stopped 1
for 1
today 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
well 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
i 1
wish 1
it 1
were 1
stopped 1
for 1
ever 1
harry 1
he 1
answered 1
bitterly 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
hideous 1
and 1
cruel 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
finish 1
the 1
sentence 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
rejoined 1
lord 1
henry 1
he 1
got 1
the 1
whole 1
charge 1
of 1
shot 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
died 1
almost 1
instantaneously 1
come 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
home 1
they 1
walked 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
for 1
nearly 1
fifty 1
yards 1
without 1
speaking 1
then 1
dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
and 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
sigh 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
bad 1
omen 1
harry 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
omen 1
what 1
is 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
oh 1
this 1
accident 1
i 1
suppose 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
it 1
cant 1
be 1
helped 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
mans 1
own 1
fault 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
get 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
besides 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
us 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
awkward 1
for 1
geoffrey 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
do 1
to 1
pepper 1
beaters 1
it 1
makes 1
people 1
think 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
a 1
wild 1
shot 1
and 1
geoffrey 1
is 1
not 1
he 1
shoots 1
very 1
straight 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
talking 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
bad 1
omen 1
harry 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
something 1
horrible 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
us 1
to 1
myself 1
perhaps 1
he 1
added 1
passing 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
pain 1
the 1
elder 1
man 1
laughed 1
the 1
only 1
horrible 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
_ennui_ 1
dorian 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
sin 1
for 1
which 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
forgiveness 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
suffer 1
from 1
it 1
unless 1
these 1
fellows 1
keep 1
chattering 1
about 1
this 1
thing 1
at 1
dinner 1
i 1
must 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
the 1
subject 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
tabooed 1
as 1
for 1
omens 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
an 1
omen 1
destiny 1
does 1
not 1
send 1
us 1
heralds 1
she 1
is 1
too 1
wise 1
or 1
too 1
cruel 1
for 1
that 1
besides 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
could 1
happen 1
to 1
you 1
dorian 1
you 1
have 1
everything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
want 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
delighted 1
to 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
change 1
places 1
harry 1
dont 1
laugh 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
telling 1
you 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
wretched 1
peasant 1
who 1
has 1
just 1
died 1
is 1
better 1
off 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
terror 1
of 1
death 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
death 1
that 1
terrifies 1
me 1
its 1
monstrous 1
wings 1
seem 1
to 1
wheel 1
in 1
the 1
leaden 1
air 1
around 1
me 1
good 1
heavens 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
moving 1
behind 1
the 1
trees 1
there 1
watching 1
me 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
trembling 1
gloved 1
hand 1
was 1
pointing 1
yes 1
he 1
said 1
smiling 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
gardener 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
suppose 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
what 1
flowers 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
tonight 1
how 1
absurdly 1
nervous 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
doctor 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
dorian 1
heaved 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
gardener 1
approaching 1
the 1
man 1
touched 1
his 1
hat 1
glanced 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
in 1
a 1
hesitating 1
manner 1
and 1
then 1
produced 1
a 1
letter 1
which 1
he 1
handed 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
her 1
grace 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
he 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
put 1
the 1
letter 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
tell 1
her 1
grace 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
coming 1
in 1
he 1
said 1
coldly 1
the 1
man 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
went 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
how 1
fond 1
women 1
are 1
of 1
doing 1
dangerous 1
things 1
laughed 1
lord 1
henry 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
qualities 1
in 1
them 1
that 1
i 1
admire 1
most 1
a 1
woman 1
will 1
flirt 1
with 1
anybody 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
other 1
people 1
are 1
looking 1
on 1
how 1
fond 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
saying 1
dangerous 1
things 1
harry 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
instance 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
astray 1
i 1
like 1
the 1
duchess 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
love 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
duchess 1
loves 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
she 1
likes 1
you 1
less 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
excellently 1
matched 1
you 1
are 1
talking 1
scandal 1
harry 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
never 1
any 1
basis 1
for 1
scandal 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
every 1
scandal 1
is 1
an 1
immoral 1
certainty 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
lighting 1
a 1
cigarette 1
you 1
would 1
sacrifice 1
anybody 1
harry 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
an 1
epigram 1
the 1
world 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
love 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
a 1
deep 1
note 1
of 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
but 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
passion 1
and 1
forgotten 1
the 1
desire 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
much 1
concentrated 1
on 1
myself 1
my 1
own 1
personality 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
escape 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
to 1
forget 1
it 1
was 1
silly 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
shall 1
send 1
a 1
wire 1
to 1
harvey 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
yacht 1
got 1
ready 1
on 1
a 1
yacht 1
one 1
is 1
safe 1
safe 1
from 1
what 1
dorian 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
some 1
trouble 1
why 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
would 1
help 1
you 1
i 1
cant 1
tell 1
you 1
harry 1
he 1
answered 1
sadly 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
fancy 1
of 1
mine 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
has 1
upset 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
horrible 1
presentiment 1
that 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
may 1
happen 1
to 1
me 1
what 1
nonsense 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
feeling 1
it 1
ah 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
duchess 1
looking 1
like 1
artemis 1
in 1
a 1
tailormade 1
gown 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
back 1
duchess 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
mr 1
gray 1
she 1
answered 1
poor 1
geoffrey 1
is 1
terribly 1
upset 1
and 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
you 1
asked 1
him 1
not 1
to 1
shoot 1
the 1
hare 1
how 1
curious 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
curious 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
made 1
me 1
say 1
it 1
some 1
whim 1
i 1
suppose 1
it 1
looked 1
the 1
loveliest 1
of 1
little 1
live 1
things 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
they 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
the 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
hideous 1
subject 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
annoying 1
subject 1
broke 1
in 1
lord 1
henry 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
psychological 1
value 1
at 1
all 1
now 1
if 1
geoffrey 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
thing 1
on 1
purpose 1
how 1
interesting 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
committed 1
a 1
real 1
murder 1
how 1
horrid 1
of 1
you 1
harry 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
isnt 1
it 1
mr 1
gray 1
harry 1
mr 1
gray 1
is 1
ill 1
again 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
faint 1
dorian 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
with 1
an 1
effort 1
and 1
smiled 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
duchess 1
he 1
murmured 1
my 1
nerves 1
are 1
dreadfully 1
out 1
of 1
order 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
walked 1
too 1
far 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
didnt 1
hear 1
what 1
harry 1
said 1
was 1
it 1
very 1
bad 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
some 1
other 1
time 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
and 1
lie 1
down 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
wont 1
you 1
they 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
great 1
flight 1
of 1
steps 1
that 1
led 1
from 1
the 1
conservatory 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
terrace 1
as 1
the 1
glass 1
door 1
closed 1
behind 1
dorian 1
lord 1
henry 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
duchess 1
with 1
his 1
slumberous 1
eyes 1
are 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
asked 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
landscape 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
knew 1
she 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
knowledge 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
uncertainty 1
that 1
charms 1
one 1
a 1
mist 1
makes 1
things 1
wonderful 1
one 1
may 1
lose 1
ones 1
way 1
all 1
ways 1
end 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
point 1
my 1
dear 1
gladys 1

of 1
strawberry 1
leaves 1

he 1
never 1

i 1
wish 1
he 1
had 1

he 1
glanced 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
something 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
looking 1
for 1
she 1
inquired 1
the 1
button 1
from 1
your 1
foil 1
he 1
answered 1
you 1
have 1
dropped 1
it 1
she 1
laughed 1
i 1

still 1
the 1
mask 1

makes 1
your 1
eyes 1

was 1
his 1
reply 1
she 1
laughed 1
again 1
her 1
teeth 1
showed 1
like 1
white 1
seeds 1
in 1
a 1
scarlet 1
fruit 1
upstairs 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
lying 1
on 1
a 1
sofa 1
with 1
terror 1
in 1
every 1
tingling 1
fibre 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
life 1
had 1
suddenly 1
become 1
too 1
hideous 1
a 1
burden 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
dreadful 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
unlucky 1
beater 1
shot 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
animal 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
prefigure 1
death 1
for 1
himself 1
also 1
he 1
had 1
nearly 1
swooned 1
at 1
what 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
chance 1
mood 1
of 1
cynical 1
jesting 1
at 1
five 1
oclock 1
he 1
rang 1
his 1
bell 1
for 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
orders 1
to 1
pack 1
his 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
nightexpress 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
brougham 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
by 1
eightthirty 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
not 1
to 1
sleep 1
another 1
night 1
at 1
selby 1
royal 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
illomened 1
place 1
death 1
walked 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
the 1
grass 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
had 1
been 1
spotted 1
with 1
blood 1
then 1
he 1
wrote 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
lord 1
henry 1
telling 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
consult 1
his 1
doctor 1
and 1
asking 1
him 1
to 1
entertain 1
his 1
guests 1
in 1
his 1
absence 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
putting 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
envelope 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
his 1
valet 1
informed 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
headkeeper 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
frowned 1
and 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
send 1
him 1
in 1
he 1
muttered 1
after 1
some 1
moments 1
hesitation 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
entered 1
dorian 1
pulled 1
his 1
chequebook 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
drawer 1
and 1
spread 1
it 1
out 1
before 1
him 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
about 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
of 1
this 1
morning 1
thornton 1
he 1
said 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
pen 1
yes 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
gamekeeper 1
was 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
married 1
had 1
he 1
any 1
people 1
dependent 1
on 1
him 1
asked 1
dorian 1
looking 1
bored 1
if 1
so 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
in 1
want 1
and 1
will 1
send 1
them 1
any 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
necessary 1
we 1
dont 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
sir 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
coming 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
dont 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
dorian 1
listlessly 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
wasnt 1
he 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
men 1
no 1
sir 1
never 1
saw 1
him 1
before 1
seems 1
like 1
a 1
sailor 1
sir 1
the 1
pen 1
dropped 1
from 1
dorian 1
grays 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
suddenly 1
stopped 1
beating 1
a 1
sailor 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
a 1
sailor 1
yes 1
sir 1
he 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sailor 1
tattooed 1
on 1
both 1
arms 1
and 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
was 1
there 1
anything 1
found 1
on 1
him 1
said 1
dorian 1
leaning 1
forward 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
startled 1
eyes 1
anything 1
that 1
would 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
some 1
money 1
sirnot 1
much 1
and 1
a 1
sixshooter 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
name 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
a 1
decentlooking 1
man 1
sir 1
but 1
roughlike 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sailor 1
we 1
think 1
dorian 1
started 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
a 1
terrible 1
hope 1
fluttered 1
past 1
him 1
he 1
clutched 1
at 1
it 1
madly 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
body 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
quick 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
stable 1
in 1
the 1
home 1
farm 1
sir 1
the 1
folk 1
dont 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
in 1
their 1
houses 1
they 1
say 1
a 1
corpse 1
brings 1
bad 1
luck 1
the 1
home 1
farm 1
go 1
there 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
meet 1
me 1
tell 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
grooms 1
to 1
bring 1
my 1
horse 1
round 1
no 1
never 1
mind 1
ill 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
myself 1
it 1
will 1
save 1
time 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
galloping 1
down 1
the 1
long 1
avenue 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
the 1
trees 1
seemed 1
to 1
sweep 1
past 1
him 1
in 1
spectral 1
procession 1
and 1
wild 1
shadows 1
to 1
fling 1
themselves 1
across 1
his 1
path 1
once 1
the 1
mare 1
swerved 1
at 1
a 1
white 1
gatepost 1
and 1
nearly 1
threw 1
him 1
he 1
lashed 1
her 1
across 1
the 1
neck 1
with 1
his 1
crop 1
she 1
cleft 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
like 1
an 1
arrow 1
the 1
stones 1
flew 1
from 1
her 1
hoofs 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
home 1
farm 1
two 1
men 1
were 1
loitering 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
he 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
saddle 1
and 1
threw 1
the 1
reins 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
farthest 1
stable 1
a 1
light 1
was 1
glimmering 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
hurried 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
latch 1
there 1
he 1
paused 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
feeling 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
a 1
discovery 1
that 1
would 1
either 1
make 1
or 1
mar 1
his 1
life 1
then 1
he 1
thrust 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
and 1
entered 1
on 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
sacking 1
in 1
the 1
far 1
corner 1
was 1
lying 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
coarse 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
blue 1
trousers 1
a 1
spotted 1
handkerchief 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
over 1
the 1
face 1
a 1
coarse 1
candle 1
stuck 1
in 1
a 1
bottle 1
sputtered 1
beside 1
it 1
dorian 1
gray 1
shuddered 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
his 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
away 1
and 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
farmservants 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
take 1
that 1
thing 1
off 1
the 1
face 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
clutching 1
at 1
the 1
doorpost 1
for 1
support 1
when 1
the 1
farmservant 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
he 1
stepped 1
forward 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
joy 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
shot 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
was 1
james 1
vane 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
as 1
he 1
rode 1
home 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
tears 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1

his 1
head 1
no 1
harry 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
too 1
many 1
dreadful 1
things 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
more 1
i 1

my 1
good 1
actions 1
yesterday 1
where 1
were 1
you 1
yesterday 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
harry 1
i 1
was 1
staying 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
inn 1
by 1
myself 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiling 1
anybody 1
can 1
be 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
temptations 1
there 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
are 1
so 1
absolutely 1
uncivilized 1
civilization 1
is 1
not 1
by 1
any 1
means 1
an 1
easy 1
thing 1
to 1
attain 1
to 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
ways 1
by 1
which 1
man 1
can 1
reach 1
it 1
one 1
is 1
by 1
being 1
cultured 1
the 1
other 1
by 1
being 1
corrupt 1
country 1
people 1
have 1
no 1
opportunity 1
of 1
being 1
either 1
so 1
they 1
stagnate 1
culture 1
and 1
corruption 1
echoed 1
dorian 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
something 1
of 1
both 1
it 1
seems 1
terrible 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
found 1
together 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
ideal 1
harry 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
alter 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
altered 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
your 1
good 1
action 1
was 1
or 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
you 1
had 1
done 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
asked 1
his 1
companion 1
as 1
he 1
spilled 1
into 1
his 1
plate 1
a 1
little 1
crimson 1
pyramid 1
of 1
seeded 1
strawberries 1
and 1
through 1
a 1
perforated 1
shellshaped 1
spoon 1
snowed 1
white 1
sugar 1
upon 1
them 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
harry 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
story 1
i 1
could 1
tell 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
i 1
spared 1
somebody 1
it 1
sounds 1
vain 1
but 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
i 1
mean 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
and 1
wonderfully 1
like 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
which 1
first 1
attracted 1
me 1
to 1
her 1
you 1
remember 1
sibyl 1
dont 1
you 1
how 1
long 1
ago 1
that 1
seems 1
well 1
hetty 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
class 1
of 1
course 1
she 1
was 1
simply 1
a 1
girl 1
in 1
a 1
village 1
but 1
i 1
really 1
loved 1
her 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
all 1
during 1
this 1
wonderful 1
may 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
having 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
run 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
week 1
yesterday 1
she 1
met 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
orchard 1
the 1
appleblossoms 1
kept 1
tumbling 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
laughing 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
away 1
together 1
this 1
morning 1
at 1
dawn 1
suddenly 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
as 1
flowerlike 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
found 1
her 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
the 1
novelty 1
of 1
the 1
emotion 1
must 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
real 1
pleasure 1
dorian 1
interrupted 1
lord 1
henry 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
finish 1
your 1
idyll 1
for 1
you 1
you 1
gave 1
her 1
good 1
advice 1
and 1
broke 1
her 1
heart 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
your 1
reformation 1
harry 1
you 1
are 1
horrible 1
you 1
mustnt 1
say 1
these 1
dreadful 1
things 1
hettys 1
heart 1
is 1
not 1
broken 1
of 1
course 1
she 1
cried 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
disgrace 1
upon 1
her 1
she 1
can 1
live 1
like 1
perdita 1
in 1
her 1
garden 1
of 1
mint 1
and 1
marigold 1
and 1
weep 1
over 1
a 1
faithless 1
florizel 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
curiously 1
boyish 1
moods 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
this 1
girl 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
really 1
content 1
now 1
with 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
rank 1
i 1
suppose 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
married 1
some 1
day 1
to 1
a 1
rough 1
carter 1
or 1
a 1
grinning 1
ploughman 1
well 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
having 1
met 1
you 1
and 1
loved 1
you 1
will 1
teach 1
her 1
to 1
despise 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
wretched 1
from 1
a 1
moral 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
i 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
much 1
of 1
your 1
great 1
renunciation 1
even 1
as 1
a 1
beginning 1
it 1
is 1
poor 1
besides 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
hetty 1
isnt 1
floating 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
in 1
some 1
starlit 1
millpond 1
with 1
lovely 1
waterlilies 1
round 1
her 1
like 1
ophelia 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
this 1
harry 1
you 1
mock 1
at 1
everything 1
and 1
then 1
suggest 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
tragedies 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
i 1
told 1
you 1

care 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
i 1

right 1
in 1
acting 1
as 1

poor 1
hetty 1
as 1
i 1
rode 1
past 1
the 1
farm 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
saw 1
her 1
white 1
face 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
like 1
a 1
spray 1
of 1
jasmine 1
dont 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
dont 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
first 1
good 1
action 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
years 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
selfsacrifice 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
known 1
is 1
really 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sin 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
tell 1
me 1
something 1
about 1
yourself 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
town 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
for 1
days 1
the 1
people 1
are 1
still 1
discussing 1
poor 1
basils 1
disappearance 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
that 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
said 1
dorian 1
pouring 1
himself 1
out 1
some 1
wine 1
and 1
frowning 1
slightly 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
they 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
six 1
weeks 1
and 1
the 1
british 1
public 1
are 1
really 1
not 1
equal 1
to 1
the 1
mental 1
strain 1
of 1
having 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
topic 1
every 1
three 1
months 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
fortunate 1
lately 1
however 1
they 1
have 1
had 1
my 1
own 1
divorcecase 1
and 1
alan 1
campbells 1
suicide 1
now 1
they 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
mysterious 1
disappearance 1
of 1
an 1
artist 1
scotland 1
yard 1
still 1
insists 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
grey 1
ulster 1
who 1
left 1
for 1
paris 1
by 1
the 1
midnight 1
train 1
on 1
the 1
ninth 1
of 1
november 1
was 1
poor 1
basil 1
and 1
the 1
french 1
police 1
declare 1
that 1
basil 1
never 1
arrived 1
in 1
paris 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
suppose 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
fortnight 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
told 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
seen 1
in 1
san 1
francisco 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
but 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
disappears 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
at 1
san 1
francisco 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
city 1
and 1
possess 1
all 1
the 1
attractions 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
basil 1
asked 1
dorian 1
holding 1
up 1
his 1
burgundy 1
against 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
wondering 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
discuss 1
the 1
matter 1
so 1
calmly 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
idea 1
if 1
basil 1
chooses 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
mine 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
him 1
death 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
ever 1
terrifies 1
me 1
i 1
hate 1
it 1
why 1
said 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
wearily 1
because 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
passing 1
beneath 1
his 1
nostrils 1
the 1
gilt 1
trellis 1
of 1
an 1
open 1
vinaigrette 1
box 1
one 1
can 1
survive 1
everything 1
nowadays 1
except 1
that 1
death 1
and 1
vulgarity 1
are 1
the 1
only 1
two 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
explain 1
away 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
our 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
musicroom 1
dorian 1
you 1
must 1
play 1
chopin 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
whom 1
my 1
wife 1
ran 1
away 1
played 1
chopin 1
exquisitely 1
poor 1
victoria 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
the 1
house 1
is 1
rather 1
lonely 1
without 1
her 1
of 1
course 1
married 1
life 1
is 1
merely 1
a 1
habit 1
a 1
bad 1
habit 1
but 1
then 1
one 1
regrets 1
the 1
loss 1
even 1
of 1
ones 1
worst 1
habits 1
perhaps 1
one 1
regrets 1
them 1
the 1
most 1
they 1
are 1
such 1
an 1
essential 1
part 1
of 1
ones 1
personality 1
dorian 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
passing 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
piano 1
and 1
let 1
his 1
fingers 1
stray 1
across 1
the 1
white 1
and 1
black 1
ivory 1
of 1
the 1
keys 1
after 1
the 1
coffee 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
in 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
looking 1
over 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
said 1
harry 1
did 1
it 1
ever 1
occur 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
basil 1
was 1
murdered 1
lord 1
henry 1
yawned 1
basil 1
was 1
very 1
popular 1
and 1
always 1
wore 1
a 1
waterbury 1
watch 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
murdered 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
clever 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
enemies 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wonderful 1
genius 1
for 1
painting 1
but 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
paint 1
like 1
velasquez 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
as 1
dull 1
as 1
possible 1
basil 1
was 1
really 1
rather 1
dull 1
he 1
only 1
interested 1
me 1
once 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
when 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
years 1
ago 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
adoration 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
the 1
dominant 1
motive 1
of 1
his 1
art 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
basil 1
said 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
sadness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
but 1
dont 1
people 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
murdered 1
oh 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
do 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
probable 1
i 1
know 1
there 1
are 1
dreadful 1
places 1
in 1
paris 1
but 1
basil 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
them 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
curiosity 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
chief 1
defect 1
what 1
would 1
you 1
say 1
harry 1
if 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
murdered 1
basil 1
said 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
he 1
watched 1
him 1
intently 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
i 1
would 1
say 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
posing 1
for 1
a 1
character 1
that 1
doesnt 1
suit 1
you 1
all 1
crime 1
is 1
vulgar 1
just 1
as 1
all 1
vulgarity 1
is 1
crime 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
you 1
dorian 1
to 1
commit 1
a 1
murder 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
if 1
i 1
hurt 1
your 1
vanity 1
by 1
saying 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
crime 1
belongs 1
exclusively 1
to 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
i 1
dont 1
blame 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
smallest 1
degree 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
crime 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
what 1
art 1
is 1
to 1
us 1
simply 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
procuring 1
extraordinary 1
sensations 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
procuring 1
sensations 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
then 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
once 1
committed 1
a 1
murder 1
could 1
possibly 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
crime 1
again 1
dont 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
oh 1
anything 1
becomes 1
a 1
pleasure 1
if 1
one 1
does 1
it 1
too 1
often 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
however 1
that 1
murder 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
mistake 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
do 1
anything 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
talk 1
about 1
after 1
dinner 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
pass 1
from 1
poor 1
basil 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
really 1
romantic 1
end 1
as 1
you 1
suggest 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
seine 1
off 1
an 1
omnibus 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
conductor 1
hushed 1
up 1
the 1
scandal 1
yes 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
was 1
his 1
end 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
lying 1
now 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
under 1
those 1
dullgreen 1
waters 1
with 1
the 1
heavy 1
barges 1
floating 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
long 1
weeds 1
catching 1
in 1
his 1
hair 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
much 1
more 1
good 1
work 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
ten 1
years 1
his 1
painting 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
very 1
much 1
dorian 1
heaved 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
lord 1
henry 1
strolled 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stroke 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
curious 1
java 1
parrot 1
a 1
large 1
greyplumaged 1
bird 1
with 1
pink 1
crest 1
and 1
tail 1
that 1
was 1
balancing 1
itself 1
upon 1
a 1
bamboo 1
perch 1
as 1
his 1
pointed 1
fingers 1
touched 1
it 1
it 1
dropped 1
the 1
white 1
scurf 1
of 1
crinkled 1
lids 1
over 1
black 1
glasslike 1
eyes 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sway 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
yes 1
he 1
continued 1
turning 1
round 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
his 1
painting 1
had 1
quite 1
gone 1
off 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
something 1
it 1
had 1
lost 1
an 1
ideal 1
when 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
great 1
friends 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
separated 1
you 1
i 1
suppose 1
he 1
bored 1
you 1
if 1
so 1
he 1
never 1
forgave 1
you 1
its 1
a 1
habit 1
bores 1
have 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
that 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
he 1
did 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
it 1
since 1
he 1
finished 1
it 1
oh 1
i 1
remember 1
your 1
telling 1
me 1
years 1
ago 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
sent 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
selby 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
got 1
mislaid 1
or 1
stolen 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
never 1
got 1
it 1
back 1
what 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
a 1
masterpiece 1
i 1
remember 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
buy 1
it 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
basils 1
best 1
period 1
since 1
then 1
his 1
work 1
was 1
that 1
curious 1
mixture 1
of 1
bad 1
painting 1
and 1
good 1
intentions 1
that 1
always 1
entitles 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
a 1
representative 1
british 1
artist 1
did 1
you 1
advertise 1
for 1
it 1
you 1
should 1
i 1
forget 1
said 1
dorian 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
did 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
really 1
liked 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
i 1
sat 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
hateful 1
to 1
me 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
talk 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
used 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
those 1
curious 1
lines 1
in 1
some 1
playhamlet 1
i 1
thinkhow 1
do 1
they 1
run 1
like 1
the 1
painting 1
of 1
a 1
sorrow 1
a 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughed 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
treats 1
life 1
artistically 1
his 1
brain 1
is 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
answered 1
sinking 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
dorian 1
gray 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
struck 1
some 1
soft 1
chords 1
on 1
the 1
piano 1
like 1
the 1
painting 1
of 1
a 1
sorrow 1
he 1
repeated 1
a 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
the 1
elder 1
man 1
lay 1
back 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
halfclosed 1
eyes 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
profit 1
a 1
man 1
if 1
he 1
gain 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
losehow 1
does 1
the 1
quotation 1
runhis 1
own 1
soul 1
the 1
music 1
jarred 1
and 1
dorian 1
gray 1
started 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
his 1
friend 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
that 1
harry 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
in 1
surprise 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
because 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
answer 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
park 1
last 1
sunday 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
marble 1
arch 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
little 1
crowd 1
of 1
shabbylooking 1
people 1
listening 1
to 1
some 1
vulgar 1
streetpreacher 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
by 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
man 1
yelling 1
out 1
that 1
question 1
to 1
his 1
audience 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
being 1
rather 1
dramatic 1
london 1
is 1
very 1
rich 1
in 1
curious 1
effects 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
a 1
wet 1
sunday 1
an 1
uncouth 1
christian 1
in 1
a 1
mackintosh 1
a 1
ring 1
of 1
sickly 1
white 1
faces 1
under 1
a 1
broken 1
roof 1
of 1
dripping 1
umbrellas 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
phrase 1
flung 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
by 1
shrill 1
hysterical 1
lipsit 1
was 1
really 1
very 1
good 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
quite 1
a 1
suggestion 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
prophet 1
that 1
art 1
had 1
a 1
soul 1
but 1
that 1
man 1
had 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
however 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
me 1
dont 1
harry 1
the 1
soul 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
reality 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
bought 1
and 1
sold 1
and 1
bartered 1
away 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
poisoned 1
or 1
made 1
perfect 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
soul 1
in 1
each 1
one 1
of 1

i 1
know 1
it 1
do 1
you 1
feel 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
dorian 1
quite 1
sure 1
ah 1
then 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
an 1
illusion 1
the 1
things 1
one 1
feels 1
absolutely 1
certain 1
about 1
are 1
never 1
true 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
fatality 1
of 1
faith 1
and 1
the 1
lesson 1
of 1
romance 1
how 1
grave 1
you 1
are 1
dont 1
be 1
so 1
serious 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
or 1
i 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
superstitions 1
of 1
our 1
age 1
no 1
we 1
have 1
given 1
up 1
our 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
play 1
me 1
something 1
play 1
me 1
a 1
nocturne 1
dorian 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
play 1
tell 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
how 1
you 1
have 1
kept 1
your 1
youth 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
secret 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
ten 1
years 1
older 1
than 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
worn 1
and 1
yellow 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
wonderful 1
dorian 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
looked 1
more 1
charming 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
tonight 1
you 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
first 1
you 1
were 1
rather 1
cheeky 1
very 1
shy 1
and 1
absolutely 1
extraordinary 1
you 1
have 1
changed 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
not 1
in 1
appearance 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
tell 1
me 1
your 1
secret 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
my 1
youth 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
except 1
take 1
exercise 1
get 1
up 1
early 1
or 1
be 1
respectable 1
youth 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
like 1
it 1
its 1
absurd 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
ignorance 1
of 1
youth 1
the 1
only 1
people 1
to 1
whose 1
opinions 1
i 1
listen 1
now 1
with 1
any 1
respect 1
are 1
people 1
much 1
younger 1
than 1
myself 1
they 1
seem 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
life 1
has 1
revealed 1
to 1
them 1
her 1
latest 1
wonder 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
aged 1
i 1
always 1
contradict 1
the 1
aged 1
i 1
do 1
it 1
on 1
principle 1
if 1
you 1
ask 1
them 1
their 1
opinion 1
on 1
something 1
that 1
happened 1
yesterday 1
they 1
solemnly 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
opinions 1
current 1
in 1
1820 1
when 1
people 1
wore 1
high 1
stocks 1
believed 1
in 1
everything 1
and 1
knew 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
how 1
lovely 1
that 1
thing 1
you 1
are 1
playing 1
is 1
i 1
wonder 1
did 1
chopin 1
write 1
it 1
at 1
majorca 1
with 1
the 1
sea 1
weeping 1
round 1
the 1
villa 1
and 1
the 1
salt 1
spray 1
dashing 1
against 1
the 1
panes 1
it 1
is 1
marvellously 1
romantic 1
what 1
a 1
blessing 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
art 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
imitative 1
dont 1
stop 1
i 1
want 1
music 1
tonight 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
young 1
apollo 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
marsyas 1
listening 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
have 1
sorrows 1
dorian 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
that 1
even 1
you 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
of 1
old 1
age 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
old 1
but 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
young 1
i 1
am 1
amazed 1
sometimes 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
sincerity 1
ah 1
dorian 1
how 1
happy 1
you 1
are 1
what 1
an 1
exquisite 1
life 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
you 1
have 1
drunk 1
deeply 1
of 1
everything 1
you 1
have 1
crushed 1
the 1
grapes 1
against 1
your 1
palate 1
nothing 1
has 1
been 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
all 1
been 1
to 1
you 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
music 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
marred 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
still 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
the 1
same 1
harry 1
yes 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
will 1
be 1
dont 1
spoil 1
it 1
by 1
renunciations 1
at 1
present 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
perfect 1
type 1
dont 1
make 1
yourself 1
incomplete 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
flawless 1
now 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
shake 1
your 1
head 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
besides 1
dorian 1
dont 1
deceive 1
yourself 1
life 1
is 1
not 1
governed 1
by 1
will 1
or 1
intention 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
nerves 1
and 1
fibres 1
and 1
slowly 1
builtup 1
cells 1
in 1
which 1
thought 1
hides 1
itself 1
and 1
passion 1
has 1
its 1
dreams 1
you 1
may 1
fancy 1
yourself 1
safe 1
and 1
think 1
yourself 1
strong 1
but 1
a 1
chance 1
tone 1
of 1
colour 1
in 1
a 1
room 1
or 1
a 1
morning 1
sky 1
a 1
particular 1
perfume 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
once 1
loved 1
and 1
that 1
brings 1
subtle 1
memories 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
line 1
from 1
a 1
forgotten 1
poem 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
across 1
again 1
a 1
cadence 1
from 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
music 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
playi 1
tell 1
you 1
dorian 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
things 1
like 1
these 1
that 1
our 1
lives 1
depend 1
browning 1
writes 1
about 1
that 1
somewhere 1
but 1
our 1
own 1
senses 1
will 1
imagine 1
them 1
for 1
us 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
the 1
odour 1
of 1
_lilas 1
blanc_ 1
passes 1
suddenly 1
across 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
live 1
the 1
strangest 1
month 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
over 1
again 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
you 1
dorian 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
cried 1
out 1
against 1
us 1
both 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
always 1
worshipped 1
you 1
it 1
always 1
will 1
worship 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
type 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
age 1
is 1
searching 1
for 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
afraid 1
it 1
has 1
found 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
done 1
anything 1
never 1
carved 1
a 1
statue 1
or 1
painted 1
a 1
picture 1
or 1
produced 1
anything 1
outside 1
of 1
yourself 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
your 1
art 1
you 1
have 1
set 1
yourself 1
to 1
music 1
your 1
days 1
are 1
your 1
sonnets 1
dorian 1
rose 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
piano 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
yes 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
exquisite 1
he 1
murmured 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
life 1
harry 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
these 1
extravagant 1
things 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
did 1
even 1
you 1
would 1
turn 1
from 1
me 1
you 1
laugh 1
dont 1
laugh 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
stopped 1
playing 1
dorian 1
go 1
back 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
nocturne 1
over 1
again 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
great 1
honeycoloured 1
moon 1
that 1
hangs 1
in 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
she 1
is 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
charm 1
her 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
play 1
she 1
will 1
come 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
you 1
wont 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
then 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
charming 1
evening 1
and 1
we 1
must 1
end 1
it 1
charmingly 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
one 1
at 1
whites 1
who 1
wants 1
immensely 1
to 1
know 1
youyoung 1
lord 1
poole 1
bournemouths 1
eldest 1
son 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
copied 1
your 1
neckties 1
and 1
has 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
introduce 1
him 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
is 1
quite 1
delightful 1
and 1
rather 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
hope 1
not 1
said 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sad 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
tonight 1
harry 1
i 1
shant 1

to 1
the 1
club 1
it 1
is 1
nearly 1
eleven 1
and 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
do 1
stay 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
played 1
so 1
well 1
as 1
tonight 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
your 1
touch 1
that 1
was 1
wonderful 1
it 1
had 1
more 1
expression 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
from 1
it 1
before 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
changed 1
already 1
you 1
cannot 1
change 1
to 1
me 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
friends 1
yet 1
you 1
poisoned 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
book 1
once 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
forgive 1
that 1
harry 1
promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
lend 1
that 1
book 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
it 1
does 1
harm 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
beginning 1
to 1
moralize 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
going 1
about 1
like 1
the 1
converted 1
and 1
the 1
revivalist 1
warning 1
people 1
against 1
all 1
the 1
sins 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
grown 1
tired 1
you 1
are 1
much 1
too 1
delightful 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
besides 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
what 1
we 1
are 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
what 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
as 1
for 1
being 1
poisoned 1
by 1
a 1
book 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
art 1
has 1
no 1
influence 1
upon 1
action 1
it 1
annihilates 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
act 1
it 1
is 1
superbly 1
sterile 1
the 1
books 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
immoral 1
are 1
books 1
that 1
show 1
the 1
world 1
its 1
own 1
shame 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
but 1
we 1
wont 1
discuss 1
literature 1
come 1
round 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
ride 1
at 1
eleven 1
we 1
might 1
go 1
together 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
to 1
lunch 1
afterwards 1
with 1
lady 1
branksome 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
charming 1
woman 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
about 1
some 1
tapestries 1
she 1
is 1
thinking 1
of 1
buying 1
mind 1
you 1
come 1
or 1
shall 1
we 1
lunch 1
with 1
our 1
little 1
duchess 1
she 1
says 1
she 1
never 1
sees 1
you 1
now 1
perhaps 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
of 1
gladys 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
her 1
clever 1
tongue 1
gets 1
on 1
ones 1
nerves 1
well 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
eleven 1
must 1
i 1
really 1
come 1
harry 1
certainly 1
the 1
park 1

quite 1
lovely 1
now 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
such 1
lilacs 1
since 1
the 1
year 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
eleven 1
said 1
dorian 1
good 1
night 1
harry 1
as 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
something 1
more 1
to 1
say 1
then 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
chapter 1
20 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
night 1
so 1
warm 1
that 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
coat 1
over 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
put 1
his 1
silk 1
scarf 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
as 1
he 1
strolled 1
home 1
smoking 1
his 1
cigarette 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
evening 1
dress 1
passed 1
him 1
he 1
heard 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
whisper 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
is 1
dorian 1
gray 1
he 1
remembered 1
how 1
pleased 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
pointed 1
out 1
or 1
stared 1
at 1
or 1
talked 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
hearing 1
his 1
own 1
name 1
now 1
half 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
village 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
often 1
lately 1
was 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
told 1
the 1
girl 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
lured 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
believed 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
her 1
once 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wicked 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
answered 1
that 1
wicked 1
people 1
were 1
always 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
very 1
ugly 1
what 1
a 1
laugh 1
she 1
hadjust 1
like 1
a 1
thrush 1
singing 1
and 1
how 1
pretty 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
her 1
cotton 1
dresses 1
and 1
her 1
large 1
hats 1
she 1
knew 1
nothing 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
lost 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
home 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
servant 1
waiting 1
up 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
sent 1
him 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
in 1
the 1
library 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
over 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
it 1
really 1
true 1
that 1
one 1
could 1
never 1
change 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
wild 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
unstained 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
boyhoodhis 1
rosewhite 1
boyhood 1
as 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
once 1
called 1
it 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
tarnished 1
himself 1
filled 1
his 1
mind 1
with 1
corruption 1
and 1
given 1
horror 1
to 1
his 1
fancy 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
an 1
evil 1
influence 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
had 1
experienced 1
a 1
terrible 1
joy 1
in 1
being 1
so 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
lives 1
that 1
had 1
crossed 1
his 1
own 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
fairest 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
full 1
of 1
promise 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
to 1
shame 1
but 1
was 1
it 1
all 1
irretrievable 1
was 1
there 1
no 1
hope 1
for 1
him 1
ah 1
in 1
what 1
a 1
monstrous 1
moment 1
of 1
pride 1
and 1
passion 1
he 1
had 1
prayed 1
that 1
the 1
portrait 1
should 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
days 1
and 1
he 1
keep 1
the 1
unsullied 1
splendour 1
of 1
eternal 1
youth 1
all 1
his 1
failure 1
had 1
been 1
due 1
to 1
that 1
better 1
for 1
him 1
that 1
each 1
sin 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
brought 1
its 1
sure 1
swift 1
penalty 1
along 1
with 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
purification 1
in 1
punishment 1
not 1
forgive 1
us 1
our 1
sins 1
but 1
smite 1
us 1
for 1
our 1
iniquities 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
prayer 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
a 1
most 1
just 1
god 1
the 1
curiously 1
carved 1
mirror 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
now 1
was 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
whitelimbed 1
cupids 1
laughed 1
round 1
it 1
as 1
of 1
old 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
of 1
horror 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
first 1
noted 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
fatal 1
picture 1
and 1
with 1
wild 1
teardimmed 1
eyes 1
looked 1
into 1
its 1
polished 1
shield 1
once 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
terribly 1
loved 1
him 1
had 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
mad 1
letter 1
ending 1
with 1
these 1
idolatrous 1
words 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
changed 1
because 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
of 1
ivory 1
and 1
gold 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
your 1
lips 1
rewrite 1
history 1
the 1
phrases 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
memory 1
and 1
he 1
repeated 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
to 1
himself 1
then 1
he 1
loathed 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
and 1
flinging 1
the 1
mirror 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
crushed 1
it 1
into 1
silver 1
splinters 1
beneath 1
his 1
heel 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
beauty 1
that 1
had 1
ruined 1
him 1
his 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
prayed 1
for 1
but 1
for 1
those 1
two 1
things 1
his 1
life 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
free 1
from 1
stain 1
his 1
beauty 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
a 1
mask 1
his 1
youth 1
but 1
a 1
mockery 1
what 1
was 1
youth 1
at 1
best 1
a 1
green 1
an 1
unripe 1
time 1
a 1
time 1
of 1
shallow 1
moods 1
and 1
sickly 1
thoughts 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
worn 1
its 1
livery 1
youth 1
had 1
spoiled 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
nothing 1
could 1
alter 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
future 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
think 1
james 1
vane 1
was 1
hidden 1
in 1
a 1
nameless 1
grave 1
in 1
selby 1
churchyard 1
alan 1
campbell 1
had 1
shot 1
himself 1
one 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
laboratory 1
but 1
had 1
not 1
revealed 1
the 1
secret 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
excitement 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
disappearance 1
would 1
soon 1
pass 1
away 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
waning 1
he 1
was 1
perfectly 1
safe 1
there 1
nor 1
indeed 1
was 1
it 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
basil 1
hallward 1
that 1
weighed 1
most 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
living 1
death 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
that 1
troubled 1
him 1
basil 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
had 1
marred 1
his 1
life 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
forgive 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
had 1
done 1
everything 1
basil 1
had 1
said 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
were 1
unbearable 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
yet 1
borne 1
with 1
patience 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
simply 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
for 1
alan 1
campbell 1
his 1
suicide 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
act 1
he 1
had 1
chosen 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
new 1
life 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
surely 1
he 1
had 1
begun 1
it 1
already 1
he 1
had 1
spared 1
one 1
innocent 1
thing 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
tempt 1
innocence 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
hetty 1
merton 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
portrait 1
in 1
the 1
locked 1
room 1
had 1
changed 1
surely 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
still 1
so 1
horrible 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
perhaps 1
if 1
his 1
life 1
became 1
pure 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
expel 1
every 1
sign 1
of 1
evil 1
passion 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
perhaps 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
evil 1
had 1
already 1
gone 1
away 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
look 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
crept 1
upstairs 1
as 1
he 1
unbarred 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
smile 1
of 1
joy 1
flitted 1
across 1
his 1
strangely 1
younglooking 1
face 1
and 1
lingered 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
about 1
his 1
lips 1
yes 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
hideous 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
hidden 1
away 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
a 1
terror 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
load 1
had 1
been 1
lifted 1
from 1
him 1
already 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
quietly 1
locking 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
and 1
dragged 1
the 1
purple 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
portrait 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
indignation 1
broke 1
from 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
change 1
save 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
cunning 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
the 1
curved 1
wrinkle 1
of 1
the 1
hypocrite 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
still 1
loathsomemore 1
loathsome 1
if 1
possible 1
than 1
beforeand 1
the 1
scarlet 1
dew 1
that 1
spotted 1
the 1
hand 1
seemed 1
brighter 1
and 1
more 1
like 1
blood 1
newly 1
spilled 1
then 1
he 1
trembled 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
merely 1
vanity 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
do 1
his 1
one 1
good 1
deed 1
or 1
the 1
desire 1
for 1
a 1
new 1
sensation 1
as 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
hinted 1
with 1
his 1
mocking 1
laugh 1
or 1
that 1
passion 1
to 1
act 1
a 1
part 1
that 1
sometimes 1
makes 1
us 1
do 1
things 1
finer 1
than 1
we 1
are 1
ourselves 1
or 1
perhaps 1
all 1
these 1
and 1
why 1
was 1
the 1
red 1
stain 1
larger 1
than 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
crept 1
like 1
a 1
horrible 1
disease 1
over 1
the 1
wrinkled 1
fingers 1
there 1
was 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
painted 1
feet 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
drippedblood 1
even 1
on 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
held 1
the 1
knife 1
confess 1
did 1
it 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
confess 1
to 1
give 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
he 1
laughed 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
monstrous 1
besides 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
confess 1
who 1
would 1
believe 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
anywhere 1
everything 1
belonging 1
to 1
him 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
he 1
himself 1
had 1
burned 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
belowstairs 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
simply 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
mad 1
they 1
would 1
shut 1
him 1
up 1
if 1
he 1
persisted 1
in 1
his 1
story 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
duty 1
to 1
confess 1
to 1
suffer 1
public 1
shame 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
public 1
atonement 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
god 1
who 1
called 1
upon 1
men 1
to 1
tell 1
their 1
sins 1
to 1
earth 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
to 1
heaven 1
nothing 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
would 1
cleanse 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
his 1
own 1
sin 1
his 1
sin 1
he 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
basil 1
hallward 1
seemed 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
hetty 1
merton 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
unjust 1
mirror 1
this 1
mirror 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
vanity 1
curiosity 1
hypocrisy 1
had 1
there 1
been 1
nothing 1
more 1
in 1
his 1
renunciation 1
than 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
something 1
more 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
thought 1
so 1
but 1
who 1
could 1
tell 1
no 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
nothing 1
more 1
through 1
vanity 1
he 1
had 1
spared 1
her 1
in 1
hypocrisy 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
goodness 1
for 1
curiositys 1
sake 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
the 1
denial 1
of 1
self 1
he 1
recognized 1
that 1
now 1
but 1
this 1
murderwas 1
it 1
to 1
dog 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
was 1
he 1
always 1
to 1
be 1
burdened 1
by 1
his 1
past 1
was 1
he 1
really 1
to 1
confess 1
never 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
bit 1
of 1
evidence 1
left 1
against 1
him 1
the 1
picture 1
itselfthat 1
was 1
evidence 1
he 1
would 1
destroy 1
it 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
so 1
long 1
once 1
it 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
pleasure 1
to 1
watch 1
it 1
changing 1
and 1
growing 1
old 1
of 1
late 1
he 1
had 1
felt 1
no 1
such 1
pleasure 1
it 1
had 1
kept 1
him 1
awake 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
filled 1
with 1
terror 1
lest 1
other 1
eyes 1
should 1
look 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
had 1
brought 1
melancholy 1
across 1
his 1
passions 1
its 1
mere 1
memory 1
had 1
marred 1
many 1
moments 1
of 1
joy 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
like 1
conscience 1
to 1
him 1
yes 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
conscience 1
he 1
would 1
destroy 1
it 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
knife 1
that 1
had 1
stabbed 1
basil 1
hallward 1
he 1
had 1
cleaned 1
it 1
many 1
times 1
till 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
stain 1
left 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
glistened 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
killed 1
the 1
painter 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
kill 1
the 1
painters 1
work 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
that 1
meant 1
it 1
would 1
kill 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
when 1
that 1
was 1
dead 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
free 1
it 1
would 1
kill 1
this 1
monstrous 1
soullife 1
and 1
without 1
its 1
hideous 1
warnings 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
he 1
seized 1
the 1
thing 1
and 1
stabbed 1
the 1
picture 1
with 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
cry 1
heard 1
and 1
a 1
crash 1
the 1
cry 1
was 1
so 1
horrible 1
in 1
its 1
agony 1
that 1
the 1
frightened 1
servants 1
woke 1
and 1
crept 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
rooms 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
were 1
passing 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
below 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
they 1
walked 1
on 1
till 1
they 1
met 1
a 1
policeman 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
the 1
man 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
several 1
times 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1

for 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
windows 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
all 1
dark 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
an 1
adjoining 1
portico 1
and 1
watched 1
whose 1
house 1
is 1
