ah 1
heavens 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
i 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
another 1
door 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
people 1
heard 1
the 1
jingling 1
of 1
the 1
bells 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
open 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
in 1
nowhere 1
then 1
she 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
the 1
miser 1
in 1
the 1
bush 1
a 1
farmer 1
had 1
a 1
faithful 1
and 1
diligent 1
servant 1
who 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
him 1
three 1
years 1
without 1
having 1
been 1
paid 1
any 1
wages 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
mans 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
on 1
thus 1
without 1
pay 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
you 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
will 1
trust 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
deserve 1
to 1
have 1
for 1
my 1
trouble 1
the 1
farmer 1
was 1
a 1
sad 1
miser 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
man 1
was 1
very 1
simplehearted 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
threepence 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
for 1
every 1
years 1
service 1
a 1
penny 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
have 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
work 1
hard 1
and 1
live 1
here 1
on 1
bad 1
fare 1
any 1
longer 1
i 1
can 1
now 1
travel 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
merry 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
money 1
into 1
his 1
purse 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
roaming 1
over 1
hill 1
and 1
valley 1
as 1
he 1
jogged 1
along 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
singing 1
and 1
dancing 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
made 1
him 1
so 1
merry 1
why 1
what 1
should 1
make 1
me 1
downhearted 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
sound 1
in 1
health 1
and 1
rich 1
in 1
purse 1
what 1
should 1
i 1
care 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
saved 1
up 1
my 1
three 1
years 1
earnings 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
all 1
safe 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
how 1
much 1
may 1
it 1
come 1
to 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
full 1
threepence 1
replied 1
the 1
countryman 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
poor 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
pitied 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
said 1
in 1
return 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
kind 1
honest 1
heart 1
i 1
will 1
grant 1
you 1
three 1
wishesone 1
for 1
every 1
penny 1
so 1
choose 1
whatever 1
you 1
like 1
then 1
the 1
countryman 1
rejoiced 1
at 1
his 1
good 1
luck 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
like 1
many 1
things 1
better 1
than 1
money 1
first 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
bow 1
that 1
will 1
bring 1
down 1
everything 1
i 1
shoot 1
at 1
secondly 1
a 1
fiddle 1
that 1
will 1
set 1
everyone 1
dancing 1
that 1
hears 1
me 1
play 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
thirdly 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
everyone 1
should 1
grant 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
three 1
wishes 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
fiddle 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
our 1
honest 1
friend 1
journeyed 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
too 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
merry 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
ten 1
times 1
more 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
he 1
met 1
an 1
old 1
miser 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
stood 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
topmost 1
twig 1
sat 1
a 1
thrush 1
singing 1
away 1
most 1
joyfully 1
oh 1
what 1
a 1
pretty 1
bird 1
said 1
the 1
miser 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
if 1
thats 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
countryman 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
bring 1
it 1
down 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
down 1
fell 1
the 1
thrush 1
into 1
the 1
bushes 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
the 1
miser 1
crept 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
but 1
directly 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
his 1
companion 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
played 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
dance 1
and 1
spring 1
about 1
capering 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
thorns 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
tear 1
his 1
clothes 1
till 1
they 1
all 1
hung 1
in 1
rags 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
himself 1
was 1
all 1
scratched 1
and 1
wounded 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
down 1
oh 1
for 1
heavens 1
sake 1
cried 1
the 1
miser 1
master 1
master 1
pray 1
let 1
the 1
fiddle 1
alone 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
done 1
to 1
deserve 1
this 1
thou 1
hast 1
shaved 1
many 1
a 1
poor 1
soul 1
close 1
enough 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
thou 1
art 1
only 1
meeting 1
thy 1
reward 1
so 1
he 1
played 1
up 1
another 1
tune 1
then 1
the 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
beg 1
and 1
promise 1
and 1
offered 1
money 1
for 1
his 1
liberty 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
musicians 1
price 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
he 1
danced 1
him 1
along 1
brisker 1
and 1
brisker 1
and 1
the 1
miser 1
bid 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
offered 1
a 1
round 1
hundred 1
of 1
florins 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
purse 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
gained 1
by 1
cheating 1
some 1
poor 1
fellow 1
when 1
the 1
countryman 1
saw 1
so 1
much 1
money 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
agree 1
to 1
your 1
proposal 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
purse 1
put 1
up 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
travelled 1
on 1
very 1
pleased 1
with 1
his 1
bargain 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
miser 1
crept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bush 1
halfnaked 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
piteous 1
plight 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
ponder 1
how 1
he 1
should 1
take 1
his 1
revenge 1
and 1
serve 1
his 1
late 1
companion 1
some 1
trick 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
complained 1
that 1
a 1
rascal 1
had 1
robbed 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
and 1
beaten 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
who 1
did 1
it 1
carried 1
a 1
bow 1
at 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
a 1
fiddle 1
hung 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
then 1
the 1
judge 1
sent 1
out 1
his 1
officers 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
the 1
accused 1
wherever 1
they 1
should 1
find 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
caught 1
and 1
brought 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
tried 1
the 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
robbed 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
no 1
you 1
gave 1
it 1
me 1
for 1
playing 1
a 1
tune 1
to 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
countryman 1
but 1
the 1
judge 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
likely 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
matter 1
short 1
by 1
ordering 1
him 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
so 1
away 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
he 1
said 1
my 1
lord 1
judge 1
grant 1
me 1
one 1
last 1
request 1
anything 1
but 1
thy 1
life 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
no 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
ask 1
my 1
life 1
only 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
play 1
upon 1
my 1
fiddle 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
the 1
miser 1
cried 1
out 1
oh 1
no 1
no 1
for 1
heavens 1
sake 1
dont 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
dont 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
this 1
once 1
he 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
fact 1
was 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
the 1
request 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
third 1
gift 1
then 1
the 1
miser 1
said 1
bind 1
me 1
fast 1
bind 1
me 1
fast 1
for 1
pitys 1
sake 1
but 1
the 1
countryman 1
seized 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
struck 1
up 1
a 1
tune 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
note 1
judge 1
clerks 1
and 1
jailer 1
were 1
in 1
motion 1
all 1
began 1
capering 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
hold 1
the 1
miser 1
at 1
the 1
second 1
note 1
the 1
hangman 1
let 1
his 1
prisoner 1
go 1
and 1
danced 1
also 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
had 1
played 1
the 1
first 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
tune 1
all 1
were 1
dancing 1
togetherjudge 1
court 1
and 1
miser 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
followed 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
merry 1
and 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
playing 1
or 1
dancing 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
and 1
beg 1
him 1
to 1
leave 1
off 1
but 1
he 1
stopped 1
not 1
a 1
whit 1
the 1
more 1
for 1
their 1
entreaties 1
till 1
the 1
judge 1
not 1
only 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
promised 1
to 1
return 1
him 1
the 1
hundred 1
florins 1
then 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
miser 1
and 1
said 1
tell 1
us 1
now 1
you 1
vagabond 1
where 1
you 1
got 1
that 1
gold 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
play 1
on 1
for 1
your 1
amusement 1
only 1
i 1
stole 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
miser 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
i 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
i 1
stole 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
earned 1
it 1
fairly 1
then 1
the 1
countryman 1
stopped 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
miser 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
place 1
at 1
the 1
gallows 1
ashputtel 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
fell 1
sick 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
her 1
end 1
drew 1
nigh 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
only 1
daughter 1
to 1
her 1
bedside 1
and 1
said 1
always 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
girl 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
look 1
down 1
from 1
heaven 1
and 1
watch 1
over 1
you 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
she 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
and 1
was 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
went 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
her 1
grave 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
was 1
always 1
good 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
all 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
fell 1
and 1
spread 1
a 1
beautiful 1
white 1
covering 1
over 1
the 1
grave 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
spring 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
melted 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
her 1
father 1
had 1
married 1
another 1
wife 1
this 1
new 1
wife 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
that 1
she 1
brought 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
they 1
were 1
fair 1
in 1
face 1
but 1
foul 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
a 1
sorry 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
girl 1
what 1
does 1
the 1
goodfornothing 1
want 1
in 1
the 1
parlour 1
said 1
they 1
they 1
who 1
would 1
eat 1
bread 1
should 1
first 1
earn 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
kitchenmaid 1
then 1
they 1
took 1
away 1
her 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
an 1
old 1
grey 1
frock 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
turned 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
there 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
hard 1
work 1
to 1
rise 1
early 1
before 1
daylight 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
cook 1
and 1
to 1
wash 1
besides 1
that 1
the 1
sisters 1
plagued 1
her 1
in 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
ways 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
bed 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
on 1
but 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
lie 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
as 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
her 1
always 1
dusty 1
and 1
dirty 1
they 1
called 1
her 1
ashputtel 1
it 1
happened 1
once 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
fair 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
wifes 1
daughters 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
them 1
fine 1
clothes 1
said 1
the 1
first 1
pearls 1
and 1
diamonds 1
cried 1
the 1
second 1
now 1
child 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
daughter 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
first 1
twig 1
dear 1
father 1
that 1
brushes 1
against 1
your 1
hat 1
when 1
you 1
turn 1
your 1
face 1
to 1
come 1
homewards 1
said 1
she 1
then 1
he 1
bought 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
the 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
pearls 1
and 1
diamonds 1
they 1
had 1
asked 1
for 1
and 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
home 1
as 1
he 1
rode 1
through 1
a 1
green 1
copse 1
a 1
hazel 1
twig 1
brushed 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
almost 1
pushed 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
so 1
he 1
broke 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
home 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
daughter 1
then 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
mothers 1
grave 1
and 1
planted 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
cried 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
watered 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
grew 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
fine 1
tree 1
three 1
times 1
every 1
day 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
soon 1
a 1
little 1
bird 1
came 1
and 1
built 1
its 1
nest 1
upon 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
watched 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
whatever 1
she 1
wished 1
for 1
now 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
that 1
land 1
held 1
a 1
feast 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
last 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
it 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
to 1
choose 1
a 1
bride 1
for 1
himself 1
ashputtels 1
two 1
sisters 1
were 1
asked 1
to 1
come 1
so 1
they 1
called 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
said 1

then 1
she 1
did 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
told 1
but 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
done 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
crying 1
for 1

thought 1
to 1
herself 1
she 1
should 1
so 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
with 1
them 1
to 1

she 1
begged 1

and 1
when 1
she 1
kept 1
on 1
begging 1

said 1

last 1
to 1

she 1
threw 1
the 1
peas 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
maiden 1
ran 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
cried 1

next 1
came 1
two 1
turtledoves 1
and 1
after 1
them 1
came 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
under 1
heaven 1
chirping 1
and 1
fluttering 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
flew 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
doves 1
stooped 1
their 1
heads 1
down 1
and 1
set 1
to 1

then 1
the 1
others 1
began 1
to 1

among 1
them 1
all 1
they 1
soon 1
picked 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
grain 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
dish 1
but 1
left 1
the 1
ashes 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
quite 1
done 1
and 1
all 1
flew 1
out 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
windows 1
then 1
ashputtel 1
brought 1
the 1
dish 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
overjoyed 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
now 1
she 1
should 1

the 1

said 1

when 1
ashputtel 1
begged 1
very 1
hard 1

and 1
thus 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
should 1
at 1
least 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
so 1
she 1
shook 1
two 1
dishes 1
of 1
peas 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
maiden 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1

came 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
under 1
heaven 1
chirping 1
and 1
hopping 1
about 1
and 1
they 1
flew 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
doves 1
put 1
their 1
heads 1
down 1
and 1
set 1

then 1
the 1

again 1
and 1
then 1
ashputtel 1
took 1
the 1
dishes 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
rejoicing 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
now 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
but 1
her 1
mother 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
you 1
cannot 1
go 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
clothes 1
and 1
cannot 1
dance 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
only 1
put 1
us 1
to 1
shame 1
and 1
off 1
she 1
went 1
with 1
her 1
two 1
daughters 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
now 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
gone 1
and 1
nobody 1
left 1
at 1
home 1
ashputtel 1
went 1
sorrowfully 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
under 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
shake 1
shake 1
hazeltree 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
then 1
her 1
friend 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
dress 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
slippers 1
of 1
spangled 1
silk 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
and 1
followed 1
her 1
sisters 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
strange 1
princess 1
she 1
looked 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
beautiful 1
in 1
her 1
rich 1
clothes 1
and 1
they 1
never 1
once 1
thought 1
of 1
ashputtel 1
taking 1
it 1
for 1
granted 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
safe 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
soon 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
left 1
her 1
hand 1
but 1
when 1
anyone 1
else 1
came 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
lady 1
is 1
dancing 1
with 1
me 1
thus 1
they 1
danced 1
till 1
a 1
late 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
said 1
i 1
shall 1
go 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
for 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
where 1
the 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
lived 1
but 1
she 1
slipped 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
unawares 1
and 1
ran 1
off 1
towards 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
prince 1
followed 1
her 1
she 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
pigeonhouse 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
he 1
waited 1
till 1
her 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
unknown 1
maiden 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
had 1
hid 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
pigeonhouse 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
broken 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
they 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
within 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
ashputtel 1
was 1
lying 1
as 1
she 1
always 1
did 1
in 1
her 1
dirty 1
frock 1
by 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
her 1
dim 1
little 1
lamp 1
was 1
burning 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
through 1
the 1
pigeonhouse 1
and 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
and 1
had 1
there 1
taken 1
off 1
her 1
beautiful 1
clothes 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
beneath 1
the 1
tree 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
might 1
carry 1
them 1
away 1
and 1
had 1
lain 1
down 1
again 1
amid 1
the 1
ashes 1
in 1
her 1
little 1
grey 1
frock 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
again 1
held 1
and 1
her 1
father 1
mother 1
and 1
sisters 1
were 1
gone 1
ashputtel 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
and 1
said 1
shake 1
shake 1
hazeltree 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
still 1
finer 1
dress 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
she 1
had 1
worn 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
in 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
everyone 1
wondered 1
at 1
her 1
beauty 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
who 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
her 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
anyone 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
as 1
before 1
this 1
lady 1
is 1
dancing 1
with 1
me 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
followed 1
here 1
as 1
before 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
see 1
into 1
what 1
house 1
she 1
went 1
but 1
she 1
sprang 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
her 1
fathers 1
house 1
in 1
this 1
garden 1
stood 1
a 1
fine 1
large 1
peartree 1
full 1
of 1
ripe 1
fruit 1
and 1
ashputtel 1
not 1
knowing 1
where 1
to 1
hide 1
herself 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
it 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
then 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
waited 1
till 1
her 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
unknown 1
lady 1
who 1
danced 1
with 1
me 1
has 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
sprung 1
into 1
the 1
peartree 1
the 1
father 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
ashputtel 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
axe 1
brought 1
and 1
they 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
there 1
lay 1
ashputtel 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
slipped 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
beautiful 1
clothes 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bird 1
at 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
little 1
grey 1
frock 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
when 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
and 1
sisters 1
were 1
gone 1
she 1
went 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
said 1
shake 1
shake 1
hazeltree 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
then 1
her 1
kind 1
friend 1
the 1
bird 1
brought 1
a 1
dress 1
still 1
finer 1
than 1
the 1
former 1
one 1
and 1
slippers 1
which 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
gold 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
wonder 1
at 1
her 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
danced 1
with 1
nobody 1
but 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
anyone 1
else 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
lady 1
is 1
_my_ 1
partner 1
sir 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
would 1
go 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
lose 1
her 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
however 1
she 1
again 1
slipped 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
though 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
that 1
she 1
dropped 1
her 1
left 1
golden 1
slipper 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
prince 1
took 1
the 1
shoe 1
and 1
went 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
for 1
my 1
wife 1
the 1
lady 1
that 1
this 1
golden 1
slipper 1
fits 1
then 1
both 1
the 1
sisters 1
were 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
beautiful 1
feet 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
wear 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
the 1
eldest 1
went 1
first 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
slipper 1
was 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
stood 1
by 1
but 1
her 1
great 1
toe 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
shoe 1
was 1
altogether 1
much 1
too 1
small 1
for 1
her 1
then 1
the 1
mother 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
said 1
never 1
mind 1
cut 1
it 1
off 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
queen 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
care 1
about 1
toes 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
walk 1
so 1
the 1
silly 1
girl 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
great 1
toe 1
and 1
thus 1
squeezed 1
on 1
the 1
shoe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
homewards 1
but 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
by 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
that 1
ashputtel 1
had 1
planted 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
branch 1
sat 1
a 1
little 1
dove 1
singing 1
back 1
again 1
back 1
again 1
look 1
to 1
the 1
shoe 1
the 1
shoe 1
is 1
too 1
small 1
and 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
prince 1
prince 1
look 1
again 1
for 1
thy 1
bride 1
for 1
shes 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
foot 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
blood 1
that 1
streamed 1
from 1
it 1
what 1
a 1
trick 1
she 1
had 1
played 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
home 1
and 1
said 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
bride 1
let 1
the 1
other 1
sister 1
try 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
slipper 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
got 1
her 1
foot 1
into 1
the 1
shoe 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
heel 1
which 1
was 1
too 1
large 1
but 1
her 1
mother 1
squeezed 1
it 1
in 1
till 1
the 1
blood 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
and 1
he 1
set 1
her 1
as 1
his 1
bride 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
the 1
little 1
dove 1
sat 1
there 1
still 1
and 1
sang 1
back 1
again 1
back 1
again 1
look 1
to 1
the 1
shoe 1
the 1
shoe 1
is 1
too 1
small 1
and 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
prince 1
prince 1
look 1
again 1
for 1
thy 1
bride 1
for 1
shes 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
streamed 1
so 1
much 1
from 1
the 1
shoe 1
that 1
her 1
white 1
stockings 1
were 1
quite 1
red 1
so 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
also 1
back 1
again 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
father 1

you 1
no 1
other 1
daughters 1

he 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
dirty 1
ashputtel 1
here 1
the 1
child 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
wife 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
she 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
bride 1
the 1
prince 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
but 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
no 1
no 1
she 1
is 1
much 1
too 1
dirty 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
show 1
herself 1
however 1
the 1
prince 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
come 1
and 1
she 1
first 1
washed 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
curtsied 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
reached 1
her 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
then 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
clumsy 1
shoe 1
off 1
her 1
left 1
foot 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
and 1
it 1
fitted 1
her 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
face 1
he 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
bride 1
but 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
both 1
the 1
sisters 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
turned 1
pale 1
with 1
anger 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
ashputtel 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
hazeltree 1
the 1
white 1
dove 1
sang 1
home 1
home 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
shoe 1
princess 1
the 1
shoe 1
was 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
prince 1
prince 1
take 1
home 1
thy 1
bride 1
for 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
dove 1
had 1
done 1
its 1
song 1
it 1
came 1
flying 1
and 1
perched 1
upon 1
her 1
right 1
shoulder 1
and 1
so 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
the 1
white 1
snake 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
there 1
lived 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
famed 1
for 1
his 1
wisdom 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
nothing 1
was 1
hidden 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
secret 1
things 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
custom 1
every 1
day 1
after 1
dinner 1
when 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
cleared 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
present 1
a 1
trusty 1
servant 1
had 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
one 1
more 1
dish 1
it 1
was 1
covered 1
however 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
servant 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
it 1
neither 1
did 1
anyone 1
know 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
never 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
cover 1
to 1
eat 1
of 1
it 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
alone 1
this 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
when 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
took 1
away 1
the 1
dish 1
was 1
overcome 1
with 1
such 1
curiosity 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
carrying 1
the 1
dish 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
carefully 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
the 1
cover 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
white 1
snake 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
dish 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
deny 1
himself 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
tasting 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
cut 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
mouth 1
no 1
sooner 1
had 1
it 1
touched 1
his 1
tongue 1
than 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
strange 1
whispering 1
of 1
little 1
voices 1
outside 1
his 1
window 1
he 1
went 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
then 1
noticed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
sparrows 1
who 1
were 1
chattering 1
together 1
and 1
telling 1
one 1
another 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
and 1
woods 1
eating 1
the 1
snake 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
power 1
of 1
understanding 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
animals 1
now 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
on 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
the 1
queen 1
lost 1
her 1
most 1
beautiful 1
ring 1
and 1
suspicion 1
of 1
having 1
stolen 1
it 1
fell 1
upon 1
this 1
trusty 1
servant 1
who 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
go 1
everywhere 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
threatened 1
with 1
angry 1
words 1
that 1
unless 1
he 1
could 1
before 1
the 1
morrow 1
point 1
out 1
the 1
thief 1
he 1
himself 1
should 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
guilty 1
and 1
executed 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
declared 1
his 1
innocence 1
he 1
was 1
dismissed 1
with 1
no 1
better 1
answer 1
in 1
his 1
trouble 1
and 1
fear 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
took 1
thought 1
how 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
now 1
some 1
ducks 1
were 1
sitting 1
together 1
quietly 1
by 1
a 1
brook 1
and 1
taking 1
their 1
rest 1
and 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
their 1
feathers 1
smooth 1
with 1
their 1
bills 1
they 1
were 1
having 1
a 1
confidential 1
conversation 1
together 1
the 1
servant 1
stood 1
by 1
and 1
listened 1
they 1
were 1
telling 1
one 1
another 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
places 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
waddling 1
about 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
what 1
good 1
food 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
and 1
one 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
pitiful 1
tone 1
something 1
lies 1
heavy 1
on 1
my 1
stomach 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
eating 1
in 1
haste 1
i 1
swallowed 1
a 1
ring 1
which 1
lay 1
under 1
the 1
queens 1
window 1
the 1
servant 1
at 1
once 1
seized 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
neck 1
carried 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
cook 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
fine 1
duck 1
pray 1
kill 1
her 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
cook 1
and 1
weighed 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
she 1
has 1
spared 1
no 1
trouble 1
to 1
fatten 1
herself 1
and 1
has 1
been 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
roasted 1
long 1
enough 1
so 1
he 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
being 1
dressed 1
for 1
the 1
spit 1
the 1
queens 1
ring 1
was 1
found 1
inside 1
her 1
the 1
servant 1
could 1
now 1
easily 1
prove 1
his 1
innocence 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
make 1
amends 1
for 1
the 1
wrong 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
ask 1
a 1
favour 1
and 1
promised 1
him 1
the 1
best 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wish 1
for 1
the 1
servant 1
refused 1
everything 1
and 1
only 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
horse 1
and 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
travelling 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
go 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
when 1
his 1
request 1
was 1
granted 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
pond 1
where 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
fishes 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
reeds 1
and 1
gasping 1
for 1
water 1
now 1
though 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
fishes 1
are 1
dumb 1
he 1
heard 1
them 1
lamenting 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
perish 1
so 1
miserably 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
kind 1
heart 1
he 1
got 1
off 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
three 1
prisoners 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
they 1
leapt 1
with 1
delight 1
put 1
out 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
cried 1
to 1
him 1
we 1
will 1
remember 1
you 1
and 1
repay 1
you 1
for 1
saving 1
us 1
he 1
rode 1
on 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
voice 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
listened 1
and 1
heard 1
an 1
antking 1
complain 1
why 1
cannot 1
folks 1
with 1
their 1
clumsy 1
beasts 1
keep 1
off 1
our 1
bodies 1
that 1
stupid 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
heavy 1
hoofs 1
has 1
been 1
treading 1
down 1
my 1
people 1
without 1
mercy 1
so 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
side 1
path 1
and 1
the 1
antking 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
we 1
will 1
remember 1
youone 1
good 1
turn 1
deserves 1
another 1
the 1
path 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
old 1
ravens 1
standing 1
by 1
their 1
nest 1
and 1
throwing 1
out 1
their 1
young 1
ones 1
out 1
with 1
you 1
you 1
idle 1
goodfornothing 1
creatures 1
cried 1
they 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
food 1
for 1
you 1
any 1
longer 1
you 1
are 1
big 1
enough 1
and 1
can 1
provide 1
for 1
yourselves 1
but 1
the 1
poor 1
young 1
ravens 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
flapping 1
their 1
wings 1
and 1
crying 1
oh 1
what 1
helpless 1
chicks 1
we 1
are 1
we 1
must 1
shift 1
for 1
ourselves 1
and 1
yet 1
we 1
cannot 1
fly 1
what 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
but 1
lie 1
here 1
and 1
starve 1
so 1
the 1
good 1
young 1
fellow 1
alighted 1
and 1
killed 1
his 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
them 1
for 1
food 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
hopping 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
satisfied 1
their 1
hunger 1
and 1
cried 1
we 1
will 1
remember 1
youone 1
good 1
turn 1
deserves 1
another 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
own 1
legs 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
city 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
and 1
crowd 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
rode 1
up 1
on 1
horseback 1
crying 1
aloud 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
wants 1
a 1
husband 1
but 1
whoever 1
seeks 1
her 1
hand 1
must 1
perform 1
a 1
hard 1
task 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
succeed 1
he 1
will 1
forfeit 1
his 1
life 1
many 1
had 1
already 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
nevertheless 1
when 1
the 1
youth 1
saw 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
by 1
her 1
great 1
beauty 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
all 1
danger 1
went 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
declared 1
himself 1
a 1
suitor 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
was 1
thrown 1
into 1
it 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
fetch 1
this 1
ring 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
added 1
if 1
you 1
come 1
up 1
again 1
without 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
thrown 1
in 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
until 1
you 1
perish 1
amid 1
the 1
waves 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
grieved 1
for 1
the 1
handsome 1
youth 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
leaving 1
him 1
alone 1
by 1
the 1
sea 1
he 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
considered 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
when 1
suddenly 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
fishes 1
come 1
swimming 1
towards 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
very 1
fishes 1
whose 1
lives 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
held 1
a 1
mussel 1
in 1
its 1
mouth 1
which 1
it 1
laid 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
at 1
the 1
youths 1
feet 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
gold 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
shell 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
expected 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
grant 1
him 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
proud 1
princess 1
perceived 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
equal 1
in 1
birth 1
she 1
scorned 1
him 1
and 1
required 1
him 1
first 1
to 1
perform 1
another 1
task 1
she 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
strewed 1
with 1
her 1
own 1
hands 1
ten 1
sacksful 1
of 1
milletseed 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
before 1
sunrise 1
these 1
must 1
be 1
picked 1
up 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
grain 1
be 1
wanting 1
the 1
youth 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
considered 1
how 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
possible 1
to 1
perform 1
this 1
task 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
sorrowfully 1
awaiting 1
the 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
death 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
he 1
saw 1
all 1
the 1
ten 1
sacks 1
standing 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
quite 1
full 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
grain 1
was 1
missing 1
the 1
antking 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
of 1
ants 1
and 1
the 1
grateful 1
creatures 1
had 1
by 1
great 1
industry 1
picked 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
milletseed 1
and 1
gathered 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sacks 1
presently 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
herself 1
came 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
was 1
amazed 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
task 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
yet 1
conquer 1
her 1
proud 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
although 1
he 1
has 1
performed 1
both 1
the 1
tasks 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
my 1
husband 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
youth 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
tree 1
of 1
life 1
stood 1
but 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
on 1
for 1
ever 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
his 1
legs 1
would 1
carry 1
him 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
it 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
wandered 1
through 1
three 1
kingdoms 1
he 1
came 1
one 1
evening 1
to 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
sleep 1
but 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
rustling 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
fell 1
into 1
his 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
three 1
ravens 1
flew 1
down 1
to 1
him 1
perched 1
themselves 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
are 1
the 1
three 1
young 1
ravens 1
whom 1
you 1
saved 1
from 1
starving 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
grown 1
big 1
and 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
seeking 1
the 1
golden 1
apple 1
we 1
flew 1
over 1
the 1
sea 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
where 1
the 1
tree 1
of 1
life 1
stands 1
and 1
have 1
brought 1
you 1
the 1
apple 1
the 1
youth 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
set 1
out 1
homewards 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
golden 1
apple 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
who 1
had 1
now 1
no 1
more 1
excuses 1
left 1
to 1
make 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
apple 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
together 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
heart 1
became 1
full 1
of 1
love 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
in 1
undisturbed 1
happiness 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
age 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
seven 1
little 1
kids 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
an 1
old 1
goat 1
who 1
had 1
seven 1
little 1
kids 1
and 1
loved 1
them 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
mother 1
for 1
her 1
children 1
one 1
day 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
fetch 1
some 1
food 1
so 1
she 1
called 1
all 1
seven 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
children 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
be 1
on 1
your 1
guard 1
against 1
the 1
wolf 1
if 1
he 1
comes 1
in 1
he 1
will 1
devour 1
you 1
allskin 1
hair 1
and 1
everything 1
the 1
wretch 1
often 1
disguises 1
himself 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
by 1
his 1
rough 1
voice 1
and 1
his 1
black 1
feet 1
the 1
kids 1
said 1
dear 1
mother 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
ourselves 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
away 1
without 1
any 1
anxiety 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
one 1
bleated 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
with 1
an 1
easy 1
mind 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
someone 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
housedoor 1
and 1
called 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
dear 1
children 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
something 1
back 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
kids 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wolf 1
by 1
the 1
rough 1
voice 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
cried 1
they 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
our 1
mother 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
soft 1
pleasant 1
voice 1
but 1
your 1
voice 1
is 1
rough 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
wolf 1
then 1
the 1
wolf 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
shopkeeper 1
and 1
bought 1
himself 1
a 1
great 1
lump 1
of 1
chalk 1
ate 1
this 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
voice 1
soft 1
with 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
called 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
dear 1
children 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
something 1
back 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
laid 1
his 1
black 1
paws 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
saw 1
them 1
and 1
cried 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
our 1
mother 1
has 1
not 1
black 1
feet 1
like 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
wolf 1
then 1
the 1
wolf 1
ran 1
to 1
a 1
baker 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
hurt 1
my 1
feet 1
rub 1
some 1
dough 1
over 1
them 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
baker 1
had 1
rubbed 1
his 1
feet 1
over 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
said 1
strew 1
some 1
white 1
meal 1
over 1
my 1
feet 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
miller 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
the 1
wolf 1
wants 1
to 1
deceive 1
someone 1
and 1
refused 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
devour 1
you 1
then 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
afraid 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
paws 1
white 1
for 1
him 1
truly 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
mankind 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
wretch 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
to 1
the 1
housedoor 1
knocked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
me 1
children 1
your 1
dear 1
little 1
mother 1
has 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
something 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
her 1
the 1
little 1
kids 1
cried 1
first 1
show 1
us 1
your 1
paws 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
know 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
our 1
dear 1
little 1
mother 1
then 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
paws 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
kids 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
white 1
they 1
believed 1
that 1
all 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
who 1
should 1
come 1
in 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
they 1
were 1
terrified 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
hide 1
themselves 1
one 1
sprang 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
second 1
into 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
third 1
into 1
the 1
stove 1
the 1
fourth 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
the 1
fifth 1
into 1
the 1
cupboard 1
the 1
sixth 1
under 1
the 1
washingbowl 1
and 1
the 1
seventh 1
into 1
the 1
clockcase 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
found 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
used 1
no 1
great 1
ceremony 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
swallowed 1
them 1
down 1
his 1
throat 1
the 1
youngest 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
clockcase 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
when 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
satisfied 1
his 1
appetite 1
he 1
took 1
himself 1
off 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
meadow 1
outside 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sleep 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
old 1
goat 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
ah 1
what 1
a 1
sight 1
she 1
saw 1
there 1
the 1
housedoor 1
stood 1
wide 1
open 1
the 1
table 1
chairs 1
and 1
benches 1
were 1
thrown 1
down 1
the 1
washingbowl 1
lay 1
broken 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
the 1
quilts 1
and 1
pillows 1
were 1
pulled 1
off 1
the 1
bed 1
she 1
sought 1
her 1
children 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
nowhere 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
she 1
called 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
by 1
name 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
answered 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
youngest 1
a 1
soft 1
voice 1
cried 1
dear 1
mother 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
the 1
clockcase 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
kid 1
out 1
and 1
it 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
had 1
eaten 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
then 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
how 1
she 1
wept 1
over 1
her 1
poor 1
children 1
at 1
length 1
in 1
her 1
grief 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
kid 1
ran 1
with 1
her 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
wolf 1
by 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
snored 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
the 1
branches 1
shook 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
moving 1
and 1
struggling 1
in 1
his 1
gorged 1
belly 1
ah 1
heavens 1
she 1
said 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
children 1
whom 1
he 1
has 1
swallowed 1
down 1
for 1
his 1
supper 1
can 1
be 1
still 1
alive 1
then 1
the 1
kid 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
home 1
and 1
fetch 1
scissors 1
and 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
the 1
goat 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
monsters 1
stomach 1
and 1
hardly 1
had 1
she 1
made 1
one 1
cut 1
than 1
one 1
little 1
kid 1
thrust 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
farther 1
all 1
six 1
sprang 1
out 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
and 1
were 1
all 1
still 1
alive 1
and 1
had 1
suffered 1
no 1
injury 1
whatever 1
for 1
in 1
his 1
greediness 1
the 1
monster 1
had 1
swallowed 1
them 1
down 1
whole 1
what 1
rejoicing 1
there 1
was 1
they 1
embraced 1
their 1
dear 1
mother 1
and 1
jumped 1
like 1
a 1
tailor 1
at 1
his 1
wedding 1
the 1
mother 1
however 1
said 1
now 1
go 1
and 1
look 1
for 1
some 1
big 1
stones 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
fill 1
the 1
wicked 1
beasts 1
stomach 1
with 1
them 1
while 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
asleep 1
then 1
the 1
seven 1
kids 1
dragged 1
the 1
stones 1
thither 1
with 1
all 1
speed 1
and 1
put 1
as 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
into 1
this 1
stomach 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
sewed 1
him 1
up 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
haste 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
of 1
anything 1
and 1
never 1
once 1
stirred 1
when 1
the 1
wolf 1
at 1
length 1
had 1
had 1
his 1
fill 1
of 1
sleep 1
he 1
got 1
on 1
his 1
legs 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
stones 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
made 1
him 1
very 1
thirsty 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
well 1
to 1
drink 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
and 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
the 1
stones 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
knocked 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
rattled 1
then 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
rumbles 1
and 1
tumbles 1
against 1
my 1
poor 1
bones 1
i 1
thought 1
twas 1
six 1
kids 1
but 1
it 1
feels 1
like 1
big 1
stones 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
stooped 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
the 1
heavy 1
stones 1
made 1
him 1
fall 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
drowned 1
miserably 1
when 1
the 1
seven 1
kids 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
cried 1
aloud 1
the 1
wolf 1
is 1
dead 1
the 1
wolf 1
is 1
dead 1
and 1
danced 1
for 1
joy 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
well 1
with 1
their 1
mother 1
the 1
queen 1
bee 1
two 1
kings 1
sons 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
seek 1
their 1
fortunes 1
but 1
they 1
soon 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
wasteful 1
foolish 1
way 1
of 1
living 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
return 1
home 1
again 1
then 1
their 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
insignificant 1
dwarf 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
his 1
brothers 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
them 1
they 1
only 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
young 1
and 1
simple 1
should 1
try 1
to 1
travel 1
through 1
the 1
world 1
when 1
they 1
who 1
were 1
so 1
much 1
wiser 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
on 1
however 1
they 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
journey 1
together 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
an 1
anthill 1
the 1
two 1
elder 1
brothers 1
would 1
have 1
pulled 1
it 1
down 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
poor 1
ants 1
in 1
their 1
fright 1
would 1
run 1
about 1
and 1
carry 1
off 1
their 1
eggs 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
said 1
let 1
the 1
poor 1
things 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
suffer 1
you 1
to 1
trouble 1
them 1
so 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
lake 1
where 1
many 1
many 1
ducks 1
were 1
swimming 1
about 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
wanted 1
to 1
catch 1
two 1
and 1
roast 1
them 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
let 1
the 1
poor 1
things 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
kill 1
them 1
next 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
beesnest 1
in 1
a 1
hollow 1
tree 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
honey 1
that 1
it 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
trunk 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
wanted 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
kill 1
the 1
bees 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
their 1
honey 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
held 1
them 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
let 1
the 1
pretty 1
insects 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
i 1
cannot 1
let 1
you 1
burn 1
them 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
three 1
brothers 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
castle 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
stables 1
they 1
saw 1
fine 1
horses 1
standing 1
there 1
but 1
all 1
were 1
of 1
marble 1
and 1
no 1
man 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
rooms 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
door 1
on 1
which 1
were 1
three 1
locks 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
a 1
wicket 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
there 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
grey 1
old 1
man 1
sitting 1
at 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
they 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
however 1
they 1
called 1
a 1
third 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
led 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
table 1
covered 1
with 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drunk 1
he 1
showed 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
bedchamber 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
eldest 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
marble 1
table 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
tablets 1
containing 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
means 1
by 1
which 1
the 1
castle 1
might 1
be 1
disenchanted 1
the 1
first 1
tablet 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
under 1
the 1
moss 1
lie 1
the 1
thousand 1
pearls 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
they 1
must 1
all 1
be 1
found 1
and 1
if 1
one 1
be 1
missing 1
by 1
set 1
of 1
sun 1
he 1
who 1
seeks 1
them 1
will 1
be 1
turned 1
into 1
marble 1
the 1
eldest 1
brother 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
sought 1
for 1
the 1
pearls 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
but 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
the 1
first 1
hundred 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
stone 1
as 1
the 1
tablet 1
had 1
foretold 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
second 1
brother 1
undertook 1
the 1
task 1
but 1
he 1
succeeded 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
first 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
find 1
the 1
second 1
hundred 1
of 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
too 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
stone 1
at 1
last 1
came 1
the 1
little 1
dwarfs 1
turn 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
moss 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
so 1
tiresomeso 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
there 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
ants 1
whose 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
came 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
with 1
five 1
thousand 1
ants 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
all 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
laid 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
heap 1
the 1
second 1
tablet 1
said 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
princesss 1
bedchamber 1
must 1
be 1
fished 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
two 1
ducks 1
whose 1
lives 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
swimming 1
about 1
and 1
they 1
dived 1
down 1
and 1
soon 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
key 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
the 1
third 1
task 1
was 1
the 1
hardest 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
choose 1
out 1
the 1
youngest 1
and 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
kings 1
three 1
daughters 1
now 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
beautiful 1
and 1
all 1
exactly 1
alike 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
that 1
the 1
eldest 1
had 1
eaten 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
sugar 1
the 1
next 1
some 1
sweet 1
syrup 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
a 1
spoonful 1
of 1
honey 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
guess 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
honey 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
saved 1
by 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
all 1
three 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
honey 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
dwarf 1
knew 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
youngest 1
thus 1
the 1
spell 1
was 1
broken 1
and 1
all 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
turned 1
into 1
stones 1
awoke 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
proper 1
forms 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
married 1
the 1
youngest 1
and 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
was 1
king 1
after 1
her 1
fathers 1
death 1
but 1
his 1
two 1
brothers 1
married 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
sisters 1
the 1
elves 1
and 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
shoemaker 1
who 1
worked 1
very 1
hard 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
honest 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
earn 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
gone 1
save 1
just 1
leather 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
one 1
pair 1
of 1
shoes 1
then 1
he 1
cut 1
his 1
leather 1
out 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
meaning 1
to 1
rise 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
his 1
conscience 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
light 1
amidst 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
peaceably 1
to 1
bed 1
left 1
all 1
his 1
cares 1
to 1
heaven 1
and 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
his 1
prayers 1
he 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
when 1
to 1
his 1
great 1
wonder 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
shoes 1
all 1
ready 1
made 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
good 1
man 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
think 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
happening 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
workmanship 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
false 1
stitch 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
job 1
all 1
was 1
so 1
neat 1
and 1
true 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
masterpiece 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
a 1
customer 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
shoes 1
suited 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
willingly 1
paid 1
a 1
price 1
higher 1
than 1
usual 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
poor 1
shoemaker 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
bought 1
leather 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
two 1
pairs 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
begin 1
betimes 1
next 1
day 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
saved 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
for 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
done 1
ready 1
to 1
his 1
hand 1
soon 1
in 1
came 1
buyers 1
who 1
paid 1
him 1
handsomely 1
for 1
his 1
goods 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
bought 1
leather 1
enough 1
for 1
four 1
pair 1
more 1
he 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
work 1
again 1
overnight 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
went 1
on 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
what 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
always 1
done 1
by 1
daybreak 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
man 1
soon 1
became 1
thriving 1
and 1
well 1
off 1
again 1
one 1
evening 1
about 1
christmastime 1
as 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
sitting 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
chatting 1
together 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
and 1
watch 1
tonight 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
see 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
comes 1
and 1
does 1
my 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
wife 1
liked 1
the 1
thought 1
so 1
they 1
left 1
a 1
light 1
burning 1
and 1
hid 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
behind 1
a 1
curtain 1
that 1
was 1
hung 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
what 1
would 1
happen 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
there 1
came 1
in 1
two 1
little 1
naked 1
dwarfs 1
and 1
they 1
sat 1
themselves 1
upon 1
the 1
shoemakers 1
bench 1
took 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
was 1
cut 1
out 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
ply 1
with 1
their 1
little 1
fingers 1
stitching 1
and 1
rapping 1
and 1
tapping 1
away 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
rate 1
that 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
was 1
all 1
wonder 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
them 1
and 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
till 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
quite 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
shoes 1
stood 1
ready 1
for 1
use 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
this 1
was 1
long 1
before 1
daybreak 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
bustled 1
away 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
lightning 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
wife 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
these 1
little 1
wights 1
have 1
made 1
us 1
rich 1
and 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
thankful 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
do 1
them 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
run 1
about 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
and 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
very 1
decent 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
nothing 1
upon 1
their 1
backs 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
cold 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
coat 1
and 1
waistcoat 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
pantaloons 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
pair 1
of 1
shoes 1
the 1
thought 1
pleased 1
the 1
good 1
cobbler 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
one 1
evening 1
when 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
were 1
ready 1
they 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
cut 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
and 1
hid 1
themselves 1
to 1
watch 1
what 1
the 1
little 1
elves 1
would 1
do 1
about 1
midnight 1
in 1
they 1
came 1
dancing 1
and 1
skipping 1
hopped 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
clothes 1
lying 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
laughed 1
and 1
chuckled 1
and 1
seemed 1
mightily 1
delighted 1
then 1
they 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
in 1
the 1
twinkling 1
of 1
an 1
eye 1
and 1
danced 1
and 1
capered 1
and 1
sprang 1
about 1
as 1
merry 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
danced 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
green 1
the 1
good 1
couple 1
saw 1
them 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
everything 1
went 1
well 1
with 1
them 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
forward 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
lived 1
the 1
junipertree 1
long 1
long 1
ago 1
some 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
or 1
so 1
there 1
lived 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
and 1
beautiful 1
wife 1
they 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
dearly 1
but 1
sorrowed 1
much 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
children 1
so 1
greatly 1
did 1
they 1
desire 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
that 1
the 1
wife 1
prayed 1
for 1
it 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
but 1
still 1
they 1
remained 1
childless 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
court 1
in 1
which 1
grew 1
a 1
junipertree 1
one 1
winters 1
day 1
the 1
wife 1
stood 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
peel 1
some 1
apples 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
peeling 1
them 1
she 1
cut 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
the 1
blood 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
snow 1
ah 1
sighed 1
the 1
woman 1
heavily 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
child 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
the 1
words 1
her 1
heart 1
grew 1
light 1
within 1
her 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
her 1
wish 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
she 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
feeling 1
glad 1
and 1
comforted 1
a 1
month 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
had 1
all 1
disappeared 1
then 1
another 1
month 1
went 1
by 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
green 1
so 1
the 1
months 1
followed 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
first 1
the 1
trees 1
budded 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
green 1
branches 1
grew 1
thickly 1
intertwined 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
blossoms 1
began 1
to 1
fall 1
once 1
again 1
the 1
wife 1
stood 1
under 1
the 1
junipertree 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
sweet 1
scent 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
leaped 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
with 1
her 1
happiness 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
presently 1
the 1
fruit 1
became 1
round 1
and 1
firm 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
at 1
peace 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
fully 1
ripe 1
she 1
picked 1
the 1
berries 1
and 1
ate 1
eagerly 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
grew 1
sad 1
and 1
ill 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
later 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
weeping 1
if 1
i 1
die 1
bury 1
me 1
under 1
the 1
junipertree 1
then 1
she 1
felt 1
comforted 1
and 1
happy 1
again 1
and 1
before 1
another 1
month 1
had 1
passed 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
her 1
joy 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
her 1
husband 1
buried 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
junipertree 1
and 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
degrees 1
however 1
his 1
sorrow 1
grew 1
less 1
and 1
although 1
at 1
times 1
he 1
still 1
grieved 1
over 1
his 1
loss 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
as 1
usual 1
and 1
later 1
on 1
he 1
married 1
again 1
he 1
now 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
daughter 1
born 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
child 1
of 1
his 1
first 1
wife 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
the 1
mother 1
loved 1
her 1
daughter 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
boy 1
it 1
pierced 1
her 1
heart 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
always 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
continually 1
thinking 1
how 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
property 1
for 1
her 1
this 1
evil 1
thought 1
took 1
possession 1
of 1
her 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
behave 1
very 1
unkindly 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
she 1
drove 1
him 1
from 1
place 1
to 1
place 1
with 1
cuffings 1
and 1
buffetings 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
child 1
went 1
about 1
in 1
fear 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
peace 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
left 1
school 1
to 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
little 1
daughter 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
in 1
the 1
storeroom 1
and 1
said 1
mother 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
yes 1
my 1
child 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
beautiful 1
apple 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chest 1
the 1
chest 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
lid 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
lock 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
daughter 1
again 1
may 1
not 1
brother 1
have 1
one 1
too 1
the 1
mother 1
was 1
angry 1
at 1
this 1
but 1
she 1
answered 1
yes 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
school 1
just 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
saw 1
him 1
coming 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
entered 1
into 1
her 1
for 1
she 1
snatched 1
the 1
apple 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
little 1
daughters 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
one 1
before 1
your 1
brother 1
she 1
threw 1
the 1
apple 1
into 1
the 1
chest 1
and 1
shut 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
boy 1
now 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
evil 1
spirit 1
in 1
the 1
wife 1
made 1
her 1
say 1
kindly 1
to 1
him 1
my 1
son 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
apple 1
but 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
wicked 1
look 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
boy 1
how 1
dreadful 1
you 1
look 1
yes 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
the 1
thought 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
kill 1
him 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
the 1
lid 1
of 1
the 1
chest 1
take 1
one 1
out 1
for 1
yourself 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
the 1
evil 1
spirit 1
urged 1
her 1
and 1
crash 1
down 1
went 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
off 1
went 1
the 1
little 1
boys 1
head 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
with 1
fear 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
if 1
only 1
i 1
can 1
prevent 1
anyone 1
knowing 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
it 1
she 1
thought 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
upstairs 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
top 1
drawer 1
then 1
she 1
set 1
the 1
boys 1
head 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
bound 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
so 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
placed 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
an 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
little 1
marleen 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
stirring 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
boiling 1
water 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
said 1
mother 1
brother 1
is 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
an 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
looks 1
so 1
pale 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
apple 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
and 1
that 1
frightened 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
said 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
answer 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
so 1
little 1
marleen 1
went 1
and 1
said 1
brother 1
give 1
me 1
that 1
apple 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
rolled 1
off 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
at 1
this 1
that 1
she 1
ran 1
crying 1
and 1
screaming 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
oh 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
knocked 1
off 1
brothers 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
nothing 1
would 1
stop 1
her 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
said 1
her 1
mother 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
must 1
know 1
about 1
it 1
so 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
silence 1
what 1
is 1
done 1
cant 1
be 1
undone 1
we 1
will 1
make 1
him 1
into 1
puddings 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
little 1
boy 1
and 1
cut 1
him 1
up 1
made 1
him 1
into 1
puddings 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
pot 1
but 1
marleen 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
her 1
tears 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
pot 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
salt 1
presently 1
the 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
dinner 1
he 1
asked 1
where 1
is 1
my 1
son 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
large 1
dish 1
of 1
black 1
pudding 1
and 1
marleen 1
still 1
wept 1
without 1
ceasing 1
the 1
father 1
again 1
asked 1
where 1
is 1
my 1
son 1
oh 1
answered 1
the 1
wife 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
into 1
the 1
country 1
to 1
his 1
mothers 1
great 1
uncle 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
stay 1
there 1
some 1
time 1
what 1
has 1
he 1
gone 1
there 1
for 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
even 1
said 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
well 1
he 1
likes 1
being 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
away 1
quite 1
six 1
weeks 1
he 1
is 1
well 1
looked 1
after 1
there 1
i 1
feel 1
very 1
unhappy 1
about 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
husband 1
in 1
case 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
said 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
dinner 1
and 1
said 1
little 1
marleen 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
weep 1
brother 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
back 1
then 1
he 1
asked 1
his 1
wife 1
for 1
more 1
pudding 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
ate 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
bones 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
little 1
marleen 1
went 1
upstairs 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
best 1
silk 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
bottom 1
drawer 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
she 1
wrapped 1
all 1
the 1
bones 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
carried 1
them 1
outside 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
did 1
nothing 1
but 1
weep 1
then 1
she 1
laid 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
grass 1
under 1
the 1
junipertree 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
sooner 1
done 1
so 1
then 1
all 1
her 1
sadness 1
seemed 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
wept 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
junipertree 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
the 1
branches 1
waved 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
first 1
away 1
from 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
then 1
together 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
someone 1
clapping 1
their 1
hands 1
for 1
joy 1
after 1
this 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
burning 1
as 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
flew 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
that 1
rose 1
high 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
singing 1
magnificently 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
could 1
no 1
more 1
be 1
seen 1
the 1
junipertree 1
stood 1
there 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
silk 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
the 1
bones 1
were 1
gone 1
little 1
marleen 1
now 1
felt 1
as 1
lighthearted 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
her 1
brother 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
cheerfully 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
ate 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
alighted 1
on 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
goldsmith 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1

mother 1

grieved 1
when 1
i 1
was 1

sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
she 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
underneath 1
the 1
junipertree 1
kywitt 1
kywitt 1
what 1

i 1
the 1
goldsmith 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
workshop 1
making 1
a 1
gold 1
chain 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
song 1
of 1
the 1
bird 1
on 1
his 1
roof 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
he 1
lost 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
slippers 1
but 1
he 1
ran 1
on 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
on 1
one 1
foot 1
and 1
a 1
sock 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
still 1
had 1
on 1
his 1
apron 1
and 1
still 1
held 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
the 1
pincers 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
stood 1
gazing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
while 1
the 1
sun 1
came 1
shining 1
brightly 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
street 1
bird 1
he 1
said 1
how 1
beautifully 1

that 1
song 1

the 1
goldsmith 1
only 1

that 1
again 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
down 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
claw 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
alighted 1
again 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
goldsmith 1

sang 1

in 1
the 1
corner 1

the 1
plate 1
on 1
her 1

wet 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1

bird 1
now 1
flew 1
to 1
the 1
junipertree 1

began 1
singing 1
my 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
the 1
mother 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
her 1
ears 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
see 1
and 1
hear 1
nothing 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
roaring 1
sound 1
in 1
her 1
ears 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
violent 1
storm 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
a 1
burning 1
and 1
flashing 1
like 1
lightning 1
my 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
gone 1

the 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
that 1

singing 1
so 1
magnificently 1
and 1
how 1
warm 1
and 1
bright 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
delicious 1
scent 1
of 1
spice 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
my 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
then 1
little 1
marleen 1
laid 1
her 1
head 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
sobbed 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
outside 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
bird 1
nearer 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
ah 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
cried 1
the 1
wife 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
were 1
in 1
flames 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
she 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
underneath 1
the 1
junipertree 1

kywitt 1
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
am 1
i 1
with 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
let 1
fall 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
just 1
round 1
the 1
mans 1
neck 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
fitted 1
him 1
exactly 1
he 1
went 1
inside 1
and 1
said 1
see 1
what 1
a 1
splendid 1
bird 1
that 1
is 1
he 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
this 1
beautiful 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
looks 1
so 1
beautiful 1
himself 1
but 1
the 1
wife 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
fear 1
and 1
trouble 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
her 1
cap 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
then 1
the 1
bird 1
began 1
again 1
my 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
ah 1
me 1
cried 1
the 1
wife 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
but 1
a 1
thousand 1
feet 1
beneath 1
the 1
earth 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
not 1
hear 1
that 1
song 1
my 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
gone 1
then 1
the 1
woman 1
fell 1
down 1
again 1
as 1
if 1
dead 1
my 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
well 1
said 1
little 1
marleen 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
bird 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
anything 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
she 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
and 1
he 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
shoes 1
to 1
her 1
underneath 1
the 1
junipertree 1
kywitt 1
kywitt 1
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
am 1
i 1
and 1
she 1
now 1
felt 1
quite 1
happy 1
and 1
lighthearted 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
shoes 1
and 1
danced 1
and 1
jumped 1
about 1
in 1
them 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
miserable 1
she 1
said 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
out 1
but 1
that 1
has 1
all 1
passed 1
away 1
that 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
splendid 1
bird 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
red 1
shoes 1
the 1
wife 1
sprang 1
up 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
standing 1
out 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
like 1
flames 1
of 1
fire 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
too 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
will 1
lighten 1
my 1
misery 1
for 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
coming 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
but 1
as 1
she 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
crash 1
the 1
bird 1
threw 1
the 1
millstone 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
crushed 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
little 1
marleen 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
saw 1
mist 1
and 1
flame 1
and 1
fire 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
when 1
these 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
little 1
brother 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
little 1
marleen 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
three 1
rejoiced 1
and 1
went 1
inside 1
together 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
their 1
dinners 1
and 1
ate 1
the 1
turnip 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
brothers 1
who 1
were 1
both 1
soldiers 1
the 1
one 1
was 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
poor 1
the 1
poor 1
man 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
better 1
himself 1
so 1
pulling 1
off 1
his 1
red 1
coat 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
gardener 1
and 1
dug 1
his 1
ground 1
well 1
and 1
sowed 1
turnips 1
when 1
the 1
seed 1
came 1
up 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
plant 1
bigger 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
it 1
kept 1
getting 1
larger 1
and 1
larger 1
and 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
cease 1
growing 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
called 1
the 1
prince 1
of 1
turnips 1
for 1
there 1
never 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
never 1
will 1
again 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
it 1
filled 1
a 1
cart 1
and 1
two 1
oxen 1
could 1
hardly 1
draw 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
gardener 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
nor 1
whether 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
blessing 1
or 1
a 1
curse 1
to 1
him 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
if 1
i 1
sell 1
it 1
it 1
will 1
bring 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
another 1
and 1
for 1
eating 1
the 1
little 1
turnips 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
perhaps 1
is 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
as 1
a 1
mark 1
of 1
respect 1
then 1
he 1
yoked 1
his 1
oxen 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
turnip 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
what 1
a 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
many 1
strange 1
things 1
but 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
as 1
this 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
seed 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
only 1
your 1
good 1
luck 1
if 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
true 1
child 1
of 1
fortune 1
ah 1
no 1
answered 1
the 1
gardener 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
child 1
of 1
fortune 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
soldier 1
who 1
never 1
could 1
get 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
so 1
i 1
laid 1
aside 1
my 1
red 1
coat 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
tilling 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
who 1
is 1
rich 1
and 1
your 1
majesty 1
knows 1
him 1
well 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
knows 1
him 1
but 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
poor 1
everybody 1
forgets 1
me 1
the 1
king 1
then 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
poor 1
no 1
longer 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
even 1
richer 1
than 1
your 1
brother 1
then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
gold 1
and 1
lands 1
and 1
flocks 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
so 1
rich 1
that 1
his 1
brothers 1
fortune 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
be 1
compared 1
with 1
his 1
when 1
the 1
brother 1
heard 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
turnip 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
gardener 1
so 1
rich 1
he 1
envied 1
him 1
sorely 1
and 1
bethought 1
himself 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
contrive 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
fortune 1
for 1
himself 1
however 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
manage 1
more 1
cleverly 1
than 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
got 1
together 1
a 1
rich 1
present 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
fine 1
horses 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
thought 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
much 1
larger 1
gift 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
if 1
his 1
brother 1
had 1
received 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
only 1
a 1
turnip 1
what 1
must 1
his 1
present 1
be 1
worth 1
the 1
king 1
took 1
the 1
gift 1
very 1
graciously 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
give 1
in 1
return 1
more 1
valuable 1
and 1
wonderful 1
than 1
the 1
great 1
turnip 1
so 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
cart 1
and 1
drag 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
home 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
upon 1
whom 1
to 1
vent 1
his 1
rage 1
and 1
spite 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
wicked 1
thoughts 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
he 1
resolved 1
to 1
kill 1
his 1
brother 1
so 1
he 1
hired 1
some 1
villains 1
to 1
murder 1
him 1
and 1
having 1
shown 1
them 1
where 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
ambush 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
brother 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
dig 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
share 1
it 1
between 1
us 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
no 1
suspicions 1
of 1
his 1
roguery 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
travelling 1
along 1
the 1
murderers 1
rushed 1
out 1
upon 1
him 1
bound 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
hang 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
but 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
getting 1
all 1
ready 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
trampling 1
of 1
a 1
horse 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
which 1
so 1
frightened 1
them 1
that 1
they 1
pushed 1
their 1
prisoner 1
neck 1
and 1
shoulders 1
together 1
into 1
a 1
sack 1
and 1
swung 1
him 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
cord 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
they 1
left 1
him 1
dangling 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
meantime 1
he 1
worked 1
and 1
worked 1
away 1
till 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
hole 1
large 1
enough 1
to 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
head 1
when 1
the 1
horseman 1
came 1
up 1
he 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
student 1
a 1
merry 1
fellow 1
who 1
was 1
journeying 1
along 1
on 1
his 1
nag 1
and 1
singing 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
sack 1
saw 1
him 1
passing 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
good 1
morning 1
good 1
morning 1
to 1
thee 1
my 1
friend 1
the 1
student 1
looked 1
about 1
everywhere 1
and 1
seeing 1
no 1
one 1
and 1
not 1
knowing 1
where 1
the 1
voice 1
came 1
from 1
cried 1
out 1
who 1
calls 1
me 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
answered 1
lift 1
up 1
thine 1
eyes 1
for 1
behold 1
here 1
i 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
wisdom 1
here 1
have 1
i 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
learned 1
great 1
and 1
wondrous 1
things 1
compared 1
to 1
this 1
seat 1
all 1
the 1
learning 1
of 1
the 1
schools 1
is 1
as 1
empty 1
air 1
a 1
little 1
longer 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
man 1
can 1
know 1
and 1
shall 1
come 1
forth 1
wiser 1
than 1
the 1
wisest 1
of 1
mankind 1
here 1
i 1
discern 1
the 1
signs 1
and 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
the 1
laws 1
that 1
control 1
the 1
winds 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
the 1
sands 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
the 1
healing 1
of 1
the 1
sick 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
all 1
simples 1
of 1
birds 1
and 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
wert 1
thou 1
but 1
once 1
here 1
my 1
friend 1
though 1
wouldst 1
feel 1
and 1
own 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
knowledge 1
the 1
student 1
listened 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
wondered 1
much 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
blessed 1
be 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
hour 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
you 1
cannot 1
you 1
contrive 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
sack 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
as 1
if 1
very 1
unwillingly 1
a 1
little 1
space 1
i 1
may 1
allow 1
thee 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
if 1
thou 1
wilt 1
reward 1
me 1
well 1
and 1
entreat 1
me 1
kindly 1
but 1
thou 1
must 1
tarry 1
yet 1
an 1
hour 1
below 1
till 1
i 1
have 1
learnt 1
some 1
little 1
matters 1
that 1
are 1
yet 1
unknown 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
the 1
student 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
waited 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
the 1
time 1
hung 1
heavy 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
begged 1
earnestly 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
ascend 1
forthwith 1
for 1
his 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
was 1
great 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
pretended 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
and 1
said 1
thou 1
must 1
let 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
wisdom 1
descend 1
by 1
untying 1
yonder 1
cord 1
and 1
then 1
thou 1
shalt 1
enter 1
so 1
the 1
student 1
let 1
him 1
down 1
opened 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
now 1
then 1
cried 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
ascend 1
quickly 1
as 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
put 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
sack 1
heels 1
first 1
wait 1
a 1
while 1
said 1
the 1
gardener 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
way 1
then 1
he 1
pushed 1
him 1
in 1
head 1
first 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
soon 1
swung 1
up 1
the 1
searcher 1
after 1
wisdom 1
dangling 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
how 1
is 1
it 1
with 1
thee 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
dost 1
thou 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
wisdom 1
comes 1
unto 1
thee 1
rest 1
there 1
in 1
peace 1
till 1
thou 1
art 1
a 1
wiser 1
man 1
than 1
thou 1
wert 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
trotted 1
off 1
on 1
the 1
students 1
nag 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
to 1
gather 1
wisdom 1
till 1
somebody 1
should 1
come 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
down 1

with 1

youth 1

sent 1
into 1
a 1
strange 1
town 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
with 1
the 1
master 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
asked 1
now 1
my 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
father 1
i 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1

when 1
they 1

another 1
town 1
to 1
another 1
master 1
the 1
youth 1
was 1
taken 1
thither 1
and 1
stayed 1
a 1
year 1
with 1
this 1
master 1
likewise 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
the 1
father 1
again 1
asked 1
my 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
he 1
answered 1
father 1
i 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1
birds 1
say 1
then 1
the 1
father 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
said 1
oh 1
you 1
lost 1
man 1
you 1
have 1
spent 1
the 1
precious 1
time 1
and 1
learnt 1
nothing 1

you 1
not 1
ashamed 1
to 1
appear 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
will 1
send 1
you 1
to 1
a 1
third 1
master 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
learn 1
nothing 1
this 1
time 1
also 1
i 1
will 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
your 1
father 1
the 1
youth 1
remained 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
with 1
the 1
third 1
master 1
also 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
inquired 1
my 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
he 1
answered 1
dear 1
father 1
i 1
have 1
this 1
year 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1
frogs 1
croak 1
then 1
the 1
father 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
furious 1
anger 1
sprang 1
up 1
called 1
his 1
people 1
thither 1
and 1
said 1
this 1
man 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
my 1
son 1
i 1
drive 1
him 1
forth 1
and 1
command 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
forth 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
killed 1
him 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
pity 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
eyes 1
and 1
tongue 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
deer 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
carry 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
token 1
the 1
youth 1
wandered 1
on 1
and 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
fortress 1
where 1
he 1
begged 1
for 1
a 1
nights 1
lodging 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
tower 1
go 1
thither 1
but 1
i 1
warn 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
wild 1
dogs 1
which 1
bark 1
and 1
howl 1
without 1
stopping 1
and 1
at 1
certain 1
hours 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
to 1
them 1
whom 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
devour 1
the 1
whole 1
district 1
was 1
in 1
sorrow 1
and 1
dismay 1
because 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
yet 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
stop 1
this 1
the 1
youth 1
however 1
was 1
without 1
fear 1
and 1
said 1
just 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
barking 1
dogs 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
throw 1
to 1
them 1
they 1
will 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
harm 1
me 1
as 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
some 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
inside 1
the 1
dogs 1
did 1
not 1
bark 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
wagged 1
their 1
tails 1
quite 1
amicably 1
around 1
him 1
ate 1
what 1
he 1
set 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
hurt 1
one 1
hair 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
next 1
morning 1
to 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
everyone 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
safe 1
and 1
unharmed 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
the 1
dogs 1
have 1
revealed 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
language 1
why 1
they 1
dwell 1
there 1
and 1
bring 1
evil 1
on 1
the 1
land 1
they 1
are 1
bewitched 1
and 1
are 1
obliged 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
a 1
great 1
treasure 1
which 1
is 1
below 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
taken 1
away 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
likewise 1
learnt 1
from 1
their 1
discourse 1
how 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
then 1
all 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
rejoiced 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
adopt 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
son 1
if 1
he 1
accomplished 1
it 1
successfully 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
thoroughly 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
chest 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
out 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
howling 1
of 1
the 1
wild 1
dogs 1
was 1
henceforth 1
heard 1
no 1
more 1
they 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
trouble 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
travel 1
to 1
rome 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
marsh 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
frogs 1
were 1
sitting 1
croaking 1
he 1
listened 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
saying 1
he 1
grew 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
and 1
sad 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
arrived 1
in 1
rome 1
where 1
the 1
pope 1
had 1
just 1
died 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
doubt 1
among 1
the 1
cardinals 1
as 1
to 1
whom 1
they 1
should 1
appoint 1
as 1
his 1
successor 1
they 1
at 1
length 1
agreed 1
that 1
the 1
person 1
should 1
be 1
chosen 1
as 1
pope 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
distinguished 1
by 1
some 1
divine 1
and 1
miraculous 1
token 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
that 1
was 1
decided 1
on 1
the 1
young 1
count 1
entered 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
suddenly 1
two 1
snowwhite 1
doves 1
flew 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
remained 1
sitting 1
there 1
the 1
ecclesiastics 1
recognized 1
therein 1
the 1
token 1
from 1
above 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
pope 1
he 1
was 1
undecided 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
worthy 1
of 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
doves 1
counselled 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
said 1
yes 1
then 1
was 1
he 1
anointed 1
and 1
consecrated 1
and 1
thus 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
from 1
the 1
frogs 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
which 1
had 1
so 1
affected 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
holiness 1
the 1
pope 1
then 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
sing 1
a 1
mass 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
doves 1
sat 1
continually 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
cat 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
he 1
is 1
clever 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
experience 1
and 1
much 1
esteemed 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
friendly 1
way 1
good 1
day 1
dear 1
mr 1
fox 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
how 1
is 1
all 1
with 1
you 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
getting 1
on 1
in 1
these 1
hard 1
times 1
the 1
fox 1
full 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
arrogance 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
cat 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
any 1
answer 1
or 1
not 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
oh 1
you 1
wretched 1
beardcleaner 1
you 1
piebald 1
fool 1
you 1
hungry 1
mousehunter 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
thinking 1
of 1
have 1
you 1
the 1
cheek 1
to 1
ask 1
how 1
i 1
am 1
getting 1
on 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
how 1
many 1
arts 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
i 1
understand 1
but 1
one 1
replied 1
the 1
cat 1
modestly 1
what 1
art 1
is 1
that 1
asked 1
the 1
fox 1
when 1
the 1
hounds 1
are 1
following 1
me 1
i 1
can 1
spring 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
save 1
myself 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
i 1
am 1
master 1
of 1
a 1
hundred 1
arts 1
and 1
have 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
a 1
sackful 1
of 1
cunning 1
you 1
make 1
me 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
teach 1
you 1
how 1
people 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
hounds 1
just 1
then 1
came 1
a 1
hunter 1
with 1
four 1
dogs 1
the 1
cat 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
up 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
where 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
foliage 1
quite 1
concealed 1
her 1
open 1
your 1
sack 1
mr 1
fox 1
open 1
your 1
sack 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
dogs 1
had 1
already 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
holding 1
him 1
fast 1
ah 1
mr 1
fox 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
you 1
with 1
your 1
hundred 1
arts 1
are 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
lurch 1
had 1
you 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
climb 1
like 1
me 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
lost 1
your 1
life 1
the 1
four 1
clever 1
brothers 1
dear 1
children 1
said 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
to 1
his 1
four 1
sons 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
try 1
your 1
luck 1
begin 1
by 1
learning 1
some 1
craft 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
see 1
how 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
on 1
so 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
took 1
their 1
walkingsticks 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
their 1
little 1
bundles 1
on 1
their 1
shoulders 1
and 1
after 1
bidding 1
their 1
father 1
goodbye 1
went 1
all 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
together 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
on 1
some 1
way 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
four 1
crossways 1
each 1
leading 1
to 1
a 1
different 1
country 1
then 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
here 1
we 1
must 1
part 1
but 1
this 1
day 1
four 1
years 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
this 1
spot 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
each 1
must 1
try 1
what 1
he 1
can 1
do 1
for 1
himself 1
so 1
each 1
brother 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
eldest 1
was 1
hastening 1
on 1
a 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
my 1
luck 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
begin 1
by 1
learning 1
some 1
art 1
or 1
trade 1
answered 1
he 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
teach 1
you 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
cunningest 1
thief 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
honest 1
calling 1
and 1
what 1
can 1
one 1
look 1
to 1
earn 1
by 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
but 1
the 1
gallows 1
oh 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
fear 1
the 1
gallows 1
for 1
i 1
will 1
only 1
teach 1
you 1
to 1
steal 1
what 1
will 1
be 1
fair 1
game 1
i 1
meddle 1
with 1
nothing 1
but 1
what 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
can 1
get 1
or 1
care 1
anything 1
about 1
and 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
find 1
you 1
out 1
so 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
agreed 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
trade 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
showed 1
himself 1
so 1
clever 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
escape 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
set 1
his 1
mind 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
brother 1
also 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
out 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
setting 1
out 1
upon 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
craft 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
follow 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
yet 1
said 1
he 1
then 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
stargazer 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
noble 1
art 1
for 1
nothing 1
can 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
when 1
once 1
you 1
understand 1
the 1
stars 1
the 1
plan 1
pleased 1
him 1
much 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
became 1
such 1
a 1
skilful 1
stargazer 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
served 1
out 1
his 1
time 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
with 1
this 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
passing 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
on 1
earth 1
and 1
nothing 1
can 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
the 1
third 1
brother 1
met 1
a 1
huntsman 1
who 1
took 1
him 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
taught 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
all 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
hunting 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
very 1
clever 1
in 1
the 1
craft 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
said 1
whatever 1
you 1
shoot 1
at 1
with 1
this 1
bow 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
hit 1
the 1
youngest 1
brother 1
likewise 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
do 1
would 1
not 1
you 1
like 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
tailor 1
oh 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sitting 1
crosslegged 1
from 1
morning 1
to 1
night 1
working 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
with 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
goose 1
will 1
never 1
suit 1
me 1
oh 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
sort 1
of 1
tailoring 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
learn 1
quite 1
another 1
kind 1
of 1
craft 1
from 1
that 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
plan 1
and 1
learnt 1
tailoring 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
can 1
sew 1
anything 1
with 1
this 1
be 1
it 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
an 1
egg 1
or 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
steel 1
and 1
the 1
joint 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
fine 1
that 1
no 1
seam 1
will 1
be 1
seen 1
after 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
four 1
years 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
agreed 1
upon 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
four 1
crossroads 1
and 1
having 1
welcomed 1
each 1
other 1
set 1
off 1
towards 1
their 1
fathers 1
home 1
where 1
they 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
how 1
each 1
had 1
learned 1
some 1
craft 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
before 1
the 1
house 1
under 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
tree 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
what 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
so 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
tree 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
chaffinchs 1
nest 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
many 1
eggs 1
there 1
are 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
stargazer 1
took 1
his 1
glass 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
five 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
to 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
take 1
away 1
the 1
eggs 1
without 1
letting 1
the 1
bird 1
that 1
is 1
sitting 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
hatching 1
them 1
know 1
anything 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
doing 1
so 1
the 1
cunning 1
thief 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
brought 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
five 1
eggs 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
it 1
never 1
saw 1
or 1
felt 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
but 1
kept 1
sitting 1
on 1
at 1
its 1
ease 1
then 1
the 1
father 1
took 1
the 1
eggs 1
and 1
put 1
one 1
on 1
each 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
fifth 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
huntsman 1
cut 1
all 1
the 1
eggs 1
in 1
two 1
pieces 1
at 1
one 1
shot 1
the 1
huntsman 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
at 1
one 1
shot 1
struck 1
all 1
the 1
five 1
eggs 1
as 1
his 1
father 1
wished 1
now 1
comes 1
your 1
turn 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
tailor 1
sew 1
the 1
eggs 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
birds 1
in 1
them 1
together 1
again 1
so 1
neatly 1
that 1
the 1
shot 1
shall 1
have 1
done 1
them 1
no 1
harm 1
then 1
the 1
tailor 1
took 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
sewed 1
the 1
eggs 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
thief 1
was 1
sent 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
under 1
the 1
bird 1
without 1
its 1
knowing 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
sitting 1
and 1
hatched 1
them 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
they 1
crawled 1
out 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
red 1
streak 1
across 1
their 1
necks 1
where 1
the 1
tailor 1
had 1
sewn 1
them 1
together 1
well 1
done 1
sons 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
good 1
use 1
of 1
your 1
time 1
and 1
learnt 1
something 1
worth 1
the 1
knowing 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
which 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
prize 1
oh 1
that 1
a 1
time 1
might 1
soon 1
come 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
turn 1
your 1
skill 1
to 1
some 1
account 1
not 1
long 1
after 1
this 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
bustle 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
for 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
off 1
by 1
a 1
mighty 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
mourned 1
over 1
his 1
loss 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
that 1
whoever 1
brought 1
her 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
should 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
wife 1
then 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
said 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
chance 1
for 1
us 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
what 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
and 1
they 1
agreed 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
set 1
the 1
princess 1
free 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
she 1
is 1
however 1
said 1
the 1
stargazer 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
through 1
his 1
glass 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
cried 1
out 1
i 1
see 1
her 1
afar 1
off 1
sitting 1
upon 1
a 1
rock 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
spy 1
the 1
dragon 1
close 1
by 1
guarding 1
her 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
ship 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
brothers 1
and 1
they 1
sailed 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
sea 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
place 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
princess 1
sitting 1
as 1
the 1
stargazer 1
had 1
said 1
on 1
the 1
rock 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
was 1
lying 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
upon 1
her 1
lap 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
shoot 1
at 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
for 1
i 1
should 1
kill 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
also 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
my 1
skill 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
stole 1
her 1
away 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
dragon 1
so 1
quietly 1
and 1
gently 1
that 1
the 1
beast 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
but 1
went 1
on 1
snoring 1
then 1
away 1
they 1
hastened 1
with 1
her 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
in 1
their 1
boat 1
towards 1
the 1
ship 1
but 1
soon 1
came 1
the 1
dragon 1
roaring 1
behind 1
them 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
for 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
missed 1
the 1
princess 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
over 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
pounce 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
carry 1
off 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
huntsman 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
shot 1
him 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
heart 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
they 1
were 1
still 1
not 1
safe 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
beast 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
fall 1
he 1
overset 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
swim 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
upon 1
a 1
few 1
planks 1
so 1
the 1
tailor 1
took 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
large 1
stitches 1
put 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
planks 1
together 1
and 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
these 1
and 1
sailed 1
about 1
and 1
gathered 1
up 1
all 1
pieces 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
then 1
tacked 1
them 1
together 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
soon 1
ready 1
and 1
they 1
then 1
reached 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
got 1
home 1
safe 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
brought 1
home 1
the 1
princess 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
shall 1
marry 1
her 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
settle 1
amongst 1
yourselves 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
then 1
there 1
arose 1
a 1
quarrel 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
stargazer 1
said 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
the 1
princess 1
out 1
all 1
your 1
skill 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
therefore 1
she 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
your 1
seeing 1
her 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
taken 1
her 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dragon 1
therefore 1
she 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
no 1
she 1
is 1
mine 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
for 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
killed 1
the 1
dragon 1
he 1
would 1
after 1
all 1
have 1
torn 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
into 1
pieces 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
sewn 1
the 1
boat 1
together 1
again 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
you 1
would 1
all 1
have 1
been 1
drowned 1
therefore 1
she 1
is 1
mine 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
said 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
right 1
and 1
as 1
all 1
cannot 1
have 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
is 1
for 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
there 1
is 1
somebody 1
she 1
likes 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
better 1
but 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
your 1
loss 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
reward 1
for 1
his 1
skill 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
so 1
the 1
brothers 1
agreed 1
that 1
this 1
plan 1
would 1
be 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
either 1
quarrelling 1
or 1
marrying 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
mind 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
then 1
gave 1
to 1
each 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
very 1
happily 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
their 1
days 1
and 1
took 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
their 1
father 1
and 1
somebody 1
took 1
better 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
than 1
to 1
let 1
either 1
the 1
dragon 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
craftsmen 1
have 1
her 1
again 1
lily 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
daughters 1
was 1
once 1
setting 1
out 1
upon 1
a 1
journey 1
but 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
he 1
asked 1
each 1
daughter 1
what 1
gift 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
back 1
for 1
her 1
the 1
eldest 1
wished 1
for 1
pearls 1
the 1
second 1
for 1
jewels 1
but 1
the 1
third 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
lily 1
said 1
dear 1
father 1
bring 1
me 1
a 1
rose 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
easy 1
task 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
rose 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
winter 1
yet 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
his 1
prettiest 1
daughter 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
flowers 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
kissed 1
all 1
three 1
and 1
bid 1
them 1
goodbye 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
he 1
had 1
bought 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
for 1
the 1
two 1
eldest 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
sought 1
everywhere 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
any 1
garden 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
the 1
people 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
thought 1
roses 1
grew 1
in 1
snow 1
this 1
grieved 1
him 1
very 1
much 1
for 1
lily 1
was 1
his 1
dearest 1
child 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
journeying 1
home 1
thinking 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
her 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
fine 1
castle 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
in 1
one 1
half 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
summertime 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
half 1
winter 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
the 1
finest 1
flowers 1
were 1
in 1
full 1
bloom 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
everything 1
looked 1
dreary 1
and 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
a 1
lucky 1
hit 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bed 1
of 1
roses 1
that 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
away 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
flowers 1
this 1
done 1
they 1
were 1
riding 1
away 1
well 1
pleased 1
when 1
up 1
sprang 1
a 1
fierce 1
lion 1
and 1
roared 1
out 1
whoever 1
has 1
stolen 1
my 1
roses 1
shall 1
be 1
eaten 1
up 1
alive 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
that 1
the 1
garden 1
belonged 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
nothing 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
lion 1
nothing 1
unless 1
you 1
undertake 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
whatever 1
meets 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
return 1
home 1
if 1
you 1
agree 1
to 1
this 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
your 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
rose 1
too 1
for 1
your 1
daughter 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
my 1
youngest 1
daughter 1
who 1
loves 1
me 1
most 1
and 1
always 1
runs 1
to 1
meet 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
the 1
servant 1
was 1
greatly 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
may 1
perhaps 1
be 1
only 1
a 1
cat 1
or 1
a 1
dog 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
man 1
yielded 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
heart 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
the 1
lion 1
whatever 1
should 1
meet 1
him 1
first 1
on 1
his 1
return 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
home 1
it 1
was 1
lily 1
his 1
youngest 1
and 1
dearest 1
daughter 1
that 1
met 1
him 1
she 1
came 1
running 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
welcomed 1
him 1
home 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
the 1
rose 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
more 1
glad 1
but 1
her 1
father 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
to 1
weep 1
saying 1
alas 1
my 1
dearest 1
child 1
i 1
have 1
bought 1
this 1
flower 1
at 1
a 1
high 1
price 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
a 1
wild 1
lion 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
you 1
he 1
will 1
tear 1
you 1
in 1
pieces 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
not 1
go 1
let 1
what 1
would 1
happen 1
but 1
she 1
comforted 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
father 1
the 1
word 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
must 1
be 1
kept 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
soothe 1
him 1
perhaps 1
he 1
will 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
safe 1
home 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
she 1
asked 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
went 1
forth 1
with 1
a 1
bold 1
heart 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
but 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
by 1
day 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
court 1
were 1
lions 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
right 1
forms 1
again 1
and 1
when 1
lily 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
he 1
welcomed 1
her 1
so 1
courteously 1
that 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
the 1
weddingfeast 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
prince 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
court 1
but 1
every 1
morning 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
bride 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
by 1
himself 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
whither 1
till 1
the 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
tomorrow 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
in 1
your 1
fathers 1
house 1
for 1
your 1
eldest 1
sister 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
visit 1
her 1
my 1
lions 1
shall 1
lead 1
you 1
thither 1
then 1
she 1
rejoiced 1
much 1
at 1
the 1
thoughts 1
of 1
seeing 1
her 1
father 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
lions 1
and 1
everyone 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
thought 1
her 1
dead 1
long 1
since 1
but 1
she 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
happy 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
stayed 1
till 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
her 1
second 1
sister 1
was 1
soon 1
after 1
married 1
and 1
when 1
lily 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
wedding 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
prince 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
alone 1
this 1
timeyou 1
must 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
hazardous 1
thing 1
for 1
if 1
the 1
least 1
ray 1
of 1
the 1
torchlight 1
should 1
fall 1
upon 1
him 1
his 1
enchantment 1
would 1
become 1
still 1
worse 1
for 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
dove 1
and 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
wander 1
about 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
seven 1
long 1
years 1
however 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
no 1
rest 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
take 1
care 1
no 1
light 1
should 1
fall 1
upon 1
him 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
took 1
with 1
them 1
their 1
little 1
child 1
and 1
she 1
chose 1
a 1
large 1
hall 1
with 1
thick 1
walls 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
while 1
the 1
weddingtorches 1
were 1
lighted 1
but 1
unluckily 1
no 1
one 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
with 1
great 1
pomp 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
passed 1
with 1
the 1
torches 1
before 1
the 1
hall 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
ray 1
of 1
light 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
prince 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
disappeared 1
and 1
when 1
his 1
wife 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
found 1
only 1
a 1
white 1
dove 1
and 1
it 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
seven 1
years 1
must 1
i 1
fly 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
over 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
but 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
let 1
fall 1
a 1
white 1
feather 1
that 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
follow 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
you 1
may 1
overtake 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
this 1
said 1
he 1
flew 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
poor 1
lily 1
followed 1
and 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
white 1
feather 1
fell 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
journey 1
thus 1
she 1
went 1
roving 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
looked 1
neither 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
nor 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
nor 1
took 1
any 1
rest 1
for 1
seven 1
years 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
glad 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
fast 1
coming 1
when 1
all 1
her 1
troubles 1
should 1
end 1
yet 1
repose 1
was 1
still 1
far 1
off 1
for 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
travelling 1
on 1
she 1
missed 1
the 1
white 1
feather 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
her 1
eyes 1
she 1
could 1
nowhere 1
see 1
the 1
dove 1
now 1
thought 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
no 1
aid 1
of 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
said 1
thou 1
shinest 1
everywhere 1
on 1
the 1
hills 1
top 1
and 1
the 1
valleys 1
depthhast 1
thou 1
anywhere 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
sun 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
a 1
casketopen 1
it 1
when 1
thy 1
hour 1
of 1
need 1
comes 1
so 1
she 1
thanked 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
till 1
eventide 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
moon 1
arose 1
she 1
cried 1
unto 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
thou 1
shinest 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
over 1
field 1
and 1
grovehast 1
thou 1
nowhere 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
moon 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
thee 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
an 1
eggbreak 1
it 1
when 1
need 1
comes 1
then 1
she 1
thanked 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
the 1
nightwind 1
blew 1
and 1
she 1
raised 1
up 1
her 1
voice 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
thou 1
blowest 1
through 1
every 1
tree 1
and 1
under 1
every 1
leafhast 1
thou 1
not 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
nightwind 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
ask 1
three 1
other 1
winds 1
perhaps 1
they 1
have 1
seen 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
east 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
west 1
wind 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
too 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
south 1
wind 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
white 1
dovehe 1
has 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
red 1
sea 1
and 1
is 1
changed 1
once 1
more 1
into 1
a 1
lion 1
for 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
are 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
fighting 1
with 1
a 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
is 1
an 1
enchanted 1
princess 1
who 1
seeks 1
to 1
separate 1
him 1
from 1
you 1
then 1
the 1
nightwind 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
counsel 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
red 1
sea 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
shore 1
stand 1
many 1
rodscount 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
thou 1
comest 1
to 1
the 1
eleventh 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
smite 1
the 1
dragon 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
lion 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
victory 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
will 1
appear 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
forms 1
then 1
look 1
round 1
and 1
thou 1
wilt 1
see 1
a 1
griffin 1
winged 1
like 1
bird 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
red 1
sea 1
jump 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
with 1
thy 1
beloved 1
one 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
carry 1
you 1
over 1
the 1
waters 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
i 1
will 1
also 1
give 1
thee 1
this 1
nut 1
continued 1
the 1
nightwind 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
halfway 1
over 1
throw 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
waters 1
will 1
immediately 1
spring 1
up 1
a 1
high 1
nuttree 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
griffin 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
rest 1
otherwise 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
strength 1
to 1
bear 1
you 1
the 1
whole 1
way 1
if 1
therefore 1
thou 1
dost 1
forget 1
to 1
throw 1
down 1
the 1
nut 1
he 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
both 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
so 1
our 1
poor 1
wanderer 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
as 1
the 1
nightwind 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
plucked 1
the 1
eleventh 1
rod 1
and 1
smote 1
the 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
forthwith 1
became 1
a 1
prince 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
a 1
princess 1
again 1
but 1
no 1
sooner 1
was 1
the 1
princess 1
released 1
from 1
the 1
spell 1
than 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
prince 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
sprang 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
griffins 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
carrying 1
the 1
prince 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
thus 1
the 1
unhappy 1
traveller 1
was 1
again 1
forsaken 1
and 1
forlorn 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
blows 1
and 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
cock 1
crows 1
i 1
will 1
journey 1
on 1
till 1
i 1
find 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
long 1
way 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
whither 1
the 1
princess 1
had 1
carried 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
feast 1
got 1
ready 1
and 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
heaven 1
aid 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
casket 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
within 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
dress 1
as 1
dazzling 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
itself 1
so 1
she 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
gazed 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
dress 1
pleased 1
the 1
bride 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
she 1
asked 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sold 1
not 1
for 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
said 1
she 1
but 1
for 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
the 1
princess 1
asked 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
let 1
me 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
this 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
the 1
dress 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
princess 1
agreed 1
but 1
she 1
told 1
her 1
chamberlain 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
prince 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
hear 1
or 1
see 1
her 1
when 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
into 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
followed 1
thee 1
seven 1
years 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
the 1
nightwind 1
to 1
seek 1
thee 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
have 1
helped 1
thee 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
dragon 1
wilt 1
thou 1
then 1
forget 1
me 1
quite 1
but 1
the 1
prince 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
slept 1
so 1
soundly 1
that 1
her 1
voice 1
only 1
passed 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
like 1
the 1
whistling 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
among 1
the 1
firtrees 1
then 1
poor 1
lily 1
was 1
led 1
away 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
golden 1
dress 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
meadow 1
and 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
but 1
as 1
she 1
sat 1
she 1
bethought 1
herself 1
of 1
the 1
egg 1
that 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
broke 1
it 1
there 1
ran 1
out 1
a 1
hen 1
and 1
twelve 1
chickens 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
that 1
played 1
about 1
and 1
then 1
nestled 1
under 1
the 1
old 1
ones 1
wings 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
form 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
she 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
drove 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
till 1
the 1
bride 1
saw 1
them 1
from 1
her 1
window 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
forth 1
and 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
sell 1
the 1
brood 1
not 1
for 1
gold 1
or 1
silver 1
but 1
for 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
let 1
me 1
again 1
this 1
evening 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
the 1
whole 1
brood 1
then 1
the 1
princess 1
thought 1
to 1
betray 1
her 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
agreed 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
asked 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
prince 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
chamberlain 1
why 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
whistled 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
chamberlain 1
told 1
him 1
allhow 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
poor 1
maiden 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
that 1
night 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
took 1
care 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
the 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
and 1
when 1
lily 1
came 1
and 1
began 1
again 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
woes 1
had 1
befallen 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
faithful 1
and 1
true 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
he 1
knew 1
his 1
beloved 1
wifes 1
voice 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
awakened 1
me 1
as 1
from 1
a 1
dream 1
for 1
the 1
strange 1
princess 1
had 1
thrown 1
a 1
spell 1
around 1
me 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
altogether 1
forgotten 1
you 1
but 1
heaven 1
hath 1
sent 1
you 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
lucky 1
hour 1
and 1
they 1
stole 1
away 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
by 1
night 1
unawares 1
and 1
seated 1
themselves 1
on 1
the 1
griffin 1
who 1
flew 1
back 1
with 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
red 1
sea 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
halfway 1
across 1
lily 1
let 1
the 1
nut 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
immediately 1
a 1
large 1
nuttree 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
whereon 1
the 1
griffin 1
rested 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
carried 1
them 1
safely 1
home 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
their 1
child 1
now 1
grown 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
comely 1
and 1
fair 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
their 1
troubles 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
their 1
days 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
a 1
farmer 1
had 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
an 1
excellent 1
faithful 1
servant 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
grown 1
too 1
old 1
to 1
work 1
so 1
the 1
farmer 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
take 1
yourself 1
off 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
stable 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
take 1
you 1
back 1
again 1
until 1
you 1
are 1
stronger 1
than 1
a 1
lion 1
then 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
turned 1
him 1
adrift 1
the 1
poor 1
horse 1
was 1
very 1
melancholy 1
and 1
wandered 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
seeking 1
some 1
little 1
shelter 1
from 1
the 1
cold 1
wind 1
and 1
rain 1
presently 1
a 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
whats 1
the 1
matter 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
hang 1
down 1
your 1
head 1
and 1
look 1
so 1
lonely 1
and 1
woebegone 1
ah 1
replied 1
the 1
horse 1
justice 1
and 1
avarice 1
never 1
dwell 1
in 1
one 1
house 1
my 1
master 1
has 1
forgotten 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
because 1
i 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
work 1
he 1
has 1
turned 1
me 1
adrift 1
and 1
says 1
unless 1
i 1
become 1
stronger 1
than 1
a 1
lion 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
back 1
again 1
what 1
chance 1
can 1
i 1
have 1
of 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
i 1
have 1
none 1
or 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
talk 1
so 1
however 1
the 1
fox 1
bid 1
him 1
be 1
of 1
good 1
cheer 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
lie 1
down 1
there 1
stretch 1
yourself 1
out 1
quite 1
stiff 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
dead 1
the 1
horse 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
cave 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
off 1
lies 1
a 1
dead 1
horse 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
make 1
an 1
excellent 1
meal 1
of 1
his 1
carcase 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
greatly 1
pleased 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
immediately 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
eat 1
him 1
comfortably 1
here 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
whati 1
will 1
tie 1
you 1
fast 1
to 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
draw 1
him 1
to 1
your 1
den 1
and 1
eat 1
him 1
at 1
your 1
leisure 1
this 1
advice 1
pleased 1
the 1
lion 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
quietly 1
for 1
the 1
fox 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
fast 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
but 1
the 1
fox 1
managed 1
to 1
tie 1
his 1
legs 1
together 1
and 1
bound 1
all 1
so 1
hard 1
and 1
fast 1
that 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
set 1
himself 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
done 1
the 1
fox 1
clapped 1
the 1
horse 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
jip 1
dobbin 1
jip 1
then 1
up 1
he 1
sprang 1
and 1
moved 1
off 1
dragging 1
the 1
lion 1
behind 1
him 1
the 1
beast 1
began 1
to 1
roar 1
and 1
bellow 1
till 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
flew 1
away 1
for 1
fright 1
but 1
the 1
horse 1
let 1
him 1
sing 1
on 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
quietly 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
to 1
his 1
masters 1
house 1
here 1
he 1
is 1
master 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
better 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
farmer 1
saw 1
his 1
old 1
servant 1
his 1
heart 1
relented 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
thou 1
shalt 1
stay 1
in 1
thy 1
stable 1
and 1
be 1
well 1
taken 1
care 1
of 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
poor 1
old 1
horse 1
had 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
livedtill 1
he 1
died 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
soldier 1
who 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
had 1
served 1
the 1
king 1
faithfully 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
war 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
could 1
serve 1
no 1
longer 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
many 1
wounds 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
may 1
return 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
i 1
need 1
you 1
no 1
longer 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
receive 1
any 1
more 1
money 1
for 1
he 1
only 1
receives 1
wages 1
who 1
renders 1
me 1
service 1
for 1
them 1
then 1
the 1
soldier 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
living 1
went 1
away 1
greatly 1
troubled 1
and 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
until 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
entered 1
a 1
forest 1
when 1
darkness 1
came 1
on 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
light 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
wherein 1
lived 1
a 1
witch 1
do 1
give 1
me 1
one 1
nights 1
lodging 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
her 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
starve 1
oho 1
she 1
answered 1
who 1
gives 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
runaway 1
soldier 1
yet 1
will 1
i 1
be 1
compassionate 1
and 1
take 1
you 1
in 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
wish 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
wish 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
dig 1
all 1
round 1
my 1
garden 1
for 1
me 1
tomorrow 1
the 1
soldier 1
consented 1
and 1
next 1
day 1
laboured 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
finish 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
evening 1
i 1
see 1
well 1
enough 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
no 1
more 1
today 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
you 1
yet 1
another 1
night 1
in 1
payment 1
for 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
tomorrow 1
chop 1
me 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
chop 1
it 1
small 1
the 1
soldier 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
in 1
doing 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
witch 1
proposed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
stay 1
one 1
night 1
more 1
tomorrow 1
you 1
shall 1
only 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
very 1
trifling 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
behind 1
my 1
house 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
dry 1
well 1
into 1
which 1
my 1
light 1
has 1
fallen 1
it 1
burns 1
blue 1
and 1
never 1
goes 1
out 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
bring 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
basket 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
signal 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
up 1
again 1
she 1
did 1
draw 1
him 1
up 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
edge 1
she 1
stretched 1
down 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
no 1
said 1
he 1
perceiving 1
her 1
evil 1
intention 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
light 1
until 1
i 1
am 1
standing 1
with 1
both 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
witch 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
let 1
him 1
fall 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
the 1
poor 1
soldier 1
fell 1
without 1
injury 1
on 1
the 1
moist 1
ground 1
and 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
went 1
on 1
burning 1
but 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
was 1
that 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
saw 1
very 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
escape 1
death 1
he 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
very 1
sorrowfully 1
then 1
suddenly 1
he 1
felt 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
found 1
his 1
tobacco 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
still 1
half 1
full 1
this 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
last 1
pleasure 1
thought 1
he 1
pulled 1
it 1
out 1
lit 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
smoke 1
when 1
the 1
smoke 1
had 1
circled 1
about 1
the 1
cavern 1
suddenly 1
a 1
little 1
black 1
dwarf 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
lord 1
what 1
are 1
your 1
commands 1
what 1
my 1
commands 1
are 1
replied 1
the 1
soldier 1
quite 1
astonished 1
i 1
must 1
do 1
everything 1
you 1
bid 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
good 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
help 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
well 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
took 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
through 1
an 1
underground 1
passage 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
forget 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
with 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
dwarf 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
treasures 1
which 1
the 1
witch 1
had 1
collected 1
and 1
hidden 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
took 1
as 1
much 1
gold 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
carry 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
above 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
now 1
go 1
and 1
bind 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
and 1
carry 1
her 1
before 1
the 1
judge 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
she 1
came 1
by 1
like 1
the 1
wind 1
riding 1
on 1
a 1
wild 1
tomcat 1
and 1
screaming 1
frightfully 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
reappeared 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
done 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
witch 1
is 1
already 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
gallows 1
what 1
further 1
commands 1
has 1
my 1
lord 1
inquired 1
the 1
dwarf 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
none 1
answered 1
the 1
soldier 1
you 1
can 1
return 1
home 1
only 1
be 1
at 1
hand 1
immediately 1
if 1
i 1
summon 1
you 1
nothing 1
more 1
is 1
needed 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
light 1
your 1
pipe 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
appear 1
before 1
you 1
at 1
once 1
thereupon 1
he 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
sight 1
the 1
soldier 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
came 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
inn 1
ordered 1
himself 1
handsome 1
clothes 1
and 1
then 1
bade 1
the 1
landlord 1
furnish 1
him 1
a 1
room 1
as 1
handsome 1
as 1
possible 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
had 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
summoned 1
the 1
little 1
black 1
manikin 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
served 1
the 1
king 1
faithfully 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
dismissed 1
me 1
and 1
left 1
me 1
to 1
hunger 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
revenge 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
do 1
asked 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
late 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
is 1
in 1
bed 1
bring 1
her 1
here 1
in 1
her 1
sleep 1
she 1
shall 1
do 1
servants 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
manikin 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
an 1
easy 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
dangerous 1
thing 1
for 1
you 1
for 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
discovered 1
you 1
will 1
fare 1
ill 1
when 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
had 1
struck 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
manikin 1
carried 1
in 1
the 1
princess 1
aha 1
are 1
you 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
soldier 1
get 1
to 1
your 1
work 1
at 1
once 1
fetch 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
sweep 1
the 1
chamber 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
this 1
he 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
said 1
pull 1
off 1
my 1
boots 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
threw 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
pick 1
them 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
clean 1
and 1
brighten 1
them 1
she 1
however 1
did 1
everything 1
he 1
bade 1
her 1
without 1
opposition 1
silently 1
and 1
with 1
halfshut 1
eyes 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
cock 1
crowed 1
the 1
manikin 1
carried 1
her 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
laid 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
bed 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
arose 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
dream 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
with 1
the 1
rapidity 1
of 1
lightning 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
taken 1
into 1
a 1
soldiers 1
room 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
upon 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
servant 1
sweep 1
his 1
room 1
clean 1
his 1
boots 1
and 1
do 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
menial 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
just 1
as 1
tired 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
really 1
had 1
done 1
everything 1
the 1
dream 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
true 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
advice 1
fill 1
your 1
pocket 1
full 1
of 1
peas 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
small 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
carried 1
away 1
again 1
they 1
will 1
fall 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
a 1
track 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
but 1
unseen 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
manikin 1
was 1
standing 1
beside 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
and 1
heard 1
all 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
sleeping 1
princess 1
was 1
again 1
carried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
some 1
peas 1
certainly 1
did 1
fall 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
but 1
they 1
made 1
no 1
track 1
for 1
the 1
crafty 1
manikin 1
had 1
just 1
before 1
scattered 1
peas 1
in 1
every 1
street 1
there 1
was 1
and 1
again 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
do 1
servants 1
work 1
until 1
cockcrow 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
his 1
people 1
out 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
track 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
in 1
every 1
street 1
poor 1
children 1
were 1
sitting 1
picking 1
up 1
peas 1
and 1
saying 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
rained 1
peas 1
last 1
night 1
we 1
must 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
else 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
keep 1
your 1
shoes 1
on 1
when 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
before 1
you 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
taken 1
hide 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
contrive 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
the 1
black 1
manikin 1
heard 1
this 1
plot 1
and 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
soldier 1
again 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
princess 1
revealed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
no 1
expedient 1
to 1
counteract 1
this 1
stratagem 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
shoe 1
were 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
soldiers 1
house 1
it 1
would 1
go 1
badly 1
with 1
him 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
bid 1
you 1
replied 1
the 1
soldier 1
and 1
again 1
this 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
work 1
like 1
a 1
servant 1
but 1
before 1
she 1
went 1
away 1
she 1
hid 1
her 1
shoe 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
entire 1
town 1
searched 1
for 1
his 1
daughters 1
shoe 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
at 1
the 1
soldiers 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
himself 1
who 1
at 1
the 1
entreaty 1
of 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
gone 1
outside 1
the 1
gate 1
was 1
soon 1
brought 1
back 1
and 1
thrown 1
into 1
prison 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
most 1
valuable 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
ducat 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
now 1
loaded 1
with 1
chains 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
his 1
dungeon 1
when 1
he 1
chanced 1
to 1
see 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
comrades 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
soldier 1
tapped 1
at 1
the 1
pane 1
of 1
glass 1
and 1
when 1
this 1
man 1
came 1
up 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
fetch 1
me 1
the 1
small 1
bundle 1
i 1
have 1
left 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
ducat 1
for 1
doing 1
it 1
his 1
comrade 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
alone 1
again 1
he 1
lighted 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
summoned 1
the 1
black 1
manikin 1
have 1
no 1
fear 1
said 1
the 1
latter 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
go 1
wheresoever 1
they 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
will 1
only 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
with 1
you 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
tried 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
nothing 1
wicked 1
the 1
judge 1
condemned 1
him 1
to 1
death 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
forth 1
to 1
die 1
he 1
begged 1
a 1
last 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
smoke 1
one 1
more 1
pipe 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
you 1
may 1
smoke 1
three 1
answered 1
the 1
king 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
spare 1
your 1
life 1
then 1
the 1
soldier 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
lighted 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
a 1
few 1
wreaths 1
of 1
smoke 1
had 1
ascended 1
the 1
manikin 1
was 1
there 1
with 1
a 1
small 1
cudgel 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
does 1
my 1
lord 1
command 1
strike 1
down 1
to 1
earth 1
that 1
false 1
judge 1
there 1
and 1
his 1
constable 1
and 1
spare 1
not 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
has 1
treated 1
me 1
so 1
ill 1
then 1
the 1
manikin 1
fell 1
on 1
them 1
like 1
lightning 1
darting 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
whosoever 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
touched 1
by 1
his 1
cudgel 1
fell 1
to 1
earth 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
stir 1
again 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
terrified 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
soldiers 1
mercy 1
and 1
merely 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
all 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
kingdom 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
the 1
raven 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
queen 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
daughter 1
still 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
run 1
alone 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
very 1
troublesome 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
could 1
not 1
quiet 1
it 1
do 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
she 1
grew 1
impatient 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
ravens 1
flying 1
round 1
the 1
castle 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
would 1
fly 1
away 1
then 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
peace 1
scarcely 1
were 1
the 1
words 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
the 1
child 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
flew 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
the 1
bird 1
took 1
its 1
flight 1
to 1
a 1
dark 1
wood 1
and 1
remained 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
parents 1
could 1
hear 1
nothing 1
of 1
their 1
child 1
long 1
after 1
this 1
a 1
man 1
was 1
making 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
raven 1
calling 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
voice 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
raven 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
kings 1
daughter 1
but 1
am 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
spell 1
of 1
some 1
enchantment 1
you 1
can 1
however 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
what 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
asked 1
she 1
replied 1
go 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
wherein 1
lives 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
she 1
will 1
offer 1
you 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
take 1
of 1
either 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
you 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
the 1
house 1
is 1
a 1
large 1
tanheap 1
and 1
on 1
that 1
you 1
must 1
stand 1
and 1
watch 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
drive 1
there 1
in 1
my 1
carriage 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
for 1
three 1
successive 1
days 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
drawn 1
by 1
four 1
white 1
the 1
second 1
by 1
four 1
chestnut 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
by 1
four 1
black 1
horses 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
fail 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
and 1
i 1
find 1
you 1
sleeping 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
set 1
free 1
the 1
man 1
promised 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
but 1
the 1
raven 1
said 1
alas 1
i 1
know 1
even 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
something 1
from 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
the 1
man 1
assured 1
her 1
again 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
touch 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
eat 1
or 1
drink 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
went 1
inside 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
poor 1
man 1
how 1
tired 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
rest 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
give 1
you 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
no 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
i 1
will 1
neither 1
eat 1
not 1
drink 1
but 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
and 1
urged 1
him 1
saying 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
eat 1
anything 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
might 1
take 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
wine 1
one 1
drink 1
counts 1
for 1
nothing 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
allowed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
and 1
drank 1
as 1
it 1
drew 1
towards 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
he 1
went 1
outside 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
mounted 1
the 1
tanheap 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
raven 1
suddenly 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
fatigue 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
resist 1
it 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
fully 1
determined 1
however 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
but 1
in 1
another 1
minute 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
accord 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
noises 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
awakened 1
him 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
the 1
raven 1
came 1
driving 1
along 1
drawn 1
by 1
her 1
four 1
white 1
horses 1
but 1
even 1
before 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
spot 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
sighing 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
when 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
she 1
found 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
feared 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
tanheap 1
fast 1
asleep 1
she 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
carriage 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
and 1
shook 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
still 1
continued 1
sleeping 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
at 1
noon 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
with 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
which 1
he 1
at 1
first 1
refused 1
at 1
last 1
overcome 1
by 1
her 1
persistent 1
entreaties 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
something 1
he 1
lifted 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
drank 1
again 1
towards 1
two 1
oclock 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
tanheap 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
the 1
raven 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
his 1
limbs 1
seemed 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
support 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stand 1
upright 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
again 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
as 1
the 1
raven 1
drove 1
along 1
her 1
four 1
chestnut 1
horses 1
she 1
said 1
sorrowfully 1
to 1
herself 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
she 1
went 1
as 1
before 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
slept 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
awaken 1
him 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
eating 1
or 1
drinking 1
anything 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
kill 1
yourself 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
may 1
not 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
either 1
eat 1
or 1
drink 1
but 1
she 1
put 1
down 1
the 1
dish 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
smelt 1
the 1
wine 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
resist 1
the 1
temptation 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
deep 1
draught 1
when 1
the 1
hour 1
came 1
round 1
again 1
he 1
went 1
as 1
usual 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
tanheap 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
even 1
more 1
overcome 1
with 1
weariness 1
than 1
on 1
the 1
two 1
previous 1
days 1
and 1
throwing 1
himself 1
down 1
he 1
slept 1
like 1
a 1
log 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
the 1
raven 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
approaching 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
her 1
coachman 1
and 1
everything 1
about 1
her 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
her 1
horses 1
were 1
black 1
she 1
was 1
sadder 1
than 1
ever 1
as 1
she 1
drove 1
along 1
and 1
said 1
mournfully 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
she 1
found 1
him 1
sleeping 1
heavily 1
and 1
all 1
her 1
efforts 1
to 1
awaken 1
him 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
then 1
she 1
placed 1
beside 1
him 1
a 1
loaf 1
and 1
some 1
meat 1
and 1
a 1
flask 1
of 1
wine 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
kind 1
that 1
however 1
much 1
he 1
took 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
grow 1
less 1
after 1
that 1
she 1
drew 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
on 1
which 1
her 1
name 1
was 1
engraved 1
off 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
finally 1
she 1
laid 1
a 1
letter 1
near 1
him 1
in 1
which 1
after 1
giving 1
him 1
particulars 1
of 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
finished 1
with 1
the 1
following 1
words 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
remain 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
if 1
however 1
you 1
still 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
this 1
is 1
well 1
within 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
accomplish 1
she 1
then 1
returned 1
to 1
her 1
carriage 1
and 1
drove 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
he 1
was 1
grieved 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
has 1
no 1
doubt 1
been 1
here 1
and 1
driven 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
too 1
late 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
then 1
his 1
eyes 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
were 1
lying 1
beside 1
him 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
knew 1
from 1
it 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
he 1
rose 1
up 1
without 1
delay 1
eager 1
to 1
start 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
in 1
which 1
direction 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
go 1
he 1
travelled 1
about 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
a 1
dark 1
forest 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
walking 1
for 1
fourteen 1
days 1
and 1
still 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
out 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
and 1
worn 1
out 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
pursued 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
that 1
evening 1
thinking 1
to 1
rest 1
again 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
he 1
heard 1
such 1
a 1
howling 1
and 1
wailing 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
to 1
sleep 1
he 1
waited 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
darker 1
and 1
people 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
light 1
up 1
their 1
houses 1
and 1
then 1
seeing 1
a 1
little 1
glimmer 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
it 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
house 1
which 1
looked 1
smaller 1
than 1
it 1
really 1
was 1
from 1
the 1
contrast 1
of 1
its 1
height 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
immense 1
giant 1
who 1
stood 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
the 1
giant 1
sees 1
me 1
going 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
worth 1
much 1
however 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
summoned 1
up 1
courage 1
and 1
went 1
forward 1
when 1
the 1
giant 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
it 1
is 1
lucky 1
for 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
had 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
can 1
have 1
you 1
now 1
for 1
my 1
supper 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
you 1
let 1
that 1
alone 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
for 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
willingly 1
give 1
myself 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
eaten 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
wanting 1
food 1
i 1
have 1
enough 1
to 1
satisfy 1
your 1
hunger 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
replied 1
the 1
giant 1
i 1
will 1
leave 1
you 1
in 1
peace 1
i 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
eating 1
you 1
because 1
i 1
had 1
nothing 1
else 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
indoors 1
together 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
bread 1
meat 1
and 1
wine 1
which 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drunk 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
still 1
unconsumed 1
the 1
giant 1
was 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
good 1
cheer 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
to 1
his 1
hearts 1
content 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
his 1
supper 1
the 1
man 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
direct 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
the 1
giant 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
look 1
on 1
my 1
map 1
on 1
it 1
are 1
marked 1
all 1
the 1
towns 1
villages 1
and 1
houses 1
so 1
he 1
fetched 1
his 1
map 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
never 1
mind 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
larger 1
maps 1
upstairs 1
in 1
the 1
cupboard 1
we 1
will 1
look 1
on 1
those 1
but 1
they 1
searched 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
not 1
marked 1
even 1
on 1
these 1
the 1
man 1
now 1
thought 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
continue 1
his 1
journey 1
but 1
the 1
giant 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
longer 1
until 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
his 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
away 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
provisions 1
when 1
the 1
brother 1
came 1
home 1
they 1
asked 1
him 1
about 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
maps 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
appeased 1
his 1
hunger 1
accordingly 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
his 1
supper 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
up 1
together 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
through 1
his 1
maps 1
but 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
then 1
he 1
fetched 1
other 1
older 1
maps 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
found 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
many 1
thousand 1
miles 1
away 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
asked 1
the 1
man 1
i 1
have 1
two 1
hours 1
to 1
spare 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
carry 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
i 1
must 1
then 1
return 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
our 1
care 1
the 1
giant 1
thereupon 1
carried 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
within 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
leagues 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
he 1
left 1
him 1
saying 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
walk 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
yourself 1
the 1
man 1
journeyed 1
on 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
stromberg 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
situated 1
however 1
on 1
a 1
glass 1
mountain 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
enchanted 1
maiden 1
drive 1
round 1
her 1
castle 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
inside 1
he 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
longed 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
but 1
the 1
sides 1
were 1
so 1
slippery 1
that 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
attempted 1
to 1
climb 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
reach 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
greatly 1
grieved 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
will 1
remain 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
her 1
so 1
he 1
built 1
himself 1
a 1
little 1
hut 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
and 1
watched 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
driving 1
round 1
her 1
castle 1
but 1
still 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
nearer 1
to 1
her 1
looking 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
hut 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
robbers 1
fighting 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
god 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
they 1
stopped 1
when 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
call 1
but 1
looking 1
round 1
and 1
seeing 1
nobody 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
again 1
with 1
their 1
fighting 1
which 1
now 1
became 1
more 1
furious 1
god 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
cried 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
they 1
paused 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
but 1
seeing 1
no 1
one 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
fighting 1
a 1
third 1
time 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
god 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
thinking 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
dispute 1
between 1
the 1
three 1
men 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
asked 1
them 1
why 1
they 1
were 1
fighting 1
so 1
angrily 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
to 1
strike 1
it 1
against 1
any 1
door 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
pass 1
and 1
it 1
immediately 1
flew 1
open 1
another 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
cloak 1
which 1
rendered 1
its 1
wearer 1
invisible 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
horse 1
which 1
would 1
carry 1
its 1
rider 1
over 1
any 1
obstacle 1
and 1
even 1
up 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
decide 1
whether 1
they 1
would 1
keep 1
together 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
things 1
in 1
common 1
or 1
whether 1
they 1
would 1
separate 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
something 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
those 1
three 1
things 1
not 1
money 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
but 1
something 1
that 1
is 1
of 1
far 1
more 1
value 1
i 1
must 1
first 1
however 1
prove 1
whether 1
all 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
your 1
three 1
things 1
is 1
true 1
the 1
robbers 1
therefore 1
made 1
him 1
get 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
handed 1
him 1
the 1
stick 1
and 1
the 1
cloak 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
this 1
round 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
visible 1
then 1
he 1
fell 1
upon 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
stick 1
and 1
beat 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
crying 1
there 1
you 1
idle 1
vagabonds 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
what 1
you 1
deserve 1
are 1
you 1
satisfied 1
now 1
after 1
this 1
he 1
rode 1
up 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
closed 1
but 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
blow 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
and 1
it 1
flew 1
wide 1
open 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
he 1
mounted 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
maiden 1
was 1
sitting 1
with 1
a 1
golden 1
goblet 1
full 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
still 1
wore 1
his 1
cloak 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
off 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
goblet 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
rang 1
as 1
it 1
touched 1
the 1
bottom 1
that 1
is 1
my 1
own 1
ring 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
and 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
must 1
also 1
be 1
here 1
who 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
she 1
sought 1
for 1
him 1
about 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
could 1
find 1
him 1
nowhere 1
meanwhile 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
outside 1
again 1
and 1
mounted 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
thrown 1
off 1
the 1
cloak 1
when 1
therefore 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
she 1
saw 1
him 1
and 1
cried 1
aloud 1
for 1
joy 1
then 1
he 1
dismounted 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
she 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
indeed 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
and 1
tomorrow 1
we 1
will 1
celebrate 1
our 1
marriage 1
the 1
golden 1
goose 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
sons 1
the 1
youngest 1
of 1
whom 1
was 1
called 1
dummling 1
and 1
was 1
despised 1
mocked 1
and 1
sneered 1
at 1
on 1
every 1
occasion 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
eldest 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
hew 1
wood 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
beautiful 1
sweet 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
suffer 1
from 1
hunger 1
or 1
thirst 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
forest 1
he 1
met 1
a 1
little 1
greyhaired 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
bade 1
him 1
good 1
day 1
and 1
said 1
do 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
pocket 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
your 1
wine 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
but 1
the 1
clever 1
son 1
answered 1
if 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
cake 1
and 1
wine 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
none 1
for 1
myself 1
be 1
off 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
standing 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
hew 1
down 1
a 1
tree 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
false 1
stroke 1
and 1
the 1
axe 1
cut 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
arm 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
bound 1
up 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
mans 1
doing 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
like 1
the 1
eldest 1
a 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
grey 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
likewise 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
drink 1
of 1
wine 1
but 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
too 1
said 1
sensibly 1
enough 1
what 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
away 1
from 1
myself 1
be 1
off 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
standing 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
his 1
punishment 1
however 1
was 1
not 1
delayed 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
blows 1
at 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
struck 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
home 1
then 1
dummling 1
said 1
father 1
do 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
cut 1
wood 1
the 1
father 1
answered 1
your 1
brothers 1
have 1
hurt 1
themselves 1
with 1
it 1
leave 1
it 1
alone 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
dummling 1
begged 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
just 1
go 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
wiser 1
by 1
hurting 1
yourself 1
his 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
cake 1
made 1
with 1
water 1
and 1
baked 1
in 1
the 1
cinders 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
sour 1
beer 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
grey 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
likewise 1
and 1
greeting 1
him 1
said 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
your 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
drink 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
bottle 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
dummling 1
answered 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
cindercake 1
and 1
sour 1
beer 1
if 1
that 1
pleases 1
you 1
we 1
will 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
when 1
dummling 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
cindercake 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
sweet 1
cake 1
and 1
the 1
sour 1
beer 1
had 1
become 1
good 1
wine 1
so 1
they 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
said 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
heart 1
and 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
divide 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
luck 1
there 1
stands 1
an 1
old 1
tree 1
cut 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
something 1
at 1
the 1
roots 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
him 1
dummling 1
went 1
and 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
goose 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
roots 1
with 1
feathers 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
he 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
taking 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
went 1
to 1
an 1
inn 1
where 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
the 1
night 1
now 1
the 1
host 1
had 1
three 1
daughters 1
who 1
saw 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
were 1
curious 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
such 1
a 1
wonderful 1
bird 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
golden 1
feathers 1
the 1
eldest 1
thought 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
find 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
pulling 1
out 1
a 1
feather 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
dummling 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
goose 1
by 1
the 1
wing 1
but 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
hand 1
remained 1
sticking 1
fast 1
to 1
it 1
the 1
second 1
came 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
thinking 1
only 1
of 1
how 1
she 1
might 1
get 1
a 1
feather 1
for 1
herself 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
scarcely 1
touched 1
her 1
sister 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
held 1
fast 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
third 1
also 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
like 1
intent 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
screamed 1
out 1
keep 1
away 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
keep 1
away 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
why 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
away 1
the 1
others 1
are 1
there 1
she 1
thought 1
i 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
ran 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
touched 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
remained 1
sticking 1
fast 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
the 1
goose 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
dummling 1
took 1
the 1
goose 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
without 1
troubling 1
himself 1
about 1
the 1
three 1
girls 1
who 1
were 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
it 1
they 1
were 1
obliged 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
him 1
continually 1
now 1
left 1
now 1
right 1
wherever 1
his 1
legs 1
took 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
parson 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
procession 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
shame 1
you 1
goodfornothing 1
girls 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
running 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
after 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
is 1
that 1
seemly 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
seized 1
the 1
youngest 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
pull 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
touched 1
her 1
he 1
likewise 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
was 1
himself 1
obliged 1
to 1
run 1
behind 1
before 1
long 1
the 1
sexton 1
came 1
by 1
and 1
saw 1
his 1
master 1
the 1
parson 1
running 1
behind 1
three 1
girls 1
he 1
was 1
astonished 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
called 1
out 1
hi 1
your 1
reverence 1
whither 1
away 1
so 1
quickly 1
do 1
not 1
forget 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
christening 1
today 1
and 1
running 1
after 1
him 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
sleeve 1
but 1
was 1
also 1
held 1
fast 1
to 1
it 1
whilst 1
the 1
five 1
were 1
trotting 1
thus 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
labourers 1
came 1
with 1
their 1
hoes 1
from 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
parson 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
begged 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
set 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
sexton 1
free 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
scarcely 1
touched 1
the 1
sexton 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
held 1
fast 1
and 1
now 1
there 1
were 1
seven 1
of 1
them 1
running 1
behind 1
dummling 1
and 1
the 1
goose 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
city 1
where 1
a 1
king 1
ruled 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
serious 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
make 1
her 1
laugh 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
forth 1
a 1
decree 1
that 1
whosoever 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
laugh 1
should 1
marry 1
her 1
when 1
dummling 1
heard 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
his 1
goose 1
and 1
all 1
her 1
train 1
before 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
seven 1
people 1
running 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
laugh 1
quite 1
loudly 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
stop 1
thereupon 1
dummling 1
asked 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
soninlaw 1
and 1
made 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
excuses 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
must 1
first 1
produce 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
drink 1
a 1
cellarful 1
of 1
wine 1
dummling 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
certainly 1
help 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
felled 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
man 1
sitting 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
face 1
dummling 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
taking 1
to 1
heart 1
so 1
sorely 1
and 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
thirst 1
and 1
cannot 1
quench 1
it 1
cold 1
water 1
i 1
cannot 1
stand 1
a 1
barrel 1
of 1
wine 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
emptied 1
but 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
drop 1
on 1
a 1
hot 1
stone 1
there 1
i 1
can 1
help 1
you 1
said 1
dummling 1
just 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
satisfied 1
he 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
kings 1
cellar 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
huge 1
barrels 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
drank 1
till 1
his 1
loins 1
hurt 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
out 1
he 1
had 1
emptied 1
all 1
the 1
barrels 1
then 1
dummling 1
asked 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
vexed 1
that 1
such 1
an 1
ugly 1
fellow 1
whom 1
everyone 1
called 1
dummling 1
should 1
take 1
away 1
his 1
daughter 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
new 1
condition 1
he 1
must 1
first 1
find 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
eat 1
a 1
whole 1
mountain 1
of 1
bread 1
dummling 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
long 1
but 1
went 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
tying 1
up 1
his 1
body 1
with 1
a 1
strap 1
and 1
making 1
an 1
awful 1
face 1
and 1
saying 1
i 1
have 1
eaten 1
a 1
whole 1
ovenful 1
of 1
rolls 1
but 1
what 1
good 1
is 1
that 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
such 1
a 1
hunger 1
as 1
i 1
my 1
stomach 1
remains 1
empty 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
tie 1
myself 1
up 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
to 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
at 1
this 1
dummling 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
said 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
you 1
shall 1
eat 1
yourself 1
full 1
he 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
palace 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
flour 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
kingdom 1
was 1
collected 1
and 1
from 1
it 1
he 1
caused 1
a 1
huge 1
mountain 1
of 1
bread 1
to 1
be 1
baked 1
the 1
man 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
stood 1
before 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
whole 1
mountain 1
had 1
vanished 1
then 1
dummling 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
again 1
sought 1
a 1
way 1
out 1
and 1
ordered 1
a 1
ship 1
which 1
could 1
sail 1
on 1
land 1
and 1
on 1
water 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
come 1
sailing 1
back 1
in 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
my 1
daughter 1
for 1
wife 1
dummling 1
went 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
cake 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
what 1
dummling 1
wanted 1
he 1
said 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
to 1
drink 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
because 1
you 1
once 1
were 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
ship 1
which 1
could 1
sail 1
on 1
land 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
prevent 1
him 1
from 1
having 1
his 1
daughter 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
kings 1
death 1
dummling 1
inherited 1
his 1
kingdom 1
and 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
contentedly 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
simpleton 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
long 1
before 1
you 1
or 1
i 1
were 1
born 1
there 1
reigned 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
sons 1
this 1
king 1
once 1
fell 1
very 1
illso 1
ill 1
that 1
nobody 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
live 1
his 1
sons 1
were 1
very 1
much 1
grieved 1
at 1
their 1
fathers 1
sickness 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
walking 1
together 1
very 1
mournfully 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
they 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
their 1
father 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
nothing 1
could 1
save 1
him 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
would 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
get 1
then 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
king 1
and 1
begged 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
could 1
save 1
him 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
place 1
you 1
in 1
such 1
great 1
danger 1
as 1
you 1
must 1
meet 1
with 1
in 1
your 1
journey 1
but 1
he 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
i 1
bring 1
my 1
father 1
this 1
water 1
he 1
will 1
make 1
me 1
sole 1
heir 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
then 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
deep 1
valley 1
overhung 1
with 1
rocks 1
and 1
woods 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
he 1
saw 1
standing 1
above 1
him 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
a 1
little 1
ugly 1
dwarf 1
with 1
a 1
sugarloaf 1
cap 1
and 1
a 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
thee 1
you 1
ugly 1
imp 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
haughtily 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
was 1
enraged 1
at 1
his 1
behaviour 1
and 1
laid 1
a 1
fairy 1
spell 1
of 1
illluck 1
upon 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
mountain 1
pass 1
became 1
narrower 1
and 1
narrower 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
way 1
was 1
so 1
straitened 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
have 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
go 1
back 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
loud 1
laugh 1
ringing 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
path 1
was 1
closed 1
behind 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
shut 1
in 1
all 1
round 1
he 1
next 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
off 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
on 1
foot 1
but 1
again 1
the 1
laugh 1
rang 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
unable 1
to 1
move 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
abide 1
spellbound 1
meantime 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
lingering 1
on 1
in 1
daily 1
hope 1
of 1
his 1
sons 1
return 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
said 1
father 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
for 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
my 1
brother 1
is 1
surely 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
kingdom 1
will 1
fall 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
find 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
very 1
unwilling 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
yielded 1
to 1
his 1
wish 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
same 1
road 1
which 1
his 1
brother 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
met 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
elf 1
who 1
stopped 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
in 1
the 1
mountains 1
saying 1
as 1
before 1
prince 1
prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
mind 1
your 1
own 1
affairs 1
busybody 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
scornfully 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
put 1
the 1
same 1
spell 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
and 1
he 1
too 1
was 1
at 1
last 1
obliged 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
his 1
abode 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
thus 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
proud 1
silly 1
people 1
who 1
think 1
themselves 1
above 1
everyone 1
else 1
and 1
are 1
too 1
proud 1
to 1
ask 1
or 1
take 1
advice 1
when 1
the 1
second 1
prince 1
had 1
thus 1
been 1
gone 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
trusted 1
he 1
should 1
soon 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
father 1
well 1
again 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
met 1
him 1
too 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
in 1
the 1
valley 1
among 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
said 1
prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
because 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
ill 1
and 1
like 1
to 1
die 1
