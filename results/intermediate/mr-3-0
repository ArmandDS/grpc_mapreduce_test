a 1
certain 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
beautiful 1
garden 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
stood 1
a 1
tree 1
which 1
bore 1
golden 1
apples 1
these 1
apples 1
were 1
always 1
counted 1
and 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
ripe 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
that 1
every 1
night 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
king 1
became 1
very 1
angry 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
ordered 1
the 1
gardener 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
all 1
night 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
the 1
gardener 1
set 1
his 1
eldest 1
son 1
to 1
watch 1
but 1
about 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
he 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
was 1
missing 1
then 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
was 1
ordered 1
to 1
watch 1
and 1
at 1
midnight 1
he 1
too 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
another 1
apple 1
was 1
gone 1
then 1
the 1
third 1
son 1
offered 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
but 1
the 1
gardener 1
at 1
first 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
for 1
fear 1
some 1
harm 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
however 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
consented 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
laid 1
himself 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
watch 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
twelve 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
rustling 1
noise 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
a 1
bird 1
came 1
flying 1
that 1
was 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
snapping 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
with 1
its 1
beak 1
the 1
gardeners 1
son 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
at 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
arrow 1
did 1
the 1
bird 1
no 1
harm 1
only 1
it 1
dropped 1
a 1
golden 1
feather 1
from 1
its 1
tail 1
and 1
then 1
flew 1
away 1
the 1
golden 1
feather 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
council 1
was 1
called 1
together 1
everyone 1
agreed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
wealth 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
one 1
feather 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
the 1
whole 1
bird 1
then 1
the 1
gardeners 1
eldest 1
son 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
very 1
easily 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
fox 1
sitting 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
made 1
ready 1
to 1
shoot 1
at 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
shoot 1
me 1
for 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
counsel 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
your 1
business 1
is 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
you 1
will 1
reach 1
a 1
village 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
two 1
inns 1
opposite 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
is 1
very 1
pleasant 1
and 1
beautiful 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
go 1
not 1
in 1
there 1
but 1
rest 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
though 1
it 1
may 1
appear 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
poor 1
and 1
mean 1
but 1
the 1
son 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
what 1
can 1
such 1
a 1
beast 1
as 1
this 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
so 1
he 1
shot 1
his 1
arrow 1
at 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
he 1
missed 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
set 1
up 1
its 1
tail 1
above 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
the 1
two 1
inns 1
were 1
and 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
were 1
people 1
singing 1
and 1
dancing 1
and 1
feasting 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
looked 1
very 1
dirty 1
and 1
poor 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
silly 1
said 1
he 1
if 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
that 1
shabby 1
house 1
and 1
left 1
this 1
charming 1
place 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
smart 1
house 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
at 1
his 1
ease 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
his 1
country 1
too 1
time 1
passed 1
on 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
no 1
tidings 1
were 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
who 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
good 1
advice 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
inns 1
his 1
eldest 1
brother 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
where 1
the 1
merrymaking 1
was 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
withstand 1
the 1
temptation 1
but 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
and 1
his 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
time 1
passed 1
on 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
too 1
wished 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
some 1
ill 1
luck 1
might 1
happen 1
to 1
him 1
also 1
and 1
prevent 1
his 1
coming 1
back 1
however 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
he 1
should 1
go 1
for 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
rest 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
he 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
counsel 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
thankful 1
to 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
attempt 1
his 1
life 1
as 1
his 1
brothers 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
sit 1
upon 1
my 1
tail 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
travel 1
faster 1
so 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
so 1
quick 1
that 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
son 1
followed 1
the 1
foxs 1
counsel 1
and 1
without 1
looking 1
about 1
him 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
shabby 1
inn 1
and 1
rested 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
at 1
his 1
ease 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
came 1
the 1
fox 1
again 1
and 1
met 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
beginning 1
his 1
journey 1
and 1
said 1
go 1
straight 1
forward 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
castle 1
before 1
which 1
lie 1
a 1
whole 1
troop 1
of 1
soldiers 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
pass 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
sits 1
in 1
a 1
wooden 1
cage 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
stands 1
a 1
beautiful 1
golden 1
cage 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
try 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
bird 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
shabby 1
cage 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
handsome 1
one 1
otherwise 1
you 1
will 1
repent 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
tail 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
before 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
all 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
had 1
said 1
so 1
the 1
son 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
chamber 1
where 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
hung 1
in 1
a 1
wooden 1
cage 1
and 1
below 1
stood 1
the 1
golden 1
cage 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
were 1
lying 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
then 1
thought 1
he 1
to 1
himself 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
droll 1
thing 1
to 1
bring 1
away 1
such 1
a 1
fine 1
bird 1
in 1
this 1
shabby 1
cage 1
so 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
golden 1
cage 1
but 1
the 1
bird 1
set 1
up 1
such 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
soldiers 1
awoke 1
and 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
prisoner 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
court 1
sat 1
to 1
judge 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
heard 1
it 1
sentenced 1
him 1
to 1
die 1
unless 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
which 1
could 1
run 1
as 1
swiftly 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
given 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
once 1
more 1
on 1
his 1
journey 1
sighing 1
and 1
in 1
great 1
despair 1
when 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
see 1
now 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
your 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
counsel 1
i 1
will 1
still 1
however 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
as 1
i 1
bid 1
you 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
straight 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
the 1
horse 1
stands 1
in 1
his 1
stall 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
will 1
lie 1
the 1
groom 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
take 1
away 1
the 1
horse 1
quietly 1
but 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
old 1
leathern 1
saddle 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
golden 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
son 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
foxs 1
tail 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
all 1
went 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
groom 1
lay 1
snoring 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
golden 1
saddle 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
son 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
horse 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
a 1
great 1
pity 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
leathern 1
saddle 1
upon 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
good 1
one 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
he 1
deserves 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
golden 1
saddle 1
the 1
groom 1
awoke 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
guards 1
ran 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
prisoner 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
again 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
court 1
to 1
be 1
judged 1
and 1
was 1
sentenced 1
to 1
die 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
bring 1
thither 1
the 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
given 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
why 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
carried 1
away 1
both 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
yet 1
will 1
i 1
once 1
more 1
give 1
you 1
counsel 1
go 1
straight 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
you 1
will 1
arrive 1
at 1
a 1
castle 1
at 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
bathinghouse 1
go 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
give 1
her 1
a 1
kiss 1
and 1
she 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
lead 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
suffer 1
her 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
so 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
again 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
all 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
at 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
met 1
the 1
princess 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
bath 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
the 1
kiss 1
and 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
but 1
begged 1
with 1
many 1
tears 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
her 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
refused 1
but 1
she 1
wept 1
still 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
fell 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
consented 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
fathers 1
house 1
the 1
guards 1
awoke 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
prisoner 1
again 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
have 1
my 1
daughter 1
unless 1
in 1
eight 1
days 1
you 1
dig 1
away 1
the 1
hill 1
that 1
stops 1
the 1
view 1
from 1
my 1
window 1
now 1
this 1
hill 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
worked 1
for 1
seven 1
days 1
and 1
had 1
done 1
very 1
little 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
lie 1
down 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
i 1
will 1
work 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
the 1
hill 1
was 1
gone 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
merrily 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
removed 1
he 1
must 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
princess 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
away 1
went 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
we 1
will 1
have 1
all 1
three 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
thing 1
but 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
contrive 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
listen 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
done 1
when 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
for 1
the 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
you 1
must 1
say 1
here 1
she 1
is 1
then 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
very 1
joyful 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
mount 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
and 1
put 1
out 1
your 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
last 1
then 1
lift 1
her 1
quickly 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
behind 1
you 1
clap 1
your 1
spurs 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
and 1
gallop 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
all 1
went 1
right 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
when 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
the 1
bird 1
is 1
i 1
will 1
stay 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
ride 1
in 1
and 1
speak 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
horse 1
he 1
will 1
bring 1
out 1
the 1
bird 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
sit 1
still 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
golden 1
bird 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
it 1
into 1
your 1
hand 1
ride 1
away 1
this 1
too 1
happened 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
they 1
carried 1
off 1
the 1
bird 1
the 1
princess 1
mounted 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
rode 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
wood 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
pray 1
kill 1
me 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
my 1
feet 1
but 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
refused 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
counsel 1
beware 1
of 1
two 1
things 1
ransom 1
no 1
one 1
from 1
the 1
gallows 1
and 1
sit 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
no 1
river 1
then 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
well 1
thought 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
hard 1
matter 1
to 1
keep 1
that 1
advice 1
he 1
rode 1
on 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
two 1
brothers 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
and 1
uproar 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
people 1
said 1
two 1
men 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
hanged 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
nearer 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
were 1
his 1
brothers 1
who 1
had 1
turned 1
robbers 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
cannot 1
they 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
be 1
saved 1
but 1
the 1
people 1
said 1
no 1
unless 1
he 1
would 1
bestow 1
all 1
his 1
money 1
upon 1
the 1
rascals 1
and 1
buy 1
their 1
liberty 1
then 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
stay 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
paid 1
what 1
was 1
asked 1
and 1
his 1
brothers 1
were 1
given 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
him 1
towards 1
their 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
where 1
the 1
fox 1
first 1
met 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
cool 1
and 1
pleasant 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
said 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
yes 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
foxs 1
counsel 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
suspected 1
nothing 1
they 1
came 1
behind 1
and 1
threw 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
their 1
master 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
this 1
have 1
we 1
won 1
by 1
our 1
labour 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
rejoicing 1
made 1
but 1
the 1
horse 1
would 1
not 1
eat 1
the 1
bird 1
would 1
not 1
sing 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
wept 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
rivers 1
bed 1
luckily 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
dry 1
but 1
his 1
bones 1
were 1
almost 1
broken 1
and 1
the 1
bank 1
was 1
so 1
steep 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
scolded 1
him 1
for 1
not 1
following 1
his 1
advice 1
otherwise 1
no 1
evil 1
would 1
have 1
befallen 1
him 1
yet 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
cannot 1
leave 1
you 1
here 1
so 1
lay 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
tail 1
and 1
hold 1
fast 1
then 1
he 1
pulled 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
your 1
brothers 1
have 1
set 1
watch 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
if 1
they 1
find 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
so 1
he 1
dressed 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
and 1
came 1
secretly 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
court 1
and 1
was 1
scarcely 1
within 1
the 1
doors 1
when 1
the 1
horse 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
to 1
sing 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
left 1
off 1
weeping 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
brothers 1
roguery 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
seized 1
and 1
punished 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
princess 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
kings 1
death 1
he 1
was 1
heir 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
after 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
besought 1
him 1
with 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
feet 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
fox 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
many 1
years 1
hans 1
in 1
luck 1
some 1
men 1
are 1
born 1
to 1
good 1
luck 1
all 1
they 1
do 1
or 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
comes 1
rightall 1
that 1
falls 1
to 1
them 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
gainall 1
their 1
geese 1
are 1
swansall 1
their 1
cards 1
are 1
trumpstoss 1
them 1
which 1
way 1
you 1
will 1
they 1
will 1
always 1
like 1
poor 1
puss 1
alight 1
upon 1
their 1
legs 1
and 1
only 1
move 1
on 1
so 1
much 1
the 1
faster 1
the 1
world 1
may 1
very 1
likely 1
not 1
always 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
they 1
think 1
of 1
themselves 1
but 1
what 1
care 1
they 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
lucky 1
beings 1
was 1
neighbour 1
hans 1
seven 1
long 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
his 1
master 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
master 1
my 1
time 1
is 1
up 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
poor 1
mother 1
once 1
more 1
so 1
pray 1
pay 1
me 1
my 1
wages 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
faithful 1
and 1
good 1
servant 1
hans 1
so 1
your 1
pay 1
shall 1
be 1
handsome 1
then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
silver 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
his 1
head 1
hans 1
took 1
out 1
his 1
pockethandkerchief 1
put 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
silver 1
into 1
it 1
threw 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
jogged 1
off 1
on 1
his 1
road 1
homewards 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
lazily 1
on 1
dragging 1
one 1
foot 1
after 1
another 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
trotting 1
gaily 1
along 1
on 1
a 1
capital 1
horse 1
ah 1
said 1
hans 1
aloud 1
what 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
ride 1
on 1
horseback 1
there 1
he 1
sits 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
by 1
his 1
fireside 1
he 1
trips 1
against 1
no 1
stones 1
saves 1
shoeleather 1
and 1
gets 1
on 1
he 1
hardly 1
knows 1
how 1
hans 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
so 1
softly 1
but 1
the 1
horseman 1
heard 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
said 1
well 1
friend 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
go 1
on 1
foot 1
then 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
this 1
load 1
to 1
carry 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
it 1
is 1
silver 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
heavy 1
that 1
i 1
cant 1
hold 1
up 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
it 1
hurts 1
my 1
shoulder 1
sadly 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
of 1
making 1
an 1
exchange 1
said 1
the 1
horseman 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
horse 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
silver 1
which 1
will 1
save 1
you 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
trouble 1
in 1
carrying 1
such 1
a 1
heavy 1
load 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
hans 1
but 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
tell 1
you 1
one 1
thingyou 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
weary 1
task 1
to 1
draw 1
that 1
silver 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
the 1
horseman 1
got 1
off 1
took 1
the 1
silver 1
helped 1
hans 1
up 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
bridle 1
into 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
whip 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
said 1
when 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
very 1
fast 1
smack 1
your 1
lips 1
loudly 1
together 1
and 1
cry 1
jip 1
hans 1
was 1
delighted 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
squared 1
his 1
elbows 1
turned 1
out 1
his 1
toes 1
cracked 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
rode 1
merrily 1
off 1
one 1
minute 1
whistling 1
a 1
merry 1
tune 1
and 1
another 1
singing 1
no 1
care 1
and 1
no 1
sorrow 1
a 1
fig 1
for 1
the 1
morrow 1
well 1
laugh 1
and 1
be 1
merry 1
sing 1
neigh 1
down 1
derry 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
so 1
he 1
smacked 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
cried 1
jip 1
away 1
went 1
the 1
horse 1
full 1
gallop 1
and 1
before 1
hans 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
thrown 1
off 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
roadside 1
his 1
horse 1
would 1
have 1
ran 1
off 1
if 1
a 1
shepherd 1
who 1
was 1
coming 1
by 1
driving 1
a 1
cow 1
had 1
not 1
stopped 1
it 1
hans 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
legs 1
again 1
sadly 1
vexed 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
shepherd 1
this 1
riding 1
is 1
no 1
joke 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
the 1
luck 1
to 1
get 1
upon 1
a 1
beast 1
like 1
this 1
that 1
stumbles 1
and 1
flings 1
him 1
off 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
break 1
his 1
neck 1
however 1
im 1
off 1
now 1
once 1
for 1
all 1
i 1
like 1
your 1
cow 1
now 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
smart 1
beast 1
that 1
played 1
me 1
this 1
trick 1
and 1
has 1
spoiled 1
my 1
best 1
coat 1
you 1
see 1
in 1
this 1
puddle 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
by 1
smells 1
not 1
very 1
like 1
a 1
nosegay 1
one 1
can 1
walk 1
along 1
at 1
ones 1
leisure 1
behind 1
that 1
cowkeep 1
good 1
company 1
and 1
have 1
milk 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
every 1
day 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
what 1
would 1
i 1
give 1
to 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
prize 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
shepherd 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
i 1
will 1
change 1
my 1
cow 1
for 1
your 1
horse 1
i 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
good 1
to 1
my 1
neighbours 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
lose 1
by 1
it 1
myself 1
done 1
said 1
hans 1
merrily 1
what 1
a 1
noble 1
heart 1
that 1
good 1
man 1
has 1
thought 1
he 1
then 1
the 1
shepherd 1
jumped 1
upon 1
the 1
horse 1
wished 1
hans 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
good 1
morning 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
rode 1
hans 1
brushed 1
his 1
coat 1
wiped 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
rested 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
off 1
his 1
cow 1
quietly 1
and 1
thought 1
his 1
bargain 1
a 1
very 1
lucky 1
one 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
i 1
certainly 1
shall 1
always 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
whenever 1
i 1
like 1
eat 1
my 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
thirsty 1
i 1
can 1
milk 1
my 1
cow 1
and 1
drink 1
the 1
milk 1
and 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
wish 1
for 1
more 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
inn 1
he 1
halted 1
ate 1
up 1
all 1
his 1
bread 1
and 1
gave 1
away 1
his 1
last 1
penny 1
for 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
beer 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
rested 1
himself 1
he 1
set 1
off 1
again 1
driving 1
his 1
cow 1
towards 1
his 1
mothers 1
village 1
but 1
the 1
heat 1
grew 1
greater 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
noon 1
came 1
on 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
on 1
a 1
wide 1
heath 1
that 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
cross 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
hot 1
and 1
parched 1
that 1
his 1
tongue 1
clave 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
i 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
cure 1
for 1
this 1
thought 1
he 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
milk 1
my 1
cow 1
and 1
quench 1
my 1
thirst 1
so 1
he 1
tied 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
leathern 1
cap 1
to 1
milk 1
into 1
but 1
not 1
a 1
drop 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
had 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
cow 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
milk 1
and 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
utterly 1
dry 1
hans 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
of 1
looking 1
to 1
that 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
his 1
luck 1
in 1
milking 1
and 1
managing 1
the 1
matter 1
very 1
clumsily 1
the 1
uneasy 1
beast 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
him 1
very 1
troublesome 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
gave 1
him 1
such 1
a 1
kick 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
as 1
knocked 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
lay 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
senseless 1
luckily 1
a 1
butcher 1
soon 1
came 1
by 1
driving 1
a 1
pig 1
in 1
a 1
wheelbarrow 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
my 1
man 1
said 1
the 1
butcher 1
as 1
he 1
helped 1
him 1
up 1
hans 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
milk 1
his 1
cow 1
but 1
found 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
dry 1
too 1
then 1
the 1
butcher 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
flask 1
of 1
ale 1
saying 1
there 1
drink 1
and 1
refresh 1
yourself 1
your 1
cow 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
no 1
milk 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
she 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
beast 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
slaughterhouse 1
alas 1
alas 1
said 1
hans 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
it 1
what 1
a 1
shame 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
horse 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
only 1
a 1
dry 1
cow 1
if 1
i 1
kill 1
her 1
what 1
will 1
she 1
be 1
good 1
for 1
i 1
hate 1
cowbeef 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
tender 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
pig 1
nowlike 1
that 1
fat 1
gentleman 1
you 1
are 1
driving 1
along 1
at 1
his 1
easeone 1
could 1
do 1
something 1
with 1
it 1
it 1
would 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
make 1
sausages 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
butcher 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
to 1
say 1
no 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
asked 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
kind 1
neighbourly 1
thing 1
to 1
please 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
change 1
and 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
fine 1
fat 1
pig 1
for 1
the 1
cow 1
heaven 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
and 1
selfdenial 1
said 1
hans 1
as 1
he 1
gave 1
the 1
butcher 1
the 1
cow 1
and 1
taking 1
the 1
pig 1
off 1
the 1
wheelbarrow 1
drove 1
it 1
away 1
holding 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
string 1
that 1
was 1
tied 1
to 1
its 1
leg 1
so 1
on 1
he 1
jogged 1
and 1
all 1
seemed 1
now 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
with 1
some 1
misfortunes 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
well 1
repaid 1
for 1
all 1
how 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
otherwise 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
travelling 1
companion 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
the 1
next 1
man 1
he 1
met 1
was 1
a 1
countryman 1
carrying 1
a 1
fine 1
white 1
goose 1
the 1
countryman 1
stopped 1
to 1
ask 1
what 1
was 1
oclock 1
this 1
led 1
to 1
further 1
chat 1
and 1
hans 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
luck 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
many 1
good 1
bargains 1
and 1
how 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
went 1
gay 1
and 1
smiling 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
countryman 1
then 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
goose 1
to 1
a 1
christening 1
feel 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
heavy 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
eight 1
weeks 1
old 1
whoever 1
roasts 1
and 1
eats 1
it 1
will 1
find 1
plenty 1
of 1
fat 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
has 1
lived 1
so 1
well 1
youre 1
right 1
said 1
hans 1
as 1
he 1
weighed 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
talk 1
of 1
fat 1
my 1
pig 1
is 1
no 1
trifle 1
meantime 1
the 1
countryman 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
grave 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
hark 1
ye 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
worthy 1
friend 1

seem 1
a 1
good 1
sort 1
of 1

kind 1
turn 1

scrape 1
in 1

had 1
a 1
pig 1
stolen 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
sty 1
i 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
afraid 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
that 1

got 1
the 1
squires 1
pig 1
if 1
you 1

a 1
bad 1
job 1
for 1

be 1
to 1

he 1

me 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
scrape 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
where 1
the 1
pig 1
was 1
either 1
bred 1
or 1
born 1
but 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
squires 1
for 1
aught 1

something 1
into 1

the 1
countryman 1
give 1
a 1
fat 1
goose 1
for 1
a 1
pig 1

not 1
everyone 1
would 1
do 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
you 1
as 1
that 1
however 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
hard 1
upon 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
trouble 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
string 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
drove 1
off 1
the 1
pig 1
by 1
a 1
side 1
path 1
while 1
hans 1
went 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
homewards 1
free 1
from 1
care 1
after 1
all 1
thought 1
he 1
that 1
chap 1
is 1
pretty 1
well 1
taken 1
in 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
whose 1
pig 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
wherever 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
friend 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
much 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1

then 1
the 1
fat 1

find 1
me 1
in 1
goosegrease 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
then 1

the 1
beautiful 1
white 1
feathers 1
i 1
will 1
put 1

shall 1
sleep 1
soundly 1
without 1
rocking 1
how 1
happy 1
my 1
mother 1

be 1
talk 1
of 1
a 1
pig 1

give 1
me 1
a 1
fine 1
fat 1
goose 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
village 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
scissorgrinder 1
with 1
his 1
wheel 1
working 1
and 1
singing 1
oer 1
hill 1
and 1
oer 1
dale 1
so 1
happy 1
i 1
roam 1

light 1
and 1

my 1
home 1
then 1
who 1
so 1
blythe 1
so 1
merry 1
as 1
i 1
hans 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
well 1
off 1
master 1
grinder 1
you 1
seem 1
so 1
happy 1
at 1
your 1
work 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
mine 1
is 1
a 1
golden 1
trade 1
a 1
good 1
grinder 1
never 1
puts 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
without 1
finding 1
money 1
in 1
itbut 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
that 1
beautiful 1
goose 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
buy 1
it 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
pig 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
pig 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
cow 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
horse 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
silver 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
my 1
head 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
silver 1
oh 1
i 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
that 1
seven 1
long 1
years 1
you 1
have 1
thriven 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
hitherto 1
said 1
the 1
grinder 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
find 1
money 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
whenever 1
you 1
put 1
your 1
hand 1
in 1
it 1
your 1
fortune 1
would 1
be 1
made 1
very 1
true 1
but 1
how 1
is 1

said 1
the 1
grinder 1
as 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
common 1
rough 1
stone 1
that 1
lay 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
capital 1
stone 1

enough 1

an 1
old 1
nail 1
cut 1
with 1
it 1
hans 1
took 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
heart 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
surely 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
born 1
in 1
a 1
lucky 1
hour 1
everything 1
i 1
could 1
want 1
or 1
wish 1
for 1
comes 1
of 1
itself 1
people 1
are 1
so 1
kind 1
they 1
seem 1
really 1
to 1
think 1
i 1
do 1
them 1
a 1
favour 1
in 1
letting 1
them 1
make 1
me 1
rich 1
and 1
giving 1
me 1
good 1
bargains 1
meantime 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
tired 1
and 1
hungry 1
too 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
away 1
his 1
last 1
penny 1
in 1
his 1
joy 1
at 1
getting 1
the 1
cow 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
for 1
the 1
stone 1
tired 1
him 1
sadly 1
and 1
he 1
dragged 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
a 1
drink 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
stone 1
carefully 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
he 1
forgot 1
it 1
pushed 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
down 1
it 1
rolled 1
plump 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
watched 1
it 1
sinking 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
clear 1
water 1
then 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
danced 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
again 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
thanked 1
heaven 1
with 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
its 1
kindness 1
in 1
taking 1
away 1
his 1
only 1
plague 1
the 1
ugly 1
heavy 1
stone 1
how 1
happy 1
am 1
i 1
cried 1
he 1
nobody 1
was 1
ever 1
so 1
lucky 1
as 1
i 1
then 1
up 1
he 1
got 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
heart 1
free 1
from 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
his 1
mothers 1
house 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
very 1
easy 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
good 1
luck 1
was 1
jorinda 1
and 1
jorindel 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
an 1
old 1
castle 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
gloomy 1
wood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
lived 1
an 1
old 1
fairy 1
now 1
this 1
fairy 1
could 1
take 1
any 1
shape 1
she 1
pleased 1
all 1
the 1
day 1
long 1
she 1
flew 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
an 1
owl 1
or 1
crept 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
like 1
a 1
cat 1
but 1
at 1
night 1
she 1
always 1
became 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
again 1
when 1
any 1
young 1
man 1
came 1
within 1
a 1
hundred 1
paces 1
of 1
her 1
castle 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
fixed 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
a 1
step 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
and 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
do 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
his 1
word 1
never 1
to 1
come 1
there 1
again 1
but 1
when 1
any 1
pretty 1
maiden 1
came 1
within 1
that 1
space 1
she 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
fairy 1
put 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
cage 1
and 1
hung 1
her 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
chamber 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
there 1
were 1
seven 1
hundred 1
of 1
these 1
cages 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
all 1
with 1
beautiful 1
birds 1
in 1
them 1
now 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
maiden 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
jorinda 1
she 1
was 1
prettier 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
pretty 1
girls 1
that 1
ever 1
were 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
a 1
shepherd 1
lad 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
jorindel 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
soon 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
one 1
day 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
alone 1
and 1
jorindel 1
said 1
we 1
must 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
we 1
dont 1
go 1
too 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
fairys 1
castle 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
evening 1
the 1
last 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
shone 1
bright 1
through 1
the 1
long 1
stems 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
upon 1
the 1
green 1
underwood 1
beneath 1
and 1
the 1
turtledoves 1
sang 1
from 1
the 1
tall 1
birches 1
jorinda 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
the 1
sun 1
jorindel 1
sat 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
both 1
felt 1
sad 1
they 1
knew 1
not 1
why 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
one 1
another 1
for 1
ever 1
they 1
had 1
wandered 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
way 1
they 1
should 1
go 1
home 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
path 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
setting 1
fast 1
and 1
already 1
half 1
of 1
its 1
circle 1
had 1
sunk 1
behind 1
the 1
hill 1
jorindel 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
looked 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
saw 1
through 1
the 1
bushes 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
sat 1
down 1
close 1
under 1
the 1
old 1
walls 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
then 1
he 1
shrank 1
for 1
fear 1
turned 1
pale 1
and 1
trembled 1
jorinda 1
was 1
just 1
singing 1
the 1
ringdove 1
sang 1
from 1
the 1
willow 1
spray 1
welladay 1
welladay 1
he 1
mournd 1
for 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
his 1
darling 1
mate 1
welladay 1
when 1
her 1
song 1
stopped 1
suddenly 1
jorindel 1
turned 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
reason 1
and 1
beheld 1
his 1
jorinda 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
nightingale 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
song 1
ended 1
with 1
a 1
mournful 1
_jug 1
jug_ 1
an 1
owl 1
with 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
flew 1
three 1
times 1
round 1
them 1
and 1
three 1
times 1
screamed 1
tu 1
whu 1
tu 1
whu 1
tu 1
whu 1
jorindel 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
he 1
stood 1
fixed 1
as 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
could 1
neither 1
weep 1
nor 1
speak 1
nor 1
stir 1
hand 1
or 1
foot 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
sun 1
went 1
quite 1
down 1
the 1
gloomy 1
night 1
came 1
the 1
owl 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
after 1
the 1
old 1
fairy 1
came 1
forth 1
pale 1
and 1
meagre 1
with 1
staring 1
eyes 1
and 1
a 1
nose 1
and 1
chin 1
that 1
almost 1
met 1
one 1
another 1
she 1
mumbled 1
something 1
to 1
herself 1
seized 1
the 1
nightingale 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
poor 1
jorindel 1
saw 1
the 1
nightingale 1
was 1
gonebut 1
what 1
could 1
he 1
do 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
speak 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
stood 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
fairy 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
sang 1
with 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
till 1
the 1
prisoner 1
is 1
fast 1
and 1
her 1
doom 1
is 1
cast 1
there 1
stay 1
oh 1
stay 1
when 1
the 1
charm 1
is 1
around 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
spell 1
has 1
bound 1
her 1
hie 1
away 1
away 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
jorindel 1
found 1
himself 1
free 1
then 1
he 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
before 1
the 1
fairy 1
and 1
prayed 1
her 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
back 1
his 1
dear 1
jorinda 1
but 1
she 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
should 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
again 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
he 1
prayed 1
he 1
wept 1
he 1
sorrowed 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
alas 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
home 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
strange 1
village 1
and 1
employed 1
himself 1
in 1
keeping 1
sheep 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
did 1
he 1
walk 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
as 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
hated 1
castle 1
as 1
he 1
dared 1
go 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
heard 1
or 1
saw 1
nothing 1
of 1
jorinda 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
dreamt 1
one 1
night 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
beautiful 1
purple 1
flower 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
costly 1
pearl 1
and 1
he 1
dreamt 1
that 1
he 1
plucked 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
that 1
everything 1
he 1
touched 1
with 1
it 1
was 1
disenchanted 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
jorinda 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
search 1
over 1
hill 1
and 1
dale 1
for 1
this 1
pretty 1
flower 1
and 1
eight 1
long 1
days 1
he 1
sought 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
vain 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
ninth 1
day 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
beautiful 1
purple 1
flower 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
dewdrop 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
costly 1
pearl 1
then 1
he 1
plucked 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
travelled 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
he 1
walked 1
nearer 1
than 1
a 1
hundred 1
paces 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
become 1
fixed 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
quite 1
close 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
jorindel 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
indeed 1
to 1
see 1
this 1
then 1
he 1
touched 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
it 1
sprang 1
open 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
listened 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
so 1
many 1
birds 1
singing 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
where 1
the 1
fairy 1
sat 1
with 1
the 1
seven 1
hundred 1
birds 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
seven 1
hundred 1
cages 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
jorindel 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
screamed 1
with 1
rage 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
within 1
two 1
yards 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
flower 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
his 1
safeguard 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
at 1
the 1
birds 1
but 1
alas 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
many 1
nightingales 1
and 1
how 1
then 1
should 1
he 1
find 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
his 1
jorinda 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
fairy 1
had 1
taken 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cages 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
her 1
way 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
ran 1
or 1
flew 1
after 1
her 1
touched 1
the 1
cage 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
jorinda 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
looking 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
ever 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
when 1
they 1
walked 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
then 1
he 1
touched 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
birds 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
all 1
took 1
their 1
old 1
forms 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
jorinda 1
home 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
other 1
lads 1
whose 1
maidens 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
fairys 1
cages 1
by 1
themselves 1
much 1
longer 1
than 1
they 1
liked 1
the 1
travelling 1
musicians 1
an 1
honest 1
farmer 1
had 1
once 1
an 1
ass 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
faithful 1
servant 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
but 1
was 1
now 1
growing 1
old 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
unfit 1
for 1
work 1
his 1
master 1
therefore 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
keeping 1
him 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
putting 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
ass 1
who 1
saw 1
that 1
some 1
mischief 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
took 1
himself 1
slyly 1
off 1
and 1
began 1
his 1
journey 1
towards 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
for 1
there 1
thought 1
he 1
i 1
may 1
turn 1
musician 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
travelled 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
he 1
spied 1
a 1
dog 1
lying 1
by 1
the 1
roadside 1
and 1
panting 1
as 1
if 1
he 1

he 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
they 1
jogged 1
on 1
together 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
cat 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
most 1
rueful 1
face 1

the 1
cat 1
how 1
can 1
one 1
be 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
when 1
ones 1
life 1
is 1
in 1
danger 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
beginning 1
to 1
grow 1
old 1
and 1
had 1
rather 1
lie 1
at 1
my 1
ease 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
than 1
run 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
after 1
the 1
mice 1
my 1
mistress 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drown 1
me 1
and 1
though 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
oh 1

the 1
ass 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
go 1
with 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
city 1

are 1
a 1
good 1
night 1
singer 1
and 1
may 1
make 1
your 1
fortune 1
as 1
a 1
musician 1
the 1
cat 1
was 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
and 1
joined 1
the 1
party 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
passing 1
by 1
a 1
farmyard 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
cock 1
perched 1
upon 1
a 1
gate 1
and 1
screaming 1
out 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
bravo 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
you 1
make 1
a 1
famous 1
noise 1
pray 1
what 1
is 1
all 1
this 1
about 1
why 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
i 1
was 1
just 1
now 1
saying 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
fine 1
weather 1
for 1
our 1
washingday 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
mistress 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
dont 1
thank 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
pains 1
but 1
threaten 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
head 1
tomorrow 1
and 1
make 1
broth 1
of 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
guests 1
that 1
are 1
coming 1
on 1
sunday 1
heaven 1
forbid 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
master 1
chanticleer 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
than 1
staying 1
here 1
to 1
have 1
your 1
head 1
cut 1
off 1
besides 1
who 1
knows 1
if 1
we 1
care 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
tune 1
we 1
may 1
get 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
concert 1
so 1
come 1
along 1
with 1
us 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
so 1
they 1
all 1
four 1
went 1
on 1
jollily 1
together 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
however 1
reach 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
so 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
a 1
wood 1
to 1
sleep 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
great 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
climbed 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
branches 1
while 1
the 1
cock 1
thinking 1
that 1
the 1
higher 1
he 1
sat 1
the 1
safer 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
flew 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
then 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
custom 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
looked 1
out 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
everything 1
was 1
well 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
he 1
saw 1
afar 1
off 1
something 1
bright 1
and 1
shining 1
and 1
calling 1
to 1
his 1
companions 1
said 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
house 1
no 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
for 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
light 1
if 1
that 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
change 1
our 1
quarters 1
for 1
our 1
lodging 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
besides 1
added 1
the 1
dog 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
a 1
bone 1
or 1
two 1
or 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
meat 1
so 1
they 1
walked 1
off 1
together 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
chanticleer 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
drew 1
near 1
it 1
became 1
larger 1
and 1
brighter 1
till 1
they 1
at 1
last 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
gang 1
of 1
robbers 1
lived 1
the 1
ass 1
being 1
the 1
tallest 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
marched 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
peeped 1
in 1
well 1
donkey 1
said 1
chanticleer 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
what 1
do 1
i 1
see 1
replied 1
the 1
ass 1
why 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
table 1
spread 1
with 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
and 1
robbers 1
sitting 1
round 1
it 1
making 1
merry 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
noble 1
lodging 1
for 1
us 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
only 1
get 1
in 1
so 1
they 1
consulted 1
together 1
how 1
they 1
should 1
contrive 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
robbers 1
out 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
the 1
ass 1
placed 1
himself 1
upright 1
on 1
his 1
hind 1
legs 1
with 1
his 1
forefeet 1
resting 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
dog 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
the 1
cat 1
scrambled 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
dogs 1
shoulders 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
flew 1
up 1
and 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
cats 1
head 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
ready 1
a 1
signal 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
they 1
began 1
their 1
music 1
the 1
ass 1
brayed 1
the 1
dog 1
barked 1
the 1
cat 1
mewed 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
screamed 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
came 1
tumbling 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
amongst 1
the 1
broken 1
glass 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
hideous 1
clatter 1
the 1
robbers 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
frightened 1
by 1
the 1
opening 1
concert 1
had 1
now 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
some 1
frightful 1
hobgoblin 1
had 1
broken 1
in 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
scampered 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
the 1
coast 1
once 1
clear 1
our 1
travellers 1
soon 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
dispatched 1
what 1
the 1
robbers 1
had 1
left 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
eagerness 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
expected 1
to 1
eat 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
month 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
satisfied 1
themselves 1
they 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
lights 1
and 1
each 1
once 1
more 1
sought 1
out 1
a 1
restingplace 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
liking 1
the 1
donkey 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
straw 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
the 1
dog 1
stretched 1
himself 1
upon 1
a 1
mat 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
cat 1
rolled 1
herself 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
hearth 1
before 1
the 1
warm 1
ashes 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
perched 1
upon 1
a 1
beam 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
rather 1
tired 1
with 1
their 1
journey 1
they 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
but 1
about 1
midnight 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
that 1
the 1
lights 1
were 1
out 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
quiet 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
too 1
great 1
a 1
hurry 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
was 1
bolder 1
than 1
the 1
rest 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
finding 1
everything 1
still 1
he 1
marched 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
groped 1
about 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
match 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
candle 1
and 1
then 1
espying 1
the 1
glittering 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
cat 1
he 1
mistook 1
them 1
for 1
live 1
coals 1
and 1
held 1
the 1
match 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
light 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
not 1
understanding 1
this 1
joke 1
sprang 1
at 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
spat 1
and 1
scratched 1
at 1
him 1
this 1
frightened 1
him 1
dreadfully 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
but 1
there 1
the 1
dog 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
bit 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
crossing 1
over 1
the 1
yard 1
the 1
ass 1
kicked 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
noise 1
crowed 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
at 1
this 1
the 1
robber 1
ran 1
back 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
his 1
comrades 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
captain 1
how 1
a 1
horrid 1
witch 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
had 1
spat 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
scratched 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
her 1
long 1
bony 1
fingers 1
how 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
had 1
hidden 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
stabbed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
how 1
a 1
black 1
monster 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
struck 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
club 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
devil 1
had 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
throw 1
the 1
rascal 1
up 1
here 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
robbers 1
never 1
dared 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
musicians 1
were 1
so 1
pleased 1
with 1
their 1
quarters 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
up 1
their 1
abode 1
there 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
are 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
at 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
old 1
sultan 1
a 1
shepherd 1
had 1
a 1
faithful 1
dog 1
called 1
sultan 1
who 1
was 1
grown 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
had 1
lost 1
all 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
standing 1
together 1
before 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
shepherd 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
shoot 1
old 1
sultan 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
now 1
but 1
his 1
wife 1
said 1
pray 1
let 1
the 1
poor 1
faithful 1
creature 1
live 1
he 1
has 1
served 1
us 1
well 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
livelihood 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
days 1
but 1
what 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
shepherd 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
tooth 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
thieves 1
dont 1
care 1
for 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
he 1
has 1
served 1
us 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
to 1
earn 1
his 1
livelihood 1
tomorrow 1
shall 1
be 1
his 1
last 1
day 1
depend 1
upon 1
it 1
poor 1
sultan 1
who 1
was 1
lying 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
heard 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
said 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
frightened 1
to 1
think 1
tomorrow 1
would 1
be 1
his 1
last 1
day 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
good 1
friend 1
the 1
wolf 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
sorrows 1
and 1
how 1
his 1
master 1
meant 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
make 1
yourself 1
easy 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
some 1
good 1
advice 1
your 1
master 1
you 1
know 1
goes 1
out 1
every 1
morning 1
very 1
early 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
they 1
take 1
their 1
little 1
child 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
lay 1
it 1
down 1
behind 1
the 1
hedge 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
while 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
work 1
now 1
do 1
you 1
lie 1
down 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
watching 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
you 1
must 1
run 1
after 1
me 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
let 1
it 1
drop 1
then 1
you 1
may 1
carry 1
it 1
back 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
their 1
child 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
thankful 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
live 1
the 1
dog 1
liked 1
this 1
plan 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
accordingly 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
managed 1
the 1
wolf 1
ran 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
screamed 1
out 1
but 1
sultan 1
soon 1
overtook 1
him 1
and 1
carried 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
thing 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
mistress 1
then 1
the 1
shepherd 1
patted 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
old 1
sultan 1
has 1
saved 1
our 1
child 1
from 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
shall 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
well 1
taken 1
care 1
of 1
and 1
have 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
wife 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
good 1
dinner 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
my 1
old 1
cushion 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
lives 1
so 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
forward 1
sultan 1
had 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wish 1
for 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
wolf 1
came 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
my 1
good 1
fellow 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
but 1
turn 1
your 1
head 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
when 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
taste 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
shepherds 1
fine 1
fat 1
sheep 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
sultan 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
however 1
the 1
wolf 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
joke 1
and 1
came 1
one 1
night 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
dainty 1
morsel 1
but 1
sultan 1
had 1
told 1
his 1
master 1
what 1
the 1
wolf 1
meant 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
behind 1
the 1
barn 1
door 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
busy 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
fat 1
sheep 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
stout 1
cudgel 1
laid 1
about 1
his 1
back 1
that 1
combed 1
his 1
locks 1
for 1
him 1
finely 1
then 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
called 1
sultan 1
an 1
old 1
rogue 1
and 1
swore 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
his 1
revenge 1
so 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
wolf 1
sent 1
the 1
boar 1
to 1
challenge 1
sultan 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
fight 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
sultan 1
had 1
nobody 1
he 1
could 1
ask 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
second 1
but 1
the 1
shepherds 1
old 1
threelegged 1
cat 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
poor 1
thing 1
limped 1
along 1
with 1
some 1
trouble 1
she 1
stuck 1
up 1
her 1
tail 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
boar 1
were 1
first 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
espied 1
their 1
enemies 1
coming 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
cats 1
long 1
tail 1
standing 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
carrying 1
a 1
sword 1
for 1
sultan 1
to 1
fight 1
with 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
she 1
limped 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
to 1
throw 1
at 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
this 1
way 1
of 1
fighting 1
and 1
the 1
boar 1
lay 1
down 1
behind 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
sultan 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
soon 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
wondered 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
there 1
the 1
boar 1
however 1
had 1
not 1
quite 1
hidden 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
ears 1
stuck 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
shook 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
cat 1
seeing 1
something 1
move 1
and 1
thinking 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
mouse 1
sprang 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
bit 1
and 1
scratched 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
boar 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
grunted 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
roaring 1
out 1
look 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
there 1
sits 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
to 1
blame 1
so 1
they 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
espied 1
the 1
wolf 1
sitting 1
amongst 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
they 1
called 1
him 1
a 1
cowardly 1
rascal 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
suffer 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
heartily 1
ashamed 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
friends 1
again 1
with 1
old 1
sultan 1
the 1
straw 1
the 1
coal 1
and 1
the 1
bean 1
in 1
a 1
village 1
dwelt 1
a 1
poor 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
gathered 1
together 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
beans 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
cook 1
them 1
so 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
her 1
hearth 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
burn 1
the 1
quicker 1
she 1
lighted 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
straw 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
emptying 1
the 1
beans 1
into 1
the 1
pan 1
one 1
dropped 1
without 1
her 1
observing 1
it 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
beside 1
a 1
straw 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
a 1
burning 1
coal 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
leapt 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
then 1
the 1
straw 1
began 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
friends 1
from 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
the 1
coal 1
replied 1
i 1
fortunately 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
escaped 1
by 1
sheer 1
force 1
my 1
death 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
certaini 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
burnt 1
to 1
ashes 1
the 1
bean 1
said 1
i 1
too 1
have 1
escaped 1
with 1
a 1
whole 1
skin 1
but 1
if 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
got 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
pan 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
into 1
broth 1
without 1
any 1
mercy 1
like 1
my 1
comrades 1
and 1
would 1
a 1
better 1
fate 1
have 1
fallen 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
said 1
the 1
straw 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
has 1
destroyed 1
all 1
my 1
brethren 1
in 1
fire 1
and 1
smoke 1
she 1
seized 1
sixty 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
lives 1
i 1
luckily 1
slipped 1
through 1
her 1
fingers 1
but 1
what 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
coal 1
i 1
think 1
answered 1
the 1
bean 1
that 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
fortunately 1
escaped 1
death 1
we 1
should 1
keep 1
together 1
like 1
good 1
companions 1
and 1
lest 1
a 1
new 1
mischance 1
should 1
overtake 1
us 1
here 1
we 1
should 1
go 1
away 1
together 1
and 1
repair 1
to 1
a 1
foreign 1
country 1
the 1
proposition 1
pleased 1
the 1
two 1
others 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
together 1
soon 1
however 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
brook 1
and 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
bridge 1
or 1
footplank 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
it 1
the 1
straw 1
hit 1
on 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
straight 1
across 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
walk 1
over 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
on 1
a 1
bridge 1
the 1
straw 1
therefore 1
stretched 1
itself 1
from 1
one 1
bank 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
the 1
coal 1
who 1
was 1
of 1
an 1
impetuous 1
disposition 1
tripped 1
quite 1
boldly 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
newlybuilt 1
bridge 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
water 1
rushing 1
beneath 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
after 1
all 1
afraid 1
and 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
ventured 1
no 1
farther 1
the 1
straw 1
however 1
began 1
to 1
burn 1
broke 1
in 1
two 1
pieces 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
the 1
coal 1
slipped 1
after 1
her 1
hissed 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
breathed 1
her 1
last 1
the 1
bean 1
who 1
had 1
prudently 1
stayed 1
behind 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
laugh 1
at 1
the 1
event 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
laughed 1
so 1
heartily 1
that 1
she 1
burst 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
her 1
likewise 1
if 1
by 1
good 1
fortune 1
a 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
travelling 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
work 1
had 1
not 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
by 1
the 1
brook 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
compassionate 1
heart 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
sewed 1
her 1
together 1
the 1
bean 1
thanked 1
him 1
most 1
prettily 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
tailor 1
used 1
black 1
thread 1
all 1
beans 1
since 1
then 1
have 1
a 1
black 1
seam 1
briar 1
rose 1
a 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
reigned 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
in 1
those 1
days 1
fairies 1
now 1
this 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
plenty 1
of 1
fine 1
clothes 1
to 1
wear 1
and 1
plenty 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
and 1
a 1
coach 1
to 1
ride 1
out 1
in 1
every 1
day 1
but 1
though 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
married 1
many 1
years 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
children 1
and 1
this 1
grieved 1
them 1
very 1
much 1
indeed 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
walking 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
poor 1
little 1
fish 1
that 1
had 1
thrown 1
itself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
lay 1
gasping 1
and 1
nearly 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
then 1
the 1
queen 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
fish 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
back 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
before 1
it 1
swam 1
away 1
it 1
lifted 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
and 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
to 1
meyou 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
what 1
the 1
little 1
fish 1
had 1
foretold 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
so 1
very 1
beautiful 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
could 1
not 1
cease 1
looking 1
on 1
it 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
hold 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
and 1
make 1
merry 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
so 1
he 1
asked 1
his 1
kinsmen 1
and 1
nobles 1
and 1
friends 1
and 1
neighbours 1
but 1
the 1
queen 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
fairies 1
also 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
kind 1
and 1
good 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
daughter 1
now 1
there 1
were 1
thirteen 1
fairies 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
had 1
only 1
twelve 1
golden 1
dishes 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
they 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
leave 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
fairies 1
without 1
asking 1
her 1
so 1
twelve 1
fairies 1
came 1
each 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
red 1
cap 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
red 1
shoes 1
with 1
high 1
heels 1
on 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
wand 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
over 1
they 1
gathered 1
round 1
in 1
a 1
ring 1
and 1
gave 1
all 1
their 1
best 1
gifts 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
princess 1
one 1
gave 1
her 1
goodness 1
another 1
beauty 1
another 1
riches 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
till 1
she 1
had 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
just 1
as 1
eleven 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
done 1
blessing 1
her 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
was 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
word 1
was 1
brought 1
that 1
the 1
thirteenth 1
fairy 1
was 1
come 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
cap 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
black 1
shoes 1
on 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
a 1
broomstick 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
presently 1
up 1
she 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
dininghall 1
now 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
asked 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
scolded 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
revenge 1
so 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
shall 1
in 1
her 1
fifteenth 1
year 1
be 1
wounded 1
by 1
a 1
spindle 1
and 1
fall 1
down 1
dead 1
then 1
the 1
twelfth 1
of 1
the 1
friendly 1
fairies 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
given 1
her 1
gift 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
evil 1
wish 1
must 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
soften 1
its 1
mischief 1
so 1
her 1
gift 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
when 1
the 1
spindle 1
wounded 1
her 1
should 1
not 1
really 1
die 1
but 1
should 1
only 1
fall 1
asleep 1
for 1
a 1
hundred 1
years 1
however 1
the 1
king 1
hoped 1
still 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
dear 1
child 1
altogether 1
from 1
the 1
threatened 1
evil 1
so 1
he 1
ordered 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
spindles 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
should 1
be 1
bought 1
up 1
and 1
burnt 1
but 1
all 1
the 1
gifts 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
eleven 1
fairies 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
fulfilled 1
for 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
well 1
behaved 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
wise 1
that 1
everyone 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
loved 1
her 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
palace 1
so 1
she 1
roved 1
about 1
by 1
herself 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
rooms 1
and 1
chambers 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
old 1
tower 1
to 1
which 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
staircase 1
ending 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
golden 1
key 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
turned 1
it 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
an 1
old 1
lady 1
spinning 1
away 1
very 1
busily 1
why 1
how 1
now 1
good 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
spinning 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
and 1
nodded 1
her 1
head 1
humming 1
a 1
tune 1
while 1
buzz 1
went 1
the 1
wheel 1
how 1
prettily 1
that 1
little 1
thing 1
turns 1
round 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
spindle 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
spin 1
but 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
touched 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
fairys 1
prophecy 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
the 1
spindle 1
wounded 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
lifeless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
however 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
dead 1
but 1
had 1
only 1
fallen 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
all 1
their 1
court 1
fell 1
asleep 1
too 1
and 1
the 1
horses 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
the 1
pigeons 1
on 1
the 1
housetop 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
flies 1
slept 1
upon 1
the 1
walls 1
even 1
the 1
fire 1
on 1
the 1
hearth 1
left 1
off 1
blazing 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
the 1
jack 1
stopped 1
and 1
the 1
spit 1
that 1
was 1
turning 1
about 1
with 1
a 1
goose 1
upon 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
kings 1
dinner 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
who 1
was 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
pulling 1
the 1
kitchenboy 1
by 1
the 1
hair 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
for 1
something 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
amiss 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
both 1
fell 1
asleep 1
the 1
butler 1
who 1
was 1
slyly 1
tasting 1
the 1
ale 1
fell 1
asleep 1
with 1
the 1
jug 1
at 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
thus 1
everything 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
slept 1
soundly 1
a 1
large 1
hedge 1
of 1
thorns 1
soon 1
grew 1
round 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
every 1
year 1
it 1
became 1
higher 1
and 1
thicker 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
old 1
palace 1
was 1
surrounded 1
and 1
hidden 1
so 1
that 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
roof 1
or 1
the 1
chimneys 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
but 1
there 1
went 1
a 1
report 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
sleeping 1
briar 1
rose 1
for 1
so 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
was 1
called 1
so 1
that 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
several 1
kings 1
sons 1
came 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
break 1
through 1
the 1
thicket 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
this 1
however 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
ever 1
do 1
for 1
the 1
thorns 1
and 1
bushes 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
with 1
hands 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
died 1
wretchedly 1
after 1
many 1
many 1
years 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
kings 1
son 1
into 1
that 1
land 1
and 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
thicket 1
of 1
thorns 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
beautiful 1
palace 1
stood 1
behind 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
wonderful 1
princess 1
called 1
briar 1
rose 1
lay 1
in 1
it 1
asleep 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
court 1
he 1
told 1
too 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
from 1
his 1
grandfather 1
that 1
many 1
many 1
princes 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
break 1
through 1
the 1
thicket 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
stuck 1
fast 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
died 1
then 1
the 1
young 1
prince 1
said 1
all 1
this 1
shall 1
not 1
frighten 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
this 1
briar 1
rose 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
tried 1
to 1
hinder 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
bent 1
upon 1
going 1
now 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
the 1
hundred 1
years 1
were 1
ended 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
prince 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
thicket 1
he 1
saw 1
nothing 1
but 1
beautiful 1
flowering 1
shrubs 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
ease 1
and 1
they 1
shut 1
in 1
after 1
him 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
ever 1
then 1
he 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
lay 1
the 1
dogs 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
horses 1
were 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
sat 1
the 1
pigeons 1
fast 1
asleep 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
under 1
their 1
wings 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
the 1
flies 1
were 1
sleeping 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
the 1
spit 1
was 1
standing 1
still 1
the 1
butler 1
had 1
the 1
jug 1
of 1
ale 1
at 1
his 1
lips 1
going 1
to 1
drink 1
a 1
draught 1
the 1
maid 1
sat 1
with 1
a 1
fowl 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
plucked 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
was 1
still 1
holding 1
up 1
her 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
beat 1
the 1
boy 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
still 1
farther 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
every 1
breath 1
he 1
drew 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
tower 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
briar 1
rose 1
was 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
lay 1
fast 1
asleep 1
on 1
a 1
couch 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
she 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
her 1
so 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
kiss 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
awoke 1
and 1
smiled 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
also 1
awoke 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
gazed 1
on 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
great 1
wonder 1
and 1
the 1
horses 1
shook 1
themselves 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
barked 1
the 1
pigeons 1
took 1
their 1
heads 1
from 1
under 1
their 1
wings 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
flew 1
into 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
flies 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
buzzed 1
again 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
blazed 1
up 1
round 1
went 1
the 1
jack 1
and 1
round 1
went 1
the 1
spit 1
with 1
the 1
goose 1
for 1
the 1
kings 1
dinner 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
butler 1
finished 1
his 1
draught 1
of 1
ale 1
the 1
maid 1
went 1
on 1
plucking 1
the 1
fowl 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
gave 1
the 1
boy 1
the 1
box 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
briar 1
rose 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
long 1
the 1
dog 1
and 1
the 1
sparrow 1
a 1
shepherds 1
dog 1
had 1
a 1
master 1
who 1
took 1
no 1
care 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
often 1
let 1
him 1
suffer 1
the 1
greatest 1
hunger 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
bear 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
off 1
he 1
ran 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sad 1
and 1
sorrowful 1
mood 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
he 1
met 1
a 1
sparrow 1
that 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
my 1
friend 1
because 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
very 1
hungry 1
and 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
if 1
that 1
be 1
all 1
answered 1
the 1
sparrow 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
town 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
you 1
plenty 1
of 1
food 1
so 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
together 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
butchers 1
shop 1
the 1
sparrow 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
dog 1
stand 1
there 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
till 1
i 1
peck 1
you 1
down 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
so 1
the 1
sparrow 1
perched 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
and 1
having 1
first 1
looked 1
carefully 1
about 1
her 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anyone 1
was 1
watching 1
her 1
she 1
pecked 1
and 1
scratched 1
at 1
a 1
steak 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
shelf 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
down 1
it 1
fell 1
then 1
the 1
dog 1
snapped 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
scrambled 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
where 1
he 1
soon 1
ate 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
some 1
more 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
so 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
shop 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
peck 1
you 1
down 1
another 1
steak 1
when 1
the 1
dog 1
had 1
eaten 1
this 1
too 1
the 1
sparrow 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
well 1
my 1
good 1
friend 1
have 1
you 1
had 1
enough 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
meat 1
answered 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
to 1
eat 1
after 1
it 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
that 1
too 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
bakers 1
shop 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
two 1
rolls 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
till 1
they 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
dog 1
still 1
wished 1
for 1
more 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
another 1
shop 1
and 1
pecked 1
down 1
some 1
more 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
that 1
was 1
eaten 1
the 1
sparrow 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
enough 1
now 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
take 1
a 1
walk 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
so 1
they 1
both 1
went 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
high 1
road 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
warm 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
the 1
dog 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
tiredi 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
nap 1
very 1
well 1
answered 1
the 1
sparrow 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
will 1
perch 1
upon 1
that 1
bush 1
so 1
the 1
dog 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
whilst 1
he 1
slept 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
a 1
carter 1
with 1
a 1
cart 1
drawn 1
by 1
three 1
horses 1
and 1
loaded 1
with 1
two 1
casks 1
of 1
wine 1
the 1
sparrow 1
seeing 1
that 1
the 1
carter 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
but 1
would 1
go 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
track 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
dog 1
lay 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
drive 1
over 1
him 1
called 1
out 1
stop 1
stop 1
mr 1
carter 1
or 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
you 1
but 1
the 1
carter 1
grumbling 1
to 1
himself 1
you 1
make 1
it 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
me 1
indeed 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
cracked 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
drove 1
his 1
cart 1
over 1
the 1
poor 1
dog 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
crushed 1
him 1
to 1
death 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
sparrow 1
thou 1
cruel 1
villain 1
thou 1
hast 1
killed 1
my 1
friend 1
the 1
dog 1
now 1
mind 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
this 1
deed 1
of 1
thine 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
all 1
thou 1
art 1
worth 1
do 1
your 1
worst 1
and 1
welcome 1
said 1
the 1
brute 1
what 1
harm 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
me 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
sparrow 1
crept 1
under 1
the 1
tilt 1
of 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
the 1
bung 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
casks 1
till 1
she 1
loosened 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
the 1
wine 1
ran 1
out 1
without 1
the 1
carter 1
seeing 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
was 1
dripping 1
and 1
the 1
cask 1
quite 1
empty 1
what 1
an 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
i 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
as 1
she 1
alighted 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
horses 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
reared 1
up 1
and 1
kicked 1
when 1
the 1
carter 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
drew 1
out 1
his 1
hatchet 1
and 1
aimed 1
a 1
blow 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
meaning 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
poor 1
horses 1
head 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
carter 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
horses 1
she 1
again 1
crept 1
under 1
the 1
tilt 1
of 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
pecked 1
out 1
the 1
bung 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
cask 1
so 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
wine 1
ran 1
out 1
when 1
the 1
carter 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
again 1
cried 1
out 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
but 1
the 1
sparrow 1
answered 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
and 1
perched 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
horse 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
him 1
too 1
the 1
carter 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
struck 1
at 1
her 1
again 1
with 1
his 1
hatchet 1
but 1
away 1
she 1
flew 1
and 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
horse 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
said 1
he 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
and 1
perching 1
upon 1
the 1
third 1
horse 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
peck 1
him 1
too 1
the 1
carter 1
was 1
mad 1
with 1
fury 1
and 1
without 1
looking 1
about 1
him 1
or 1
caring 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
struck 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
but 1
killed 1
his 1
third 1
horse 1
as 1
he 1
done 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
alas 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1

sparrow 1
as 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1

plague 1
and 1
punish 1
thee 1
at 1
thy 1

the 1
carter 1
was 1
forced 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
cart 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
overflowing 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
vexation 1
alas 1

he 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1

into 1

and 1
has 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
fallen 1
upon 1
our 1
corn 1
in 1
the 1
loft 1
and 1
are 1
eating 1
it 1
up 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
rate 1
away 1
ran 1
the 1
husband 1
upstairs 1
and 1
saw 1
thousands 1
of 1
birds 1
sitting 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
eating 1
up 1
his 1
corn 1
with 1
the 1
sparrow 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
cried 1
the 1
carter 1
for 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
corn 1
was 1
almost 1
all 1
gone 1
not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
thy 1
cruelty 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
yet 1
and 1
away 1
she 1
flew 1
the 1
carter 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
thus 1
lost 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
his 1
kitchen 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
sorry 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
but 1
sat 1
himself 1
angrily 1
and 1
sulkily 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
corner 1
but 1
the 1
sparrow 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
cried 1
carter 1
thy 1
cruelty 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
seized 1
his 1
hatchet 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
but 1
it 1
missed 1
her 1
and 1
only 1
broke 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
sparrow 1
now 1
hopped 1
in 1
perched 1
upon 1
the 1
windowseat 1
and 1
cried 1
carter 1
it 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
then 1
he 1
became 1
mad 1
and 1
blind 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
windowseat 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
he 1
cleft 1
it 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
sparrow 1
flew 1
from 1
place 1
to 1
place 1
the 1
carter 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
so 1
furious 1
that 1
they 1
broke 1
all 1
their 1
furniture 1
glasses 1
chairs 1
benches 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
walls 1
without 1
touching 1
the 1
bird 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
however 1
they 1
caught 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
wife 1
said 1
shall 1
i 1
kill 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
no 1
cried 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
letting 1
her 1
off 1
too 1
easily 1
she 1
shall 1
die 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
cruel 1
death 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
her 1
but 1
the 1
sparrow 1
began 1
to 1
flutter 1
about 1
and 1
stretch 1
out 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
cried 1
carter 1
it 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
yet 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wait 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
his 1
wife 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cried 1
wife 1
strike 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
kill 1
her 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
wife 1
struck 1
but 1
she 1
missed 1
her 1
aim 1
and 1
hit 1
her 1
husband 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
sparrow 1
flew 1
quietly 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
nest 1
the 1
twelve 1
dancing 1
princesses 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
twelve 1
beautiful 1
daughters 1
they 1
slept 1
in 1
twelve 1
beds 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
room 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
shut 1
and 1
locked 1
up 1
but 1
every 1
morning 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
found 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
worn 1
through 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
danced 1
in 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
yet 1
nobody 1
could 1
find 1
out 1
how 1
it 1
happened 1
or 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
person 1
could 1
discover 1
the 1
secret 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
danced 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
one 1
he 1
liked 1
best 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
king 1
after 1
his 1
death 1
but 1
whoever 1
tried 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
succeed 1
after 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
a 1
kings 1
son 1
soon 1
came 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
entertained 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
one 1
where 1
the 1
princesses 1
lay 1
in 1
their 1
twelve 1
beds 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
watch 1
where 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
dance 1
and 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
nothing 1
might 1
pass 1
without 1
his 1
hearing 1
it 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
chamber 1
was 1
left 1
open 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
dancing 1
for 1
the 1
soles 1
of 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
the 1
second 1
and 1
third 1
night 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
be 1
cut 1
off 1
after 1
him 1
came 1
several 1
others 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
luck 1
and 1
all 1
lost 1
their 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
now 1
it 1
chanced 1
that 1
an 1
old 1
soldier 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
wounded 1
in 1
battle 1
and 1
could 1
fight 1
no 1
longer 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
country 1
where 1
this 1
king 1
reigned 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
travelling 1
through 1
a 1
wood 1
he 1
met 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
i 1
hardly 1
know 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
do 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
dance 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
time 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
king 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
dame 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
very 1
hard 1
task 1
only 1
take 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
drink 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
which 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
will 1
bring 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
leaves 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
fast 1
asleep 1
then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
cloak 1
and 1
said 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
put 1
that 1
on 1
you 1
will 1
become 1
invisible 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
princesses 1
wherever 1
they 1
go 1
when 1
the 1
soldier 1
heard 1
all 1
this 1
good 1
counsel 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
try 1
his 1
luck 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
undertake 1
the 1
task 1
he 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
received 1
as 1
the 1
others 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
fine 1
royal 1
robes 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
outer 1
chamber 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
the 1
eldest 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
wine 1
but 1
the 1
soldier 1
threw 1
it 1
all 1
away 1
secretly 1
taking 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
drink 1
a 1
drop 1
then 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
very 1
loud 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
fast 1
asleep 1
when 1
the 1
twelve 1
princesses 1
heard 1
this 1
they 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
and 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
this 1
fellow 1
too 1
might 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
wiser 1
thing 1
than 1
lose 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
then 1
they 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
their 1
drawers 1
and 1
boxes 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
all 1
their 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
at 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
skipped 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
eager 1
to 1
begin 1
dancing 1
but 1
the 1
youngest 1
said 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
happy 1
i 1
feel 1
very 1
uneasy 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
some 1
mischance 1
will 1
befall 1
us 1
you 1
simpleton 1
said 1
the 1
eldest 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
afraid 1
have 1
you 1
forgotten 1
how 1
many 1
kings 1
sons 1
have 1
already 1
watched 1
in 1
vain 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
this 1
soldier 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
given 1
him 1
his 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
slept 1
soundly 1
enough 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
ready 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
soldier 1
but 1
he 1
snored 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
hand 1
or 1
foot 1
so 1
they 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
safe 1
and 1
the 1
eldest 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
bed 1
and 1
clapped 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
the 1
bed 1
sank 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
a 1
trapdoor 1
flew 1
open 1
the 1
soldier 1
saw 1
them 1
going 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
trapdoor 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
the 1
eldest 1
leading 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
thinking 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
lose 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
cloak 1
which 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
and 1
followed 1
them 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
he 1
trod 1
on 1
the 1
gown 1
of 1
the 1
youngest 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
sisters 1
all 1
is 1
not 1
right 1
someone 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
gown 1
you 1
silly 1
creature 1
said 1
the 1
eldest 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
nail 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
then 1
down 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
most 1
delightful 1
grove 1
of 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
silver 1
and 1
glittered 1
and 1
sparkled 1
beautifully 1
the 1
soldier 1
wished 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
some 1
token 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
so 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
branch 1
and 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
then 1
the 1
youngest 1
daughter 1
said 1
again 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
all 1
is 1
not 1
rightdid 1
not 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
noise 1
that 1
never 1
happened 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
our 1
princes 1
who 1
are 1
shouting 1
for 1
joy 1
at 1
our 1
approach 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
another 1
grove 1
of 1
trees 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
afterwards 1
to 1
a 1
third 1
where 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
all 1
glittering 1
diamonds 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
broke 1
a 1
branch 1
from 1
each 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
youngest 1
sister 1
tremble 1
with 1
fear 1
but 1
the 1
eldest 1
still 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
princes 1
who 1
were 1
crying 1
for 1
joy 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
lake 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
there 1
lay 1
twelve 1
little 1
boats 1
with 1
twelve 1
handsome 1
princes 1
in 1
them 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
waiting 1
there 1
for 1
the 1
princesses 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
went 1
into 1
each 1
boat 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
youngest 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
rowing 1
over 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
prince 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
youngest 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
why 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
though 1
i 1
am 1
rowing 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
might 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
get 1
on 1
so 1
fast 1
as 1
usual 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
tired 1
the 1
boat 1
seems 1
very 1
heavy 1
today 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
i 1
feel 1
it 1
very 1
warm 1
too 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
stood 1
a 1
fine 1
illuminated 1
castle 1
from 1
which 1
came 1
the 1
merry 1
music 1
of 1
horns 1
and 1
trumpets 1
there 1
they 1
all 1
landed 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
each 1
prince 1
danced 1
with 1
his 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
who 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
invisible 1
danced 1
with 1
them 1
too 1
and 1
when 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
had 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
wine 1
set 1
by 1
her 1
he 1
drank 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
cup 1
to 1
her 1
mouth 1
it 1
was 1
empty 1
at 1
this 1
too 1
the 1
youngest 1
sister 1
was 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
but 1
the 1
eldest 1
always 1
silenced 1
her 1
they 1
danced 1
on 1
till 1
three 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
worn 1
out 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
obliged 1
to 1
leave 1
off 1
the 1
princes 1
rowed 1
them 1
back 1
again 1
over 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
soldier 1
placed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
eldest 1
princess 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
opposite 1
shore 1
they 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
princesses 1
promising 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
night 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
soldier 1
ran 1
on 1
before 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
twelve 1
sisters 1
slowly 1
came 1
up 1
very 1
much 1
tired 1
they 1
heard 1
him 1
snoring 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
now 1
all 1
is 1
quite 1
safe 1
then 1
they 1
undressed 1
themselves 1
put 1
away 1
their 1
fine 1
clothes 1
pulled 1
off 1
their 1
shoes 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
determined 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
adventure 1
and 1
went 1
again 1
the 1
second 1
and 1
third 1
night 1
and 1
every 1
thing 1
happened 1
just 1
as 1
before 1
the 1
princesses 1
danced 1
each 1
time 1
till 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
worn 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
home 1
however 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
soldier 1
carried 1
away 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
cups 1
as 1
a 1
token 1
of 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
declare 1
the 1
secret 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
branches 1
and 1
the 1
golden 1
cup 1
and 1
the 1
twelve 1
princesses 1
stood 1
listening 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
hear 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
asked 1
him 1
where 1
do 1
my 1
twelve 1
daughters 1
dance 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
answered 1
with 1
twelve 1
princes 1
in 1
a 1
castle 1
under 1
ground 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
three 1
branches 1
and 1
the 1
golden 1
cup 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
asked 1
them 1
whether 1
what 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
discovered 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
deny 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
they 1
confessed 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
asked 1
the 1
soldier 1
which 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
choose 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
very 1
young 1
so 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
eldestand 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
chosen 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
kings 1
heir 1
the 1
fisherman 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
fisherman 1
who 1
lived 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
in 1
a 1
pigsty 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
seaside 1
the 1
fisherman 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
afishing 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
with 1
his 1
rod 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
sparkling 1
waves 1
and 1
watching 1
his 1
line 1
all 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
his 1
float 1
was 1
dragged 1
away 1
deep 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
in 1
drawing 1
it 1
up 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
a 1
great 1
fish 1
but 1
the 1
fish 1
said 1
pray 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
real 1
fish 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
put 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
again 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
oh 1
ho 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
make 1
so 1
many 1
words 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
a 1
fish 1
that 1
can 1
talk 1
so 1
swim 1
away 1
sir 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
then 1
he 1
put 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
fish 1
darted 1
straight 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
and 1
left 1
a 1
long 1
streak 1
of 1
blood 1
behind 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
wave 1
when 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
in 1
the 1
pigsty 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
great 1
fish 1
and 1
how 1
it 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
and 1
how 1
on 1
hearing 1
it 1
speak 1
he 1
had 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
again 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
ask 1
it 1
for 1
anything 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
we 1
live 1
very 1
wretchedly 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
nasty 1
dirty 1
pigsty 1
do 1
go 1
back 1
and 1
tell 1
the 1
fish 1
we 1
want 1
a 1
snug 1
little 1
cottage 1
the 1
fisherman 1
did 1
not 1
much 1
like 1
the 1
business 1
however 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
seashore 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
there 1
the 1
water 1
looked 1
all 1
yellow 1
and 1
green 1
and 1
he 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
waters 1
edge 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
then 1
the 1
fish 1
came 1
swimming 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
well 1
what 1
is 1
her 1
will 1
what 1
does 1
your 1
wife 1
want 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
she 1
says 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
caught 1
you 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
asked 1
you 1
for 1
something 1
before 1
i 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
like 1
living 1
any 1
longer 1
in 1
the 1
pigsty 1
and 1
wants 1
a 1
snug 1
little 1
cottage 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
already 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
a 1
nice 1
trim 1
little 1
cottage 1
come 1
in 1
come 1
in 1
said 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
filthy 1
pigsty 1
we 1
had 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
parlour 1
and 1
a 1
bedchamber 1
and 1
a 1
kitchen 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
cottage 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
garden 1
planted 1
with 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
flowers 1
and 1
fruits 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
courtyard 1
behind 1
full 1
of 1
ducks 1
and 1
chickens 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
how 1
happily 1
we 1
shall 1
live 1
now 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
his 1
wife 1
everything 1
went 1
right 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
dame 1
ilsabill 1
said 1
husband 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
near 1
room 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
in 1
this 1
cottage 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
the 1
garden 1
are 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
too 1
small 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
large 1
stone 1
castle 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
again 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
castle 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
for 1
perhaps 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
angry 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
easy 1
with 1
this 1
pretty 1
cottage 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
nonsense 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
he 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
very 1
willingly 1
i 1
know 1
go 1
along 1
and 1
try 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
very 1
heavy 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
looked 1
blue 1
and 1
gloomy 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
calm 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
well 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
dolefully 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
a 1
stone 1
castle 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
it 1
already 1
so 1
away 1
went 1
the 1
fisherman 1
and 1
found 1
his 1
wife 1
standing 1
before 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
castle 1
see 1
said 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
grand 1
with 1
that 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
together 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
servants 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
rooms 1
all 1
richly 1
furnished 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
golden 1
chairs 1
and 1
tables 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
around 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
park 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
long 1
full 1
of 1
sheep 1
and 1
goats 1
and 1
hares 1
and 1
deer 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
were 1
stables 1
and 1
cowhouses 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
now 1
we 1
will 1
live 1
cheerful 1
and 1
happy 1
in 1
this 1
beautiful 1
castle 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
perhaps 1
we 1
may 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
sleep 1
upon 1
it 1
before 1
we 1
make 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
to 1
that 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
dame 1
ilsabill 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
broad 1
daylight 1
and 1
she 1
jogged 1
the 1
fisherman 1
with 1
her 1
elbow 1
and 1
said 1
get 1
up 1
husband 1
and 1
bestir 1
yourself 1
for 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
king 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
wife 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
king 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
king 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
said 1
she 1
but 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
kingthe 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
you 1
a 1
king 1
husband 1
said 1
she 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
king 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
away 1
quite 1
sorrowful 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
should 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
sea 1
looked 1
a 1
dark 1
grey 1
colour 1
and 1
was 1
overspread 1
with 1
curling 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
ridges 1
of 1
foam 1
as 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
well 1
what 1
would 1
she 1
have 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
alas 1
said 1
the 1
poor 1
man 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
king 1
already 1
then 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
soldiers 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
drums 1
and 1
trumpets 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
throne 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
diamonds 1
with 1

taller 1
than 1

and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1

at 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
said 1

fine 1
thing 1

long 1
time 1
i 1
am 1
king 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1

i 1
think 1
i 1

alas 1
wife 1

wish 1
to 1

the 1
fisherman 1
husband 1
said 1

go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
emperor 1
ah 1
wife 1
replied 1
the 1
fisherman 1
the 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
an 1
emperor 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
i 1
am 1
king 1
said 1
ilsabill 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
slave 1
so 1
go 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
the 1
fisherman 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
along 1
this 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
no 1
good 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
fish 1
will 1
be 1
tired 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
he 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
seashore 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
quite 1
black 1
and 1
muddy 1
and 1
a 1
mighty 1
whirlwind 1
blew 1
over 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
rolled 1
them 1
about 1
but 1
he 1
went 1
as 1
near 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
the 1
waters 1
brink 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
what 1
would 1
she 1
have 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
she 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
emperor 1
already 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
lofty 1
throne 1
made 1
of 1
solid 1
gold 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
crown 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
full 1
two 1
yards 1
high 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
stood 1
her 1
guards 1
and 1
attendants 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
each 1
one 1
smaller 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
from 1
the 1
tallest 1
giant 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
no 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
finger 1
and 1
before 1
her 1
stood 1
princes 1
and 1
dukes 1
and 1
earls 1
and 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
wife 1
are 1
you 1
emperor 1
yes 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
emperor 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
upon 1
her 1
what 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
husband 1
said 1
she 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
stop 1
at 1
being 1
emperor 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
pope 1
next 1
o 1
wife 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
pope 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
pope 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
christendom 1
husband 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
pope 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
but 1
replied 1
the 1
husband 1
the 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
you 1
pope 1
what 1
nonsense 1
said 1
she 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
an 1
emperor 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
pope 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
him 1
so 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
raging 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
was 1
tossed 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
boiling 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
ships 1
were 1
in 1
trouble 1
and 1
rolled 1
fearfully 1
upon 1
the 1
tops 1
of 1
the 1
billows 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
blue 1
sky 1
but 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
all 1
was 1
red 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
dreadful 1
storm 1
was 1
rising 1
at 1
this 1
sight 1
the 1
fisherman 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
frightened 1
and 1
he 1
trembled 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
knees 1
knocked 1
together 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
pope 1
go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
pope 1
already 1
then 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
found 1
ilsabill 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
throne 1
that 1
was 1
two 1
miles 1
high 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
three 1
great 1
crowns 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
around 1
her 1
stood 1
all 1
the 1
pomp 1
and 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
were 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
burning 1
lights 1
of 1
all 1
sizes 1
the 1
greatest 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
the 1
highest 1
and 1
biggest 1
tower 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
least 1
no 1
larger 1
than 1
a 1
small 1
rushlight 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
greatness 1
are 1
you 1
pope 1
yes 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
pope 1
well 1
wife 1
replied 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
grand 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
pope 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
easy 1
for 1
you 1
can 1
be 1
nothing 1
greater 1
i 1
will 1
think 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
dame 1
ilsabill 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
all 1
night 1
for 1
thinking 1
what 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
next 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dropping 1
asleep 1
morning 1
broke 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
ha 1
thought 1
she 1
as 1
she 1
woke 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
cannot 1
prevent 1
the 1
sun 1
rising 1
at 1
this 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
wakened 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
husband 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
the 1
fisherman 1
was 1
half 1
asleep 1
but 1
the 1
thought 1
frightened 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
started 1
and 1
fell 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
alas 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
cannot 1
you 1
be 1
easy 1
with 1
being 1
pope 1
no 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
uneasy 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
rise 1
without 1
my 1
leave 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
at 1
once 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
shivering 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
dreadful 1
storm 1
arose 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
rocks 1
shook 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
heavens 1
became 1
black 1
with 1
stormy 1
clouds 1
and 1
the 1
lightnings 1
played 1
and 1
the 1
thunders 1
rolled 1
and 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
great 1
black 1
waves 1
swelling 1
up 1
like 1
mountains 1
with 1
crowns 1
of 1
white 1
foam 1
upon 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
the 1
fisherman 1
crept 1
towards 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
o 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
wife 1
ilsabill 1
will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
and 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
she 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
to 1
your 1
pigsty 1
again 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
live 1
to 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
the 1
willowwren 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
once 1
in 1
summertime 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
were 1
walking 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
heard 1
a 1
bird 1
singing 1
so 1
beautifully 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
brother 1
wolf 1
what 1
bird 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
sings 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
birds 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
before 1
whom 1
we 1
must 1
bow 1
down 1
in 1
reality 1
the 1
bird 1
was 1
the 1
willowwren 1
if 1
thats 1
the 1
case 1
said 1
the 1
bear 1
i 1
should 1
very 1
much 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
royal 1
palace 1
come 1
take 1
me 1
thither 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
done 1
quite 1
as 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
you 1
must 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
queen 1
comes 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
queen 1
arrived 1
with 1
some 1
food 1
in 1
her 1
beak 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
king 1
came 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
feed 1
their 1
young 1
ones 1
the 1
bear 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
go 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
held 1
him 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
sleeve 1
and 1
said 1
no 1
you 1
must 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
lord 1
and 1
lady 1
queen 1
have 1
gone 1
away 1
again 1
so 1
they 1
took 1
stock 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
where 1
the 1
nest 1
lay 1
and 1
trotted 1
away 1
the 1
bear 1
however 1
could 1
not 1
rest 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
had 1
passed 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
again 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
had 1
just 1
flown 1
out 1
so 1
he 1
peeped 1
in 1
and 1
saw 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
young 1
ones 1
lying 1
there 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
cried 1
the 1
bear 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
wretched 1
palace 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
kings 1
children 1
you 1
are 1
disreputable 1
children 1
when 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
frightfully 1
angry 1
and 1
screamed 1
no 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
our 1
parents 1
are 1
honest 1
people 1
bear 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
that 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
grew 1
uneasy 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
their 1
holes 1
the 1
young 1
willowwrens 1
however 1
continued 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
scream 1
and 1
when 1
their 1
parents 1
again 1
brought 1
food 1
they 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
touch 1
one 1
flys 1
leg 1
no 1
not 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
dying 1
of 1
hunger 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
settled 1
whether 1
we 1
are 1
respectable 1
children 1
or 1
not 1
the 1
bear 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
insulted 1
us 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
said 1
be 1
easy 1
he 1
shall 1
be 1
punished 1
and 1
he 1
at 1
once 1
flew 1
with 1
the 1
queen 1
to 1
the 1
bears 1
cave 1
and 1
called 1
in 1
old 1
growler 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
insulted 1
my 1
children 1
you 1
shall 1
suffer 1
for 1
itwe 1
will 1
punish 1
you 1
by 1
a 1
bloody 1
war 1
thus 1
war 1
was 1
announced 1
to 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
all 1
fourfooted 1
animals 1
were 1
summoned 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
it 1
oxen 1
asses 1
cows 1
deer 1
and 1
every 1
other 1
animal 1
the 1
earth 1
contained 1
and 1
the 1
willowwren 1
summoned 1
everything 1
which 1
flew 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
not 1
only 1
birds 1
large 1
and 1
small 1
but 1
midges 1
and 1
hornets 1
bees 1
and 1
flies 1
had 1
to 1
come 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
the 1
war 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
willowwren 1
sent 1
out 1
spies 1
to 1
discover 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
enemys 1
commanderinchief 1
the 1
gnat 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
crafty 1
flew 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
the 1
enemy 1
was 1
assembled 1
and 1
hid 1
herself 1
beneath 1
a 1
leaf 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
the 1
password 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
announced 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
the 1
fox 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
fox 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
cunning 1
of 1
all 1
animals 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
general 1
and 1
lead 1
us 1
good 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
what 1
signal 1
shall 1
we 1
agree 1
upon 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
fine 1
long 1
bushy 1
tail 1
which 1
almost 1
looks 1
like 1
a 1
plume 1
of 1
red 1
feathers 1
when 1
i 1
lift 1
my 1
tail 1
up 1
quite 1
high 1
all 1
is 1
going 1
well 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
charge 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
let 1
it 1
hang 1
down 1
run 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
when 1
the 1
gnat 1
had 1
heard 1
that 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
revealed 1
everything 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
minutest 1
detail 1
to 1
the 1
willowwren 1
when 1
day 1
broke 1
and 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
to 1
begin 1
all 1
the 1
fourfooted 1
animals 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
noise 1
that 1
the 1
earth 1
trembled 1
the 1
willowwren 1
with 1
his 1
army 1
also 1
came 1
flying 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
humming 1
and 1
whirring 1
and 1
swarming 1
that 1
every 1
one 1
was 1
uneasy 1
and 1
afraid 1
and 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
they 1
advanced 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
but 1
the 1
willowwren 1
sent 1
down 1
the 1
hornet 1
with 1
orders 1
to 1
settle 1
beneath 1
the 1
foxs 1
tail 1
and 1
sting 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
when 1
the 1
fox 1
felt 1
the 1
first 1
string 1
he 1
started 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
lifted 1
one 1
leg 1
from 1
pain 1
but 1
he 1
bore 1
it 1
and 1
still 1
kept 1
his 1
tail 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
at 1
the 1
second 1
sting 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
the 1
third 1
he 1
could 1
hold 1
out 1
no 1
longer 1
screamed 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
tail 1
between 1
his 1
legs 1
when 1
the 1
animals 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
thought 1
all 1
was 1
lost 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
flee 1
each 1
into 1
his 1
hole 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
battle 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
flew 1
home 1
to 1
their 1
children 1
and 1
cried 1
children 1
rejoice 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
your 1
hearts 1
content 1
we 1
have 1
won 1
the 1
battle 1
but 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
eat 1
yet 1
the 1
bear 1
must 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
and 1
beg 1
for 1
pardon 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
honourable 1
children 1
before 1
we 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
then 1
the 1
willowwren 1
flew 1
to 1
the 1
bears 1
hole 1
and 1
cried 1
growler 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
to 1
my 1
children 1
and 1
beg 1
their 1
pardon 1
or 1
else 1
every 1
rib 1
of 1
your 1
body 1
shall 1
be 1
broken 1
so 1
the 1
bear 1
crept 1
thither 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
fear 1
and 1
begged 1
their 1
pardon 1
and 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
were 1
satisfied 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
together 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
made 1
merry 1
till 1
quite 1
late 1
into 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
frogprince 1
one 1
fine 1
evening 1
a 1
young 1
princess 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
bonnet 1
and 1
clogs 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
walk 1
by 1
herself 1
in 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
cool 1
spring 1
of 1
water 1
that 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
now 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
golden 1
ball 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
which 1
was 1
her 1
favourite 1
plaything 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
tossing 1
it 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
catching 1
it 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
fell 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
she 1
threw 1
it 1
up 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
she 1
missed 1
catching 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
fell 1
and 1
the 1
ball 1
bounded 1
away 1
and 1
rolled 1
along 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
the 1
princess 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
after 1
her 1
ball 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
deep 1
so 1
deep 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
bewail 1
her 1
loss 1
and 1
said 1
alas 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
get 1
my 1
ball 1
again 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
all 1
my 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
jewels 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
whilst 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
a 1
frog 1
put 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
said 1
princess 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
weep 1
so 1
bitterly 1
alas 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
nasty 1
frog 1
my 1
golden 1
ball 1
has 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
the 1
frog 1
said 1
i 1
want 1
not 1
your 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
and 1
fine 1
clothes 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
love 1
me 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
eat 1
from 1
off 1
your 1
golden 1
plate 1
and 1
sleep 1
upon 1
your 1
bed 1
i 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
your 1
ball 1
again 1
what 1
nonsense 1
thought 1
the 1
princess 1
this 1
silly 1
frog 1
is 1
talking 1
he 1
can 1
never 1
even 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
though 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
my 1
ball 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
therefore 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
him 1
he 1
shall 1
have 1
what 1
he 1
asks 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
frog 1
well 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
bring 1
me 1
my 1
ball 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
all 1
you 1
ask 1
then 1
the 1
frog 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
and 1
dived 1
deep 1
under 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
ball 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
young 1
princess 1
saw 1
her 1
ball 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
again 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
frog 1
but 1
ran 1
home 1
with 1
it 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
the 1
frog 1
called 1
after 1
her 1
stay 1
princess 1
and 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
said 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
to 1
hear 1
a 1
word 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
princess 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
dinner 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
strange 1
noisetap 1
tapplash 1
plashas 1
if 1
something 1
was 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
marble 1
staircase 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentle 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
voice 1
cried 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
and 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
by 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
then 1
the 1
princess 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
frog 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
at 1
this 1
sight 1
she 1
was 1
sadly 1
frightened 1
and 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
seat 1
the 1
king 1
her 1
father 1
seeing 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
frightened 1
her 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
nasty 1
frog 1
said 1
she 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
lifted 1
my 1
ball 1
for 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
with 1
me 1
here 1
thinking 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
never 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
but 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
the 1
frog 1
knocked 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
said 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
and 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
by 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
princess 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
your 1
word 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
it 1
so 1
go 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
the 1
frog 1
hopped 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
straight 1
ontap 1
tapplash 1
plashfrom 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
where 1
the 1
princess 1
sat 1
pray 1
lift 1
me 1
upon 1
chair 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
sit 1
next 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
this 1
the 1
frog 1
said 1
put 1
your 1
plate 1
nearer 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
this 1
she 1
did 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
he 1
said 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
carry 1
me 1
upstairs 1
and 1
put 1
me 1
into 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
though 1
very 1
unwilling 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
pillow 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
bed 1
where 1
he 1
slept 1
all 1
night 1
long 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
hopped 1
downstairs 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
now 1
then 1
thought 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
troubled 1
with 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
mistaken 1
for 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
same 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
frog 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
and 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
by 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
frog 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
upon 1
her 1
pillow 1
as 1
before 1
till 1
the 1
morning 1
broke 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
awoke 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
she 1
was 1
astonished 1
to 1
see 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
frog 1
a 1
handsome 1
prince 1
gazing 1
on 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
and 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
her 1
bed 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
enchanted 1
by 1
a 1
spiteful 1
fairy 1
who 1
had 1
changed 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
frog 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
fated 1
so 1
to 1
abide 1
till 1
some 1
princess 1
should 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
eat 1
from 1
her 1
plate 1
and 1
sleep 1
upon 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
three 1
nights 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
have 1
broken 1
his 1
cruel 1
charm 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
wish 1
for 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
my 1
fathers 1
kingdom 1
where 1
i 1
will 1
marry 1
you 1
and 1
love 1
you 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
live 1
the 1
young 1
princess 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
sure 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
in 1
saying 1
yes 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
spoke 1
a 1
gay 1
coach 1
drove 1
up 1
with 1
eight 1
beautiful 1
horses 1
decked 1
with 1
plumes 1
of 1
feathers 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
harness 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
coach 1
rode 1
the 1
princes 1
servant 1
faithful 1
heinrich 1
who 1
had 1
bewailed 1
the 1
misfortunes 1
of 1
his 1
dear 1
master 1
during 1
his 1
enchantment 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
so 1
bitterly 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
wellnigh 1
burst 1
they 1
then 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
coach 1
with 1
eight 1
horses 1
and 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
and 1
merriment 1
for 1
the 1
princes 1
kingdom 1
which 1
they 1
reached 1
safely 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
cat 1
and 1
mouse 1
in 1
partnership 1
a 1
certain 1
cat 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
a 1
mouse 1
and 1
had 1
said 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
her 1
about 1
the 1
great 1
love 1
and 1
friendship 1
she 1
felt 1
for 1
her 1
that 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
mouse 1
agreed 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
keep 1
house 1
together 1
but 1
we 1
must 1
make 1
a 1
provision 1
for 1
winter 1
or 1
else 1
we 1
shall 1
suffer 1
from 1
hunger 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
and 1
you 1
little 1
mouse 1
cannot 1
venture 1
everywhere 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
some 1
day 1
the 1
good 1
advice 1
was 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
was 1
bought 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
at 1
length 1
after 1
much 1
consideration 1
the 1
cat 1
said 1
i 1
know 1
no 1
place 1
where 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
stored 1
up 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
for 1
no 1
one 1
dares 1
take 1
anything 1
away 1
from 1
there 1
we 1
will 1
set 1
it 1
beneath 1
the 1
altar 1
and 1
not 1
touch 1
it 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
really 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
so 1
the 1
pot 1
was 1
placed 1
in 1
safety 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
cat 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
yearning 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
little 1
mouse 1
my 1
cousin 1
has 1
brought 1
a 1
little 1
son 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
has 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
he 1
is 1
white 1
with 1
brown 1
spots 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
font 1
at 1
the 1
christening 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
out 1
today 1
and 1
you 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
house 1
by 1
yourself 1
yes 1
yes 1
answered 1
the 1
mouse 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
go 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
get 1
anything 1
very 1
good 1
to 1
eat 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
a 1
drop 1
of 1
sweet 1
red 1
christening 1
wine 1
myself 1
all 1
this 1
however 1
was 1
untrue 1
the 1
cat 1
had 1
no 1
cousin 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
stole 1
to 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
began 1
to 1
lick 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
licked 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
fat 1
off 1
then 1
she 1
took 1
a 1
walk 1
upon 1
the 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
looked 1
out 1
for 1
opportunities 1
and 1
then 1
stretched 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
licked 1
her 1
lips 1
whenever 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
and 1
not 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
evening 1
did 1
she 1
return 1
home 1
well 1
here 1
you 1
are 1
again 1
said 1
the 1
mouse 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
merry 1
day 1
all 1
went 1
off 1
well 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
what 1
name 1
did 1
they 1
give 1
the 1
child 1
top 1
off 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
quite 1
coolly 1
top 1
off 1
cried 1
the 1
mouse 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
odd 1
and 1
uncommon 1
name 1
is 1
it 1
a 1
usual 1
one 1
in 1
your 1
family 1
what 1
does 1
that 1
matter 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
worse 1
than 1
crumbstealer 1
as 1
your 1
godchildren 1
are 1
called 1
before 1
long 1
the 1
cat 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
another 1
fit 1
of 1
yearning 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
favour 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
manage 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
alone 1
i 1
am 1
again 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
a 1
white 1
ring 1
round 1
its 1
neck 1
i 1
cannot 1
refuse 1
the 1
good 1
mouse 1
consented 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
crept 1
behind 1
the 1
town 1
walls 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
devoured 1
half 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
nothing 1
ever 1
seems 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
what 1
one 1
keeps 1
to 1
oneself 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
satisfied 1
with 1
her 1
days 1
work 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
home 1
the 1
mouse 1
inquired 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
child 1
christened 1
halfdone 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
halfdone 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
saying 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
the 1
name 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
ill 1
wager 1
anything 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
calendar 1
the 1
cats 1
mouth 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
water 1
for 1
some 1
more 1
licking 1
all 1
good 1
things 1
go 1
in 1
threes 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
asked 1
to 1
stand 1
godmother 1
again 1
the 1
child 1
is 1
quite 1
black 1
only 1
it 1
has 1
white 1
paws 1
but 1
with 1
that 1
exception 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
white 1
hair 1
on 1
its 1
whole 1
body 1
this 1
only 1
happens 1
once 1
every 1
few 1
years 1
you 1
will 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
wont 1
you 1
topoff 1
halfdone 1
answered 1
the 1
mouse 1
they 1
are 1
such 1
odd 1
names 1
they 1
make 1
me 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
you 1
sit 1
at 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
in 1
your 1
darkgrey 1
fur 1
coat 1
and 1
long 1
tail 1
and 1
are 1
filled 1
with 1
fancies 1
thats 1
because 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
during 1
the 1
cats 1
absence 1
the 1
mouse 1
cleaned 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
but 1
the 1
greedy 1
cat 1
entirely 1
emptied 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
when 1
everything 1
is 1
eaten 1
up 1
one 1
has 1
some 1
peace 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
and 1
well 1
filled 1
and 1
fat 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
home 1
till 1
night 1
the 1
mouse 1
at 1
once 1
asked 1
what 1
name 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
third 1
child 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
please 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
others 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
he 1
is 1
called 1
allgone 1
allgone 1
cried 1
the 1
mouse 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
suspicious 1
name 1
of 1
all 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
print 1
allgone 1
what 1
can 1
that 1
mean 1
and 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
curled 1
herself 1
up 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
forth 1
no 1
one 1
invited 1
the 1
cat 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
winter 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
anything 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
outside 1
the 1
mouse 1
thought 1
of 1
their 1
provision 1
and 1
said 1
come 1
cat 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
our 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
stored 1
up 1
for 1
ourselveswe 1
shall 1
enjoy 1
that 1
yes 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
you 1
will 1
enjoy 1
it 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
would 1
enjoy 1
sticking 1
that 1
dainty 1
tongue 1
of 1
yours 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
certainly 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
its 1
place 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
empty 1
alas 1
said 1
the 1
mouse 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
now 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
light 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
true 1
friend 1
you 1
have 1
devoured 1
all 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
standing 1
godmother 1
first 1
top 1
off 1
then 1
halfdone 1
then 1
will 1
you 1
hold 1
your 1
tongue 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
one 1
word 1
more 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
you 1
too 1
allgone 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
poor 1
mouses 1
lips 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
spoken 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
cat 1
sprang 1
on 1
her 1
seized 1
her 1
and 1
swallowed 1
her 1
down 1
verily 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
goosegirl 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
land 1
died 1
and 1
left 1
his 1
queen 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
their 1
only 1
child 1
this 1
child 1
was 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
and 1
her 1
mother 1
loved 1
her 1
dearly 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
fairy 1
too 1
who 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
helped 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
grew 1
up 1
she 1
was 1
betrothed 1
to 1
a 1
prince 1
who 1
lived 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
drew 1
near 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
she 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
set 1
off 1
on 1
her 1
journey 1
to 1
his 1
country 1
then 1
the 1
queen 1
her 1
mother 1
packed 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
costly 1
things 1
jewels 1
and 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
trinkets 1
fine 1
dresses 1
and 1
in 1
short 1
everything 1
that 1
became 1
a 1
royal 1
bride 1
and 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
waitingmaid 1
to 1
ride 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
give 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
bridegrooms 1
hands 1
and 1
each 1
had 1
a 1
horse 1
for 1
the 1
journey 1
now 1
the 1
princesss 1
horse 1
was 1
the 1
fairys 1
gift 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
falada 1
and 1
could 1
speak 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
fairy 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
bedchamber 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
little 1
knife 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
lock 1
of 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
said 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
it 1
dear 1
child 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
charm 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
took 1
a 1
sorrowful 1
leave 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
into 1
her 1
bosom 1
got 1
upon 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
on 1
her 1
journey 1
to 1
her 1
bridegrooms 1
kingdom 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
riding 1
along 1
by 1
a 1
brook 1
the 1
princess 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
very 1
thirsty 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
pray 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
in 1
my 1
golden 1
cup 1
out 1
of 1
yonder 1
brook 1
for 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
drink 1
nay 1
said 1
the 1
maid 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
thirsty 1
get 1
off 1
yourself 1
and 1
stoop 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
drink 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
your 1
waitingmaid 1
any 1
longer 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
thirsty 1
that 1
she 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
knelt 1
over 1
the 1
little 1
brook 1
and 1
drank 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
bring 1
out 1
her 1
golden 1
cup 1
and 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
said 1
alas 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
lock 1
answered 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
very 1
gentle 1
and 1
meek 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
to 1
her 1
maids 1
ill 1
behaviour 1
but 1
got 1
upon 1
her 1
horse 1
again 1
then 1
all 1
rode 1
farther 1
on 1
their 1
journey 1
till 1
the 1
day 1
grew 1
so 1
warm 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
so 1
scorching 1
that 1
the 1
bride 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
very 1
thirsty 1
again 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
river 1
she 1
forgot 1
her 1
maids 1
rude 1
speech 1
and 1
said 1
pray 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
my 1
golden 1
cup 1
but 1
the 1
maid 1
answered 1
her 1
and 1
even 1
spoke 1
more 1
haughtily 1
than 1
before 1
drink 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
your 1
waitingmaid 1
then 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
so 1
thirsty 1
that 1
she 1
got 1
off 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
held 1
her 1
head 1
over 1
the 1
running 1
stream 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
answered 1
her 1
again 1
alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
leaned 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
bosom 1
and 1
floated 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
water 1
now 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
her 1
maid 1
saw 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
for 1
she 1
knew 1
the 1
charm 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
bride 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
her 1
power 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
hair 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
bride 1
had 1
done 1
drinking 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
got 1
upon 1
falada 1
again 1
the 1
maid 1
said 1
i 1
shall 1
ride 1
upon 1
falada 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
my 1
horse 1
instead 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
her 1
royal 1
clothes 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
maids 1
shabby 1
ones 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
they 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
their 1
journey 1
this 1
treacherous 1
servant 1
threatened 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
mistress 1
if 1
she 1
ever 1
told 1
anyone 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
falada 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
marked 1
it 1
well 1
then 1
the 1
waitingmaid 1
got 1
upon 1
falada 1
and 1
the 1
real 1
bride 1
rode 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
horse 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
court 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
joy 1
at 1
their 1
coming 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
flew 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
and 1
lifted 1
the 1
maid 1
from 1
her 1
horse 1
thinking 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
upstairs 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
chamber 1
but 1
the 1
true 1
princess 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
below 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
happened 1
just 1
then 1
to 1
have 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
amused 1
himself 1
by 1
sitting 1
at 1
his 1
kitchen 1
window 1
looking 1
at 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
as 1
she 1
looked 1
very 1
pretty 1
and 1
too 1
delicate 1
for 1
a 1
waitingmaid 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
royal 1
chamber 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
bride 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
that 1
was 1
thus 1
left 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
below 1
i 1
brought 1
her 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
her 1
company 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
said 1
she 1
pray 1
give 1
the 1
girl 1
some 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
she 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
idle 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
could 1
not 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
work 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
lad 1
who 1
takes 1
care 1
of 1
my 1
geese 1
she 1
may 1
go 1
and 1
help 1
him 1
now 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
lad 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
bride 1
was 1
to 1
help 1
in 1
watching 1
the 1
kings 1
geese 1
was 1
curdken 1
but 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
prince 1
dear 1
husband 1
pray 1
do 1
me 1
one 1
piece 1
of 1
kindness 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
then 1
tell 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
slaughterers 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
horse 1
i 1
rode 1
upon 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
unruly 1
and 1
plagued 1
me 1
sadly 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
but 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
afraid 1
lest 1
falada 1
should 1
some 1
day 1
or 1
other 1
speak 1
and 1
tell 1
all 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
she 1
carried 1
her 1
point 1
and 1
the 1
faithful 1
falada 1
was 1
killed 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
true 1
princess 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
begged 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
nail 1
up 1
faladas 1
head 1
against 1
a 1
large 1
dark 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
evening 1
that 1
there 1
she 1
might 1
still 1
see 1
him 1
sometimes 1
then 1
the 1
slaughterer 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
she 1
wished 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
nailed 1
it 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
as 1
she 1
and 1
curdken 1
went 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
gate 1
she 1
said 1
sorrowfully 1
falada 1
falada 1
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answered 1
bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
geese 1
on 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
bank 1
there 1
and 1
let 1
down 1
her 1
waving 1
locks 1
of 1
hair 1
which 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
pure 1
silver 1
and 1
when 1
curdken 1
saw 1
it 1
glitter 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
he 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
pulled 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
locks 1
out 1
but 1
she 1
cried 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
curdkens 1
hat 1
go 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
oer 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
away 1
be 1
it 1
whirld 1
till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
are 1
all 1
combd 1
and 1
curld 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
wind 1
so 1
strong 1
that 1
it 1
blew 1
off 1
curdkens 1
hat 1
and 1
away 1
it 1
flew 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
turn 1
and 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
till 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
combing 1
and 1
curling 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
had 1
put 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
safe 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
sulky 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
watched 1
the 1
geese 1
until 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
them 1
homewards 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
faladas 1
head 1
and 1
cried 1
falada 1
falada 1
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answered 1
bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
drove 1
on 1
the 1
geese 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
meadow 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
comb 1
out 1
her 1
hair 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
curdken 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
quickly 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
curdkens 1
hat 1
go 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
oer 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
away 1
be 1
it 1
whirld 1
till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
are 1
all 1
combd 1
and 1
curld 1
then 1
the 1
wind 1
came 1
and 1
blew 1
away 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
off 1
it 1
flew 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
she 1
had 1
bound 1
up 1
her 1
hair 1
again 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
safe 1
so 1
they 1
watched 1
the 1
geese 1
till 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
after 1
they 1
came 1
home 1
curdken 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
cannot 1
have 1
that 1
strange 1
girl 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
geese 1
any 1
longer 1
why 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
because 1
instead 1
of 1
doing 1
any 1
good 1
she 1
does 1
nothing 1
but 1
tease 1
me 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
him 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
curdken 1
said 1
when 1
we 1
go 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
with 1
our 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
she 1
cries 1
and 1
talks 1
with 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
hangs 1
upon 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
says 1
falada 1
falada 1
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answers 1
bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
and 1
curdken 1
went 1
on 1
telling 1
the 1
king 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
upon 1
the 1
meadow 1
where 1
the 1
geese 1
fed 1
how 1
his 1
hat 1
was 1
blown 1
away 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
to 1
themselves 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
told 1
the 1
boy 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
when 1
morning 1
came 1
he 1
placed 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
and 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
spoke 1
to 1
falada 1
and 1
how 1
falada 1
answered 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
bush 1
by 1
the 1
meadows 1
side 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
saw 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
how 1
they 1
drove 1
the 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
and 1
how 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
she 1
let 1
down 1
her 1
hair 1
that 1
glittered 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
heard 1
her 1
say 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
curdkens 1
hat 1
go 1
blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
oer 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
away 1
be 1
it 1
whirld 1
till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
are 1
all 1
combd 1
and 1
curld 1
and 1
soon 1
came 1
a 1
gale 1
of 1
wind 1
and 1
carried 1
away 1
curdkens 1
hat 1
and 1
away 1
went 1
curdken 1
after 1
it 1
while 1
the 1
girl 1
went 1
on 1
combing 1
and 1
curling 1
her 1
hair 1
all 1
this 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
saw 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
goosegirl 1
came 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
called 1
her 1
aside 1
and 1
asked 1
her 1
why 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
but 1
she 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
or 1
any 1
man 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
lose 1
my 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
peace 1
till 1
she 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
tale 1
from 1
beginning 1
to 1
end 1
word 1
for 1
word 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
lucky 1
for 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
for 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
royal 1
clothes 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
gazed 1
on 1
her 1
with 1
wonder 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
then 1
he 1
called 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
a 1
false 1
bride 1
for 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
merely 1
a 1
waitingmaid 1
while 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
stood 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
rejoiced 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
beauty 1
and 1
heard 1
how 1
meek 1
and 1
patient 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
anything 1
to 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
ready 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
court 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
with 1
the 1
false 1
princess 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
again 1
for 1
her 1
beauty 1
was 1
quite 1
dazzling 1
to 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
at 1
all 1
like 1
the 1
little 1
goosegirl 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
her 1
brilliant 1
dress 1
on 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
were 1
very 1
merry 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
them 1
a 1
tale 1
so 1
he 1
began 1
and 1
told 1
all 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
heard 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
true 1
waitingmaid 1
what 1
she 1
thought 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
anyone 1
who 1
would 1
behave 1
thus 1
nothing 1
better 1
said 1
this 1
false 1
bride 1
than 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
thrown 1
into 1
a 1
cask 1
stuck 1
round 1
with 1
sharp 1
nails 1
and 1
that 1
two 1
white 1
horses 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
should 1
drag 1
it 1
from 1
street 1
to 1
street 1
till 1
she 1
was 1
dead 1
thou 1
art 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
and 1
as 1
thou 1
has 1
judged 1
thyself 1
so 1
shall 1
it 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
thee 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
was 1
then 1
married 1
to 1
his 1
true 1
wife 1
and 1
they 1
reigned 1
over 1
the 1
kingdom 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
happiness 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
restored 1
the 1
faithful 1
falada 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
the 1
adventures 1
of 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
partlet 1
1 1
how 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
to 1
eat 1
nuts 1
the 1
nuts 1
are 1
quite 1
ripe 1
now 1
said 1
chanticleer 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
partlet 1
suppose 1
we 1
go 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
eat 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
before 1
the 1
squirrel 1
takes 1
them 1
all 1
away 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
partlet 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
holiday 1
of 1
it 1
together 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
day 1
they 1
stayed 1
there 1
till 1
the 1
evening 1
now 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
many 1
nuts 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
walk 1
or 1
whether 1
they 1
were 1
lazy 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
however 1
they 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
their 1
heads 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
become 1
them 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
on 1
foot 1
so 1
chanticleer 1
began 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
little 1
carriage 1
of 1
nutshells 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
finished 1
partlet 1
jumped 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
bid 1
chanticleer 1
harness 1
himself 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
draw 1
her 1
home 1
thats 1
a 1
good 1
joke 1
said 1
chanticleer 1
no 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
do 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
by 1
half 1
walk 1
home 1
ill 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
be 1
coachman 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
but 1
ill 1
not 1
draw 1
while 1
this 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
duck 1
came 1
quacking 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
you 1
thieving 1
vagabonds 1
what 1
business 1
have 1
you 1
in 1
my 1
grounds 1
ill 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
well 1
for 1
your 1
insolence 1
and 1
upon 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
upon 1
chanticleer 1
most 1
lustily 1
but 1
chanticleer 1
was 1
no 1
coward 1
and 1
returned 1
the 1
ducks 1
blows 1
with 1
his 1
sharp 1
spurs 1
so 1
fiercely 1
that 1
she 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
for 1
mercy 1
which 1
was 1
only 1
granted 1
her 1
upon 1
condition 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
draw 1
the 1
carriage 1
home 1
for 1
them 1
this 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
chanticleer 1
got 1
upon 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
drove 1
crying 1
now 1
duck 1
get 1
on 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
at 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
pace 1
after 1
they 1
had 1
travelled 1
along 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
they 1
met 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
a 1
pin 1
walking 1
together 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
needle 1
cried 1
out 1
stop 1
stop 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
dark 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
hardly 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
and 1
such 1
dirty 1
walking 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
on 1
at 1
all 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
pin 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
a 1
publichouse 1
a 1
few 1
miles 1
off 1
and 1
had 1
sat 1
drinking 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
forgotten 1
how 1
late 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
begged 1
therefore 1
that 1
the 1
travellers 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
lift 1
in 1
their 1
carriage 1
chanticleer 1
observing 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
but 1
thin 1
fellows 1
and 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
much 1
room 1
told 1
them 1
they 1
might 1
ride 1
but 1
made 1
them 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
dirty 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
in 1
getting 1
in 1
nor 1
to 1
tread 1
on 1
partlets 1
toes 1
late 1
at 1
night 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
an 1
inn 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
bad 1
travelling 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
duck 1
seemed 1
much 1
tired 1
and 1
waddled 1
about 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
from 1
one 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
made 1
up 1
their 1
minds 1
to 1
fix 1
their 1
quarters 1
there 1
but 1
the 1
landlord 1
at 1
first 1
was 1
unwilling 1
and 1
said 1
his 1
house 1
was 1
full 1
thinking 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
respectable 1
company 1
however 1
they 1
spoke 1
civilly 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
egg 1
which 1
partlet 1
had 1
laid 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
duck 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
laying 1
one 1
every 1
day 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
them 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
bespoke 1
a 1
handsome 1
supper 1
and 1
spent 1
the 1
evening 1
very 1
jollily 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
light 1
and 1
when 1
nobody 1
was 1
stirring 1
in 1
the 1
inn 1
chanticleer 1
awakened 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
fetching 1
the 1
egg 1
they 1
pecked 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
it 1
ate 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
threw 1
the 1
shells 1
into 1
the 1
fireplace 1
they 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
pin 1
and 1
needle 1
who 1
were 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
seizing 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
heads 1
stuck 1
one 1
into 1
the 1
landlords 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
into 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
having 1
done 1
this 1
they 1
crept 1
away 1
as 1
softly 1
as 1
possible 1
however 1
the 1
duck 1
who 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
heard 1
them 1
coming 1
and 1
jumping 1
into 1
the 1
brook 1
which 1
ran 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
inn 1
soon 1
swam 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
reach 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
afterwards 1
the 1
landlord 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
to 1
wipe 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
the 1
pin 1
ran 1
into 1
him 1
and 1
pricked 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
light 1
his 1
pipe 1
at 1
the 1
fire 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
stirred 1
it 1
up 1
the 1
eggshells 1
flew 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
almost 1
blinded 1
him 1
bless 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
design 1
against 1
my 1
head 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
sulkily 1
into 1
his 1
easy 1
chair 1
but 1
oh 1
dear 1
the 1
needle 1
ran 1
into 1
him 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
pain 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
he 1
now 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
passion 1
and 1
suspecting 1
the 1
company 1
who 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
off 1
so 1
he 1
swore 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
again 1
would 1
take 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
vagabonds 1
who 1
ate 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
paid 1
no 1
reckoning 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
nothing 1
for 1
his 1
trouble 1
but 1
their 1
apish 1
tricks 1
2 1
how 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
partlet 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
mr 1
korbes 1
another 1
day 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
partlet 1
wished 1
to 1
ride 1
out 1
together 1
so 1
chanticleer 1
built 1
a 1
handsome 1
carriage 1
with 1
four 1
red 1
wheels 1
and 1
harnessed 1
six 1
mice 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
and 1
partlet 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
drove 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
a 1
cat 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
and 1
chanticleer 1
replied 1
all 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
pay 1
to 1
mr 1
korbes 1
the 1
fox 1
today 1
then 1
the 1
cat 1
said 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
chanticleer 1
said 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
get 1
up 1
behind 1
and 1
be 1
sure 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
fall 1
off 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
this 1
handsome 1
coach 1
of 1
mine 1
nor 1
dirty 1
my 1
pretty 1
red 1
wheels 1
so 1
fine 1
now 1
mice 1
be 1
ready 1
and 1
wheels 1
run 1
steady 1
for 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
pay 1
to 1
mr 1
korbes 1
the 1
fox 1
today 1
soon 1
after 1
came 1
up 1
a 1
millstone 1
an 1
egg 1
a 1
duck 1
and 1
a 1
pin 1
and 1
chanticleer 1
gave 1
them 1
all 1
leave 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
go 1
with 1
them 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
mr 1
korbess 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
so 1
the 1
mice 1
drew 1
the 1
carriage 1
into 1
the 1
coachhouse 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
partlet 1
flew 1
upon 1
a 1
beam 1
the 1
cat 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
fireplace 1
the 1
duck 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
washing 1
cistern 1
the 1
pin 1
stuck 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
bed 1
pillow 1
the 1
millstone 1
laid 1
himself 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
egg 1
rolled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
when 1
mr 1
korbes 1
came 1
home 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
fireplace 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
fire 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
threw 1
all 1
the 1
ashes 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
so 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
wash 1
himself 1
but 1
there 1
the 1
duck 1
splashed 1
all 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
wipe 1
himself 1
the 1
egg 1
broke 1
to 1
pieces 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
all 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
eyes 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
went 1
without 1
his 1
supper 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
laid 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
the 1
pillow 1
the 1
pin 1
ran 1
into 1
his 1
cheek 1
at 1
this 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
furious 1
and 1
jumping 1
up 1
would 1
have 1
run 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
millstone 1
fell 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
3 1
how 1
partlet 1
died 1
and 1
was 1
buried 1
and 1
how 1
chanticleer 1
died 1
of 1
grief 1
another 1
day 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
partlet 1
agreed 1
to 1
go 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
to 1
eat 1
nuts 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
nuts 1
which 1
they 1
found 1
should 1
be 1
shared 1
equally 1
between 1
them 1
now 1
partlet 1
found 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
nut 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
to 1
chanticleer 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
herself 1
however 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
swallow 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
stuck 1
in 1
her 1
throat 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
fright 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
chanticleer 1
pray 1
run 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
choked 1
chanticleer 1
ran 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
said 1
river 1
give 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
for 1
partlet 1
lies 1
in 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
choked 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
nut 1
the 1
river 1
said 1
run 1
first 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
ask 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
the 1
water 1
chanticleer 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
said 1
bride 1
you 1
must 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
for 1
then 1
the 1
river 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
will 1
carry 1
to 1
partlet 1
who 1
lies 1
on 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
choked 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
nut 1
but 1
the 1
bride 1
said 1
run 1
first 1
and 1
bring 1
me 1
my 1
garland 1
that 1
is 1
hanging 1
on 1
a 1
willow 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
then 1
chanticleer 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
garland 1
from 1
the 1
bough 1
where 1
it 1
hung 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
bride 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
silken 1
cord 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
silken 1
cord 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
gave 1
him 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
partlet 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
she 1
was 1
choked 1
by 1
the 1
great 1
nut 1
and 1
lay 1
quite 1
dead 1
and 1
never 1
moved 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
chanticleer 1
was 1
very 1
sorry 1
and 1
cried 1
bitterly 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
came 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
him 1
over 1
poor 1
partlet 1
and 1
six 1
mice 1
built 1
a 1
little 1
hearse 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
to 1
her 1
grave 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
they 1
harnessed 1
themselves 1
before 1
it 1
and 1
chanticleer 1
drove 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
chanticleer 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
bury 1
my 1
partlet 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
may 1
i 1
go 1
with 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
get 1
up 1
behind 1
or 1
my 1
horses 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
draw 1
you 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
got 1
up 1
behind 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
wolf 1
the 1
bear 1
the 1
goat 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
came 1
and 1
climbed 1
upon 1
the 1
hearse 1
so 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
rapid 1
stream 1
how 1
shall 1
we 1
get 1
over 1
said 1
chanticleer 1
then 1
said 1
a 1
straw 1
i 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
across 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
pass 1
over 1
upon 1
me 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
mice 1
were 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
straw 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
six 1
mice 1
all 1
fell 1
in 1
and 1
were 1
drowned 1
what 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
then 1
a 1
large 1
log 1
of 1
wood 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
big 1
enough 1
i 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
across 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
pass 1
over 1
upon 1
me 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
but 1
they 1
managed 1
so 1
clumsily 1
that 1
the 1
log 1
of 1
wood 1
fell 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
then 1
a 1
stone 1
who 1
saw 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
kindly 1
offered 1
to 1
help 1
poor 1
chanticleer 1
by 1
laying 1
himself 1
across 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
safely 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
with 1
the 1
hearse 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
partlet 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
mourners 1
who 1
were 1
sitting 1
behind 1
were 1
too 1
heavy 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
were 1
all 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
drowned 1
thus 1
chanticleer 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
with 1
his 1
dead 1
partlet 1
and 1
having 1
dug 1
a 1
grave 1
for 1
her 1
he 1
laid 1
her 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
hillock 1
over 1
her 1
then 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
mourned 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
died 1
too 1
and 1
so 1
all 1
were 1
dead 1
rapunzel 1
there 1
were 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
long 1
in 1
vain 1
wished 1
for 1
a 1
child 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
woman 1
hoped 1
that 1
god 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
grant 1
her 1
desire 1
these 1
people 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
their 1
house 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
splendid 1
garden 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
flowers 1
and 1
herbs 1
it 1
was 1
however 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
high 1
wall 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
dared 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
an 1
enchantress 1
who 1
had 1
great 1
power 1
and 1
was 1
dreaded 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
this 1
window 1
and 1
looking 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
bed 1
which 1
was 1
planted 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
rampion 1
rapunzel 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
so 1
fresh 1
and 1
green 1
that 1
she 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
she 1
quite 1
pined 1
away 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
pale 1
and 1
miserable 1
then 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
alarmed 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
ails 1
you 1
dear 1
wife 1
ah 1
she 1
replied 1
if 1
i 1
cant 1
eat 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rampion 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
our 1
house 1
i 1
shall 1
die 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
loved 1
her 1
thought 1
sooner 1
than 1
let 1
your 1
wife 1
die 1
bring 1
her 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rampion 1
yourself 1
let 1
it 1
cost 1
what 1
it 1
will 1
at 1
twilight 1
he 1
clambered 1
down 1
over 1
the 1
wall 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
the 1
enchantress 1
hastily 1
clutched 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
rampion 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
she 1
at 1
once 1
made 1
herself 1
a 1
salad 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
greedily 1
it 1
tasted 1
so 1
good 1
to 1
herso 1
very 1
good 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
she 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
three 1
times 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
before 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
rest 1
her 1
husband 1
must 1
once 1
more 1
descend 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
of 1
evening 1
therefore 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
down 1
again 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
clambered 1
down 1
the 1
wall 1
he 1
was 1
terribly 1
afraid 1
for 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
enchantress 1
standing 1
before 1
him 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
dare 1
said 1
she 1
with 1
angry 1
look 1
descend 1
into 1
my 1
garden 1
and 1
steal 1
my 1
rampion 1
like 1
a 1
thief 1
you 1
shall 1
suffer 1
for 1
it 1
ah 1
answered 1
he 1
let 1
mercy 1
take 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
justice 1
i 1
only 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
necessity 1
my 1
wife 1
saw 1
your 1
rampion 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
felt 1
such 1
a 1
longing 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
died 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
some 1
to 1
eat 1
then 1
the 1
enchantress 1
allowed 1
her 1
anger 1
to 1
be 1
softened 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
if 1
the 1
case 1
be 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
i 1
will 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
much 1
rampion 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
i 1
make 1
one 1
condition 1
you 1
must 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
child 1
which 1
your 1
wife 1
will 1
bring 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
well 1
treated 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
mother 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
his 1
terror 1
consented 1
to 1
everything 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
enchantress 1
appeared 1
at 1
once 1
gave 1
the 1
child 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
rapunzel 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
rapunzel 1
grew 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
child 1
under 1
the 1
sun 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
twelve 1
years 1
old 1
the 1
enchantress 1
shut 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
tower 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
had 1
neither 1
stairs 1
nor 1
door 1
but 1
quite 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
window 1
when 1
the 1
enchantress 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
she 1
placed 1
herself 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
cried 1
rapunzel 1
rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
rapunzel 1
had 1
magnificent 1
long 1
hair 1
fine 1
as 1
spun 1
gold 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
enchantress 1
she 1
unfastened 1
her 1
braided 1
tresses 1
wound 1
them 1
round 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hooks 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
above 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
hair 1
fell 1
twenty 1
ells 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
enchantress 1
climbed 1
up 1
by 1
it 1
after 1
a 1
year 1
or 1
two 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
rode 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
tower 1
then 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
song 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
charming 1
that 1
he 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
this 1
was 1
rapunzel 1
who 1
in 1
her 1
solitude 1
passed 1
her 1
time 1
in 1
letting 1
her 1
sweet 1
voice 1
resound 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
wanted 1
to 1
climb 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
tower 1
but 1
none 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
he 1
rode 1
home 1
but 1
the 1
singing 1
had 1
so 1
deeply 1
touched 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
it 1
once 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
standing 1
behind 1
a 1
tree 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
an 1
enchantress 1
came 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
cried 1
rapunzel 1
rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
the 1
braids 1
of 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
the 1
enchantress 1
climbed 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
ladder 1
by 1
which 1
one 1
mounts 1
i 1
too 1
will 1
try 1
my 1
fortune 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
dark 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
cried 1
rapunzel 1
rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
immediately 1
the 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
climbed 1
up 1
at 1
first 1
rapunzel 1
was 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
such 1
as 1
her 1
eyes 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
beheld 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
her 1
quite 1
like 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
stirred 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
then 1
rapunzel 1
lost 1
her 1
fear 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
handsome 1
she 1
thought 1
he 1
will 1
love 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
old 1
dame 1
gothel 1
does 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
yes 1
and 1
laid 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
willingly 1
go 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
bring 1
with 1
you 1
a 1
skein 1
of 1
silk 1
every 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
weave 1
a 1
ladder 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
that 1
is 1
ready 1
i 1
will 1
descend 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
horse 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
until 1
that 1
time 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
every 1
evening 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
by 1
day 1
the 1
enchantress 1
remarked 1
nothing 1
of 1
this 1
until 1
once 1
rapunzel 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
tell 1
me 1
dame 1
gothel 1
how 1
it 1
happens 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
much 1
heavier 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
than 1
the 1
young 1
kings 1
sonhe 1
is 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
ah 1
you 1
wicked 1
child 1
cried 1
the 1
enchantress 1
what 1
do 1
i 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
had 1
separated 1
you 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
have 1
deceived 1
me 1
in 1
her 1
anger 1
she 1
clutched 1
rapunzels 1
beautiful 1
tresses 1
wrapped 1
them 1
twice 1
round 1
her 1
left 1
hand 1
seized 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
scissors 1
with 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
snip 1
snap 1
they 1
were 1
cut 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
braids 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
pitiless 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
poor 1
rapunzel 1
into 1
a 1
desert 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
misery 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
that 1
she 1
cast 1
out 1
rapunzel 1
however 1
the 1
enchantress 1
fastened 1
the 1
braids 1
of 1
hair 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
hook 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
came 1
and 1
cried 1
rapunzel 1
rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
let 1
the 1
hair 1
down 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
ascended 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
finding 1
his 1
dearest 1
rapunzel 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
enchantress 1
who 1
gazed 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
wicked 1
and 1
venomous 1
looks 1
aha 1
she 1
cried 1
mockingly 1
you 1
would 1
fetch 1
your 1
dearest 1
but 1
the 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
sits 1
no 1
longer 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
nest 1
the 1
cat 1
has 1
got 1
it 1
and 1
will 1
scratch 1
out 1
your 1
eyes 1
as 1
well 1
rapunzel 1
is 1
lost 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
again 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
was 1
beside 1
himself 1
with 1
pain 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
despair 1
he 1
leapt 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
tower 1
he 1
escaped 1
with 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
thorns 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
fell 1
pierced 1
his 1
eyes 1
then 1
he 1
wandered 1
quite 1
blind 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
ate 1
nothing 1
but 1
roots 1
and 1
berries 1
and 1
did 1
naught 1
but 1
lament 1
and 1
weep 1
over 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
dearest 1
wife 1
thus 1
he 1
roamed 1
about 1
in 1
misery 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
desert 1
where 1
rapunzel 1
with 1
the 1
twins 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
birth 1
a 1
boy 1
and 1
a 1
girl 1
lived 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
voice 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
so 1
familiar 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
approached 1
rapunzel 1
knew 1
him 1
and 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
wept 1
two 1
of 1
her 1
tears 1
wetted 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
they 1
grew 1
clear 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
before 1
he 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
joyfully 1
received 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
afterwards 1
happy 1
and 1
contented 1
fundevogel 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
forester 1
who 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
hunt 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
it 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
of 1
screaming 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
were 1
there 1
he 1
followed 1
the 1
sound 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
high 1
tree 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
was 1
sitting 1
for 1
the 1
mother 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
a 1
bird 1
of 1
prey 1
had 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
had 1
flown 1
down 1
snatched 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
high 1
tree 1
the 1
forester 1
climbed 1
up 1
brought 1
the 1
child 1
down 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
him 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
up 1
with 1
your 1
lina 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
home 1
therefore 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
grew 1
up 1
together 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
was 1
called 1
fundevogel 1
because 1
a 1
bird 1
had 1
carried 1
it 1
away 1
fundevogel 1
and 1
lina 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
dearly 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
were 1
sad 1
now 1
the 1
forester 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
one 1
evening 1
took 1
two 1
pails 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
fetch 1
water 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
once 1
only 1
but 1
many 1
times 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
lina 1

and 1
said 1

never 1
repeat 1
it 1
to 1
anyone 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
why 1
so 1
lina 1
said 1
no 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
repeat 1
it 1
to 1
anyone 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1

when 1
the 1
forester 1
is 1
out 1
hunting 1
i 1

and 1

boil 1
him 1
in 1
it 1
early 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
forester 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
hunting 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
still 1
in 1
bed 1
then 1
lina 1
said 1
to 1
fundevogel 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
i 1
too 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
fundevogel 1
said 1
neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
will 1
i 1
leave 1
you 1
then 1
said 1
lina 1
then 1
will 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
last 1
night 1
old 1
sanna 1
carried 1
so 1
many 1
buckets 1
of 1
water 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
that 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
why 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
that 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anyone 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
early 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
when 1
father 1
was 1
out 1
hunting 1
she 1
would 1
set 1
the 1
kettle 1
full 1
of 1
water 1
throw 1
you 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
boil 1
you 1
but 1
we 1
will 1
get 1
up 1
quickly 1
dress 1
ourselves 1
and 1
go 1
away 1
together 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
therefore 1
got 1
up 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
quickly 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
when 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
the 1
kettle 1
was 1
boiling 1
the 1
cook 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
to 1
fetch 1
fundevogel 1
and 1
throw 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
beds 1
both 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
gone 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
terribly 1
alarmed 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
say 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
forester 1
comes 1
home 1
and 1
sees 1
that 1
the 1
children 1
are 1
gone 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
followed 1
instantly 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
back 1
again 1
then 1
the 1
cook 1
sent 1
three 1
servants 1
after 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
overtake 1
the 1
children 1
the 1
children 1
however 1
were 1
sitting 1
outside 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
running 1
lina 1
said 1
to 1
fundevogel 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
fundevogel 1
said 1
neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
then 1
said 1
lina 1
do 1
you 1
become 1
a 1
rosetree 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
rose 1
upon 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
nothing 1
was 1
there 1
but 1
a 1
rosetree 1
and 1
one 1
rose 1
on 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
nowhere 1
then 1
said 1
they 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
here 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
cook 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
rosebush 1
with 1
one 1
rose 1
on 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
scolded 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
simpletons 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
cut 1
the 1
rosebush 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
have 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
they 1
had 1
therefore 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
look 1
for 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
the 1
children 1
however 1
saw 1
them 1
coming 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
then 1
lina 1
said 1
fundevogel 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
fundevogel 1
said 1
neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
said 1
lina 1
then 1
do 1
you 1
become 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
ill 1
be 1
the 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
came 1
nothing 1
was 1
there 1
but 1
a 1
church 1
with 1
a 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
they 1
said 1
therefore 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
what 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
here 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
home 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
home 1
the 1
cook 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
no 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
scolded 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
fools 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
pull 1
the 1
church 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
bring 1
the 1
chandelier 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
herself 1
got 1
on 1
her 1
legs 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
the 1
children 1
however 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
that 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
were 1
coming 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
waddling 1
after 1
them 1
then 1
said 1
lina 1
fundevogel 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
then 1
said 1
fundevogel 1
neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
said 1
lina 1
be 1
a 1
fishpond 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
duck 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
cook 1
however 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
pond 1
she 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
drink 1
it 1
up 1
but 1
the 1
duck 1
swam 1
quickly 1
to 1
her 1
seized 1
her 1
head 1
in 1
its 1
beak 1
and 1
drew 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
there 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
had 1
to 1
drown 1
then 1
the 1
children 1
went 1
home 1
together 1
and 1
were 1
heartily 1
delighted 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
died 1
they 1
are 1
living 1
still 1
the 1
valiant 1
little 1
tailor 1
one 1
summers 1
morning 1
a 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
sitting 1
on 1
his 1
table 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
and 1
sewed 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
then 1
came 1
a 1
peasant 1
woman 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
crying 1
good 1
jams 1
cheap 1
good 1
jams 1
cheap 1
this 1
rang 1
pleasantly 1
in 1
the 1
tailors 1
ears 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
delicate 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
called 1
come 1
up 1
here 1
dear 1
woman 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
your 1
goods 1
the 1
woman 1
came 1
up 1
the 1
three 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
tailor 1
with 1
her 1
heavy 1
basket 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
her 1
unpack 1
all 1
the 1
pots 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
inspected 1
each 1
one 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
put 1
his 1
nose 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
said 1
the 1
jam 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
so 1
weigh 1
me 1
out 1
four 1
ounces 1
dear 1
woman 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
pound 1
that 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
consequence 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
hoped 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
sale 1
gave 1
him 1
