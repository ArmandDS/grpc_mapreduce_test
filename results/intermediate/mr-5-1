fingers 1
spread 1
shouting 1
help 1
for 1
pitys 1
sake 1
help 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
held 1
her 1
head 1
suggested 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
gregor 1
better 1
but 1
the 1
unthinking 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
hurrying 1
backwards 1
showed 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
she 1
had 1
forgotten 1
that 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
behind 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
breakfast 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
table 1
she 1
sat 1
quickly 1
down 1
on 1
it 1
without 1
knowing 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
without 1
even 1
seeming 1
to 1
notice 1
that 1
the 1
coffee 1
pot 1
had 1
been 1
knocked 1
over 1
and 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
coffee 1
was 1
pouring 1
down 1
onto 1
the 1
carpet 1
mother 1
mother 1
said 1
gregor 1
gently 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
her 1
he 1
had 1
completely 1
forgotten 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
himself 1
snapping 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
his 1
jaws 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
flow 1
of 1
coffee 1
that 1
set 1
his 1
mother 1
screaming 1
anew 1
she 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
rushed 1
towards 1
her 1
gregor 1
though 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
spare 1
for 1
his 1
parents 1
now 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
already 1
reached 1
the 1
stairs 1
with 1
his 1
chin 1
on 1
the 1
banister 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
gregor 1
made 1
a 1
run 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
of 1
reaching 1
him 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
must 1
have 1
expected 1
something 1
as 1
he 1
leapt 1
down 1
several 1
steps 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
disappeared 1
his 1
shouts 1
resounding 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
staircase 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
seemed 1
unfortunately 1
to 1
put 1
gregors 1
father 1
into 1
a 1
panic 1
as 1
well 1
until 1
then 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
relatively 1
self 1
controlled 1
but 1
now 1
instead 1
of 1
running 1
after 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
himself 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
impeding 1
gregor 1
as 1
he 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
gregors 1
father 1
seized 1
the 1
chief 1
clerks 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
behind 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
overcoat 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
large 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
and 1
used 1
them 1
to 1
drive 1
gregor 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
stamping 1
his 1
foot 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
gregors 1
appeals 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
help 1
his 1
appeals 1
were 1
simply 1
not 1
understood 1
however 1
much 1
he 1
humbly 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
his 1
father 1
merely 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
all 1
the 1
harder 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
despite 1
the 1
chilly 1
weather 1
gregors 1
mother 1
had 1
pulled 1
open 1
a 1
window 1
leant 1
far 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
pressed 1
her 1
hands 1
to 1
her 1
face 1
a 1
strong 1
draught 1
of 1
air 1
flew 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
towards 1
the 1
stairway 1
the 1
curtains 1
flew 1
up 1
the 1
newspapers 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
fluttered 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
blown 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
nothing 1
would 1
stop 1
gregors 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
drove 1
him 1
back 1
making 1
hissing 1
noises 1
at 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
gregor 1
had 1
never 1
had 1
any 1
practice 1
in 1
moving 1
backwards 1
and 1
was 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
very 1
slowly 1
if 1
gregor 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
allowed 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
straight 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
become 1
impatient 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
a 1
lethal 1
blow 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
fathers 1
hand 1
any 1
moment 1
eventually 1
though 1
gregor 1
realised 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
to 1
his 1
disgust 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
incapable 1
of 1
going 1
backwards 1
in 1
a 1
straight 1
line 1
so 1
he 1
began 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
with 1
frequent 1
anxious 1
glances 1
at 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
turn 1
himself 1
round 1
it 1
went 1
very 1
slowly 1
but 1
perhaps 1
his 1
father 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
good 1
intentions 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
nothing 1
to 1
hinder 1
him 1
in 1
fact 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
used 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
his 1
stick 1
to 1
give 1
directions 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
as 1
to 1
which 1
way 1
to 1
turn 1
if 1
only 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
stop 1
that 1
unbearable 1
hissing 1
it 1
was 1
making 1
gregor 1
quite 1
confused 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
nearly 1
finished 1
turning 1
round 1
still 1
listening 1
to 1
that 1
hissing 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
and 1
turned 1
himself 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
he 1
was 1
pleased 1
when 1
he 1
finally 1
had 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
doorway 1
but 1
then 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
narrow 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
too 1
broad 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
it 1
without 1
further 1
difficulty 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
mood 1
it 1
obviously 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
the 1
double 1
doors 1
so 1
that 1
gregor 1
would 1
have 1
enough 1
space 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
he 1
was 1
merely 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
gregor 1
should 1
be 1
got 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
nor 1
would 1
he 1
ever 1
have 1
allowed 1
gregor 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
himself 1
upright 1
as 1
preparation 1
for 1
getting 1
through 1
the 1
doorway 1
what 1
he 1
did 1
making 1
more 1
noise 1
than 1
ever 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
gregor 1
forwards 1
all 1
the 1
harder 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
sounded 1
to 1
gregor 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
father 1
behind 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
pleasant 1
experience 1
and 1
gregor 1
pushed 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
doorway 1
without 1
regard 1
for 1
what 1
might 1
happen 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
lifted 1
itself 1
he 1
lay 1
at 1
an 1
angle 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
one 1
flank 1
scraped 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
door 1
and 1
was 1
painfully 1
injured 1
leaving 1
vile 1
brown 1
flecks 1
on 1
it 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
along 1
one 1
side 1
hung 1
quivering 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
while 1
those 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
were 1
pressed 1
painfully 1
against 1
the 1
ground 1
then 1
his 1
father 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
hefty 1
shove 1
from 1
behind 1
which 1
released 1
him 1
from 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
sent 1
him 1
flying 1
and 1
heavily 1
bleeding 1
deep 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
slammed 1
shut 1
with 1
the 1
stick 1
then 1
finally 1
all 1
was 1
quiet 1
ii 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
dark 1
that 1
evening 1
that 1
gregor 1
awoke 1
from 1
his 1
deep 1
and 1
comalike 1
sleep 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
woken 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
anyway 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
hadnt 1
been 1
disturbed 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
enough 1
sleep 1
and 1
felt 1
fully 1
rested 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
some 1
hurried 1
steps 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
leading 1
into 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
being 1
carefully 1
shut 1
had 1
woken 1
him 1
the 1
light 1
from 1
the 1
electric 1
street 1
lamps 1
shone 1
palely 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
onto 1
the 1
ceiling 1
and 1
tops 1
of 1
the 1
furniture 1
but 1
down 1
below 1
where 1
gregor 1
was 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
he 1
pushed 1
himself 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
feeling 1
his 1
way 1
clumsily 1
with 1
his 1
antennae 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
beginning 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
value 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
happening 1
there 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
his 1
left 1
side 1
seemed 1
like 1
one 1
painfully 1
stretched 1
scar 1
and 1
he 1
limped 1
badly 1
on 1
his 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
legs 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
legs 1
had 1
been 1
badly 1
injured 1
in 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
that 1
morning 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
a 1
miracle 1
that 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
dragged 1
along 1
lifelessly 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
he 1
realised 1
what 1
it 1
actually 1
was 1
that 1
had 1
drawn 1
him 1
over 1
to 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dish 1
filled 1
with 1
sweetened 1
milk 1
with 1
little 1
pieces 1
of 1
white 1
bread 1
floating 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
he 1
almost 1
laughed 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
even 1
hungrier 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
that 1
morning 1
and 1
immediately 1
dipped 1
his 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
milk 1
nearly 1
covering 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
drew 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
disappointment 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
tender 1
left 1
side 1
make 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
food 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
eat 1
if 1
his 1
whole 1
body 1
worked 1
together 1
as 1
a 1
snuffling 1
whole 1
but 1
the 1
milk 1
did 1
not 1
taste 1
at 1
all 1
nice 1
milk 1
like 1
this 1
was 1
normally 1
his 1
favourite 1
drink 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
certainly 1
left 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
him 1
because 1
of 1
that 1
but 1
he 1
turned 1
almost 1
against 1
his 1
own 1
will 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
crawled 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
through 1
the 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
gregor 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
gas 1
had 1
been 1
lit 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
his 1
father 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
would 1
normally 1
be 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
evening 1
paper 1
reading 1
it 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
to 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sometimes 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
gregors 1
sister 1
would 1
often 1
write 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
this 1
reading 1
but 1
maybe 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
habit 1
in 1
recent 1
times 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
all 1
around 1
too 1
even 1
though 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
somebody 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
what 1
a 1
quiet 1
life 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
family 1
lead 1
said 1
gregor 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
gazing 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
felt 1
a 1
great 1
pride 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
provide 1
a 1
life 1
like 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
nice 1
home 1
for 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
parents 1
but 1
what 1
now 1
if 1
all 1
this 1
peace 1
and 1
wealth 1
and 1
comfort 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
horrible 1
and 1
frightening 1
end 1
that 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
gregor 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
too 1
much 1
so 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
crawling 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
once 1
during 1
that 1
long 1
evening 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
opened 1
very 1
slightly 1
and 1
hurriedly 1
closed 1
again 1
later 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
someone 1
needed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
thought 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
gregor 1
went 1
and 1
waited 1
immediately 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
resolved 1
either 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
timorous 1
visitor 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
no 1
more 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
gregor 1
waited 1
in 1
vain 1
the 1
previous 1
morning 1
while 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
everyone 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
there 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
now 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
opened 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
doors 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
clearly 1
been 1
unlocked 1
some 1
time 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
noone 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
keys 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
sides 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
late 1
at 1
night 1
that 1
the 1
gaslight 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
was 1
put 1
out 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
parents 1
and 1
sister 1
had 1
stayed 1
awake 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
as 1
they 1
all 1
could 1
be 1
distinctly 1
heard 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
together 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
that 1
noone 1
would 1
come 1
into 1
gregors 1
room 1
any 1
more 1
until 1
morning 1
that 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
undisturbed 1
about 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
rearrange 1
his 1
life 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
the 1
tall 1
empty 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
remain 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
uneasy 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
flat 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
living 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
five 1
years 1
hardly 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
other 1
than 1
a 1
slight 1
feeling 1
of 1
shame 1
he 1
hurried 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
it 1
pressed 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
able 1
to 1
lift 1
his 1
head 1
but 1
he 1
nonetheless 1
felt 1
immediately 1
at 1
ease 1
and 1
his 1
only 1
regret 1
was 1
that 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
too 1
broad 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
all 1
underneath 1
he 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
there 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
passed 1
in 1
a 1
light 1
sleep 1
although 1
he 1
frequently 1
woke 1
from 1
it 1
in 1
alarm 1
because 1
of 1
his 1
hunger 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
worries 1
and 1
vague 1
hopes 1
which 1
however 1
always 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
conclusion 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
he 1
must 1
remain 1
calm 1
he 1
must 1
show 1
patience 1
and 1
the 1
greatest 1
consideration 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
family 1
could 1
bear 1
the 1
unpleasantness 1
that 1
he 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
condition 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
impose 1
on 1
them 1
gregor 1
soon 1
had 1
the 1
opportunity 1
to 1
test 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
his 1
decisions 1
as 1
early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
almost 1
before 1
the 1
night 1
had 1
ended 1
his 1
sister 1
nearly 1
fully 1
dressed 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
anxiously 1
in 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
straight 1
away 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
did 1
notice 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
somewhere 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
he 1
couldnt 1
have 1
flown 1
away 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
shocked 1
that 1
she 1
lost 1
control 1
of 1
herself 1
and 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
again 1
from 1
outside 1
but 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
regret 1
her 1
behaviour 1
as 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
again 1
straight 1
away 1
and 1
came 1
in 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
as 1
if 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
of 1
someone 1
seriously 1
ill 1
or 1
even 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
gregor 1
had 1
pushed 1
his 1
head 1
forward 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
watched 1
her 1
would 1
she 1
notice 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
milk 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
realise 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
from 1
any 1
lack 1
of 1
hunger 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
other 1
food 1
that 1
was 1
more 1
suitable 1
if 1
she 1
didnt 1
do 1
it 1
herself 1
he 1
would 1
rather 1
go 1
hungry 1
than 1
draw 1
her 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
although 1
he 1
did 1
feel 1
a 1
terrible 1
urge 1
to 1
rush 1
forward 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
throw 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
sisters 1
feet 1
and 1
beg 1
her 1
for 1
something 1
good 1
to 1
eat 1
however 1
his 1
sister 1
noticed 1
the 1
full 1
dish 1
immediately 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
milk 1
splashed 1
around 1
it 1
with 1
some 1
surprise 1
she 1
immediately 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
using 1
a 1
rag 1
not 1
her 1
bare 1
hands 1
and 1
carried 1
it 1
out 1
gregor 1
was 1
extremely 1
curious 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
bring 1
in 1
its 1
place 1
imagining 1
the 1
wildest 1
possibilities 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
could 1
have 1
guessed 1
what 1
his 1
sister 1
in 1
her 1
goodness 1
actually 1
did 1
bring 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
test 1
his 1
taste 1
she 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
whole 1
selection 1
of 1
things 1
all 1
spread 1
out 1
on 1
an 1
old 1
newspaper 1
there 1
were 1
old 1
halfrotten 1
vegetables 1
bones 1
from 1
the 1
evening 1
meal 1
covered 1
in 1
white 1
sauce 1
that 1
had 1
gone 1
hard 1
a 1
few 1
raisins 1
and 1
almonds 1
some 1
cheese 1
that 1
gregor 1
had 1
declared 1
inedible 1
two 1
days 1
before 1
a 1
dry 1
roll 1
and 1
some 1
bread 1
spread 1
with 1
butter 1
and 1
salt 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
poured 1
some 1
water 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
which 1
had 1
probably 1
been 1
permanently 1
set 1
aside 1
for 1
gregors 1
use 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
beside 1
them 1
then 1
out 1
of 1
consideration 1
for 1
gregors 1
feelings 1
as 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
eat 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
hurried 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
even 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
so 1
that 1
gregor 1
would 1
know 1
he 1
could 1
make 1
things 1
as 1
comfortable 1
for 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
liked 1
gregors 1
little 1
legs 1
whirred 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
eat 1
whats 1
more 1
his 1
injuries 1
must 1
already 1
have 1
completely 1
healed 1
as 1
he 1
found 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
moving 1
this 1
amazed 1
him 1
as 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
month 1
earlier 1
he 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
finger 1
slightly 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
how 1
his 1
finger 1
had 1
still 1
hurt 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
yesterday 1
am 1
i 1
less 1
sensitive 1
than 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
then 1
he 1
thought 1
and 1
was 1
already 1
sucking 1
greedily 1
at 1
the 1
cheese 1
which 1
had 1
immediately 1
almost 1
compellingly 1
attracted 1
him 1
much 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
foods 1
on 1
the 1
newspaper 1
quickly 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
his 1
eyes 1
watering 1
with 1
pleasure 1
he 1
consumed 1
the 1
cheese 1
the 1
vegetables 1
and 1
the 1
sauce 1
the 1
fresh 1
foods 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
didnt 1
like 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
even 1
dragged 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
eat 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
away 1
from 1
them 1
because 1
he 1
couldnt 1
stand 1
the 1
smell 1
long 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
eating 1
and 1
lay 1
lethargic 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
his 1
sister 1
slowly 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
withdraw 1
he 1
was 1
immediately 1
startled 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
half 1
asleep 1
and 1
he 1
hurried 1
back 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
but 1
he 1
needed 1
great 1
selfcontrol 1
to 1
stay 1
there 1
even 1
for 1
the 1
short 1
time 1
that 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
eating 1
so 1
much 1
food 1
had 1
rounded 1
out 1
his 1
body 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
breathe 1
in 1
that 1
narrow 1
space 1
half 1
suffocating 1
he 1
watched 1
with 1
bulging 1
eyes 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
unselfconsciously 1
took 1
a 1
broom 1
and 1
swept 1
up 1
the 1
leftovers 1
mixing 1
them 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
food 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
touched 1
at 1
all 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
used 1
any 1
more 1
she 1
quickly 1
dropped 1
it 1
all 1
into 1
a 1
bin 1
closed 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
wooden 1
lid 1
and 1
carried 1
everything 1
out 1
she 1
had 1
hardly 1
turned 1
her 1
back 1
before 1
gregor 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
stretched 1
himself 1
this 1
was 1
how 1
gregor 1
received 1
his 1
food 1
each 1
day 1
now 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
while 1
his 1
parents 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
were 1
still 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
after 1
everyone 1
had 1
eaten 1
their 1
meal 1
at 1
midday 1
as 1
his 1
parents 1
would 1
sleep 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
then 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
gregors 1
sister 1
would 1
send 1
the 1
maid 1
away 1
on 1
some 1
errand 1
gregors 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
certainly 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
starve 1
either 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
they 1
could 1
stand 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
more 1
experience 1
of 1
his 1
feeding 1
than 1
being 1
told 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
perhaps 1
his 1
sister 1
wanted 1
to 1
spare 1
them 1
what 1
distress 1
she 1
could 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
indeed 1
suffering 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
gregor 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
locksmith 1
that 1
first 1
morning 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
as 1
nobody 1
could 1
understand 1
him 1
nobody 1
not 1
even 1
his 1
sister 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
understand 1
them 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
content 1
to 1
hear 1
his 1
sisters 1
sighs 1
and 1
appeals 1
to 1
the 1
saints 1
as 1
she 1
moved 1
about 1
his 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
later 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
used 1
to 1
everything 1
there 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
no 1
question 1
of 1
her 1
ever 1
becoming 1
fully 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
situation 1
that 1
gregor 1
would 1
sometimes 1
catch 1
a 1
friendly 1
comment 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
comment 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
construed 1
as 1
friendly 1
hes 1
enjoyed 1
his 1
dinner 1
today 1
she 1
might 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
diligently 1
cleared 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
food 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
left 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
which 1
slowly 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
frequent 1
she 1
would 1
often 1
say 1
sadly 1
now 1
everythings 1
just 1
been 1
left 1
there 1
again 1
although 1
gregor 1
wasnt 1
able 1
to 1
hear 1
any 1
news 1
directly 1
he 1
did 1
listen 1
to 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
rooms 1
and 1
whenever 1
he 1
heard 1
anyone 1
speaking 1
he 1
would 1
scurry 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
appropriate 1
door 1
and 1
press 1
his 1
whole 1
body 1
against 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
seldom 1
any 1
conversation 1
especially 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
about 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
even 1
if 1
only 1
in 1
secret 1
for 1
two 1
whole 1
days 1
all 1
the 1
talk 1
at 1
every 1
mealtime 1
was 1
about 1
what 1
they 1
should 1
do 1
now 1
but 1
even 1
between 1
meals 1
they 1
spoke 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
subject 1
as 1
there 1
were 1
always 1
at 1
least 1
two 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
at 1
home 1
nobody 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
home 1
by 1
themselves 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
flat 1
entirely 1
empty 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
day 1
the 1
maid 1
had 1
fallen 1
to 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
begged 1
gregors 1
mother 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
without 1
delay 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
clear 1
how 1
much 1
she 1
knew 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
she 1
left 1
within 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
tearfully 1
thanking 1
gregors 1
mother 1
for 1
her 1
dismissal 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
her 1
an 1
enormous 1
service 1
she 1
even 1
swore 1
emphatically 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anyone 1
the 1
slightest 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
even 1
though 1
noone 1
had 1
asked 1
that 1
of 1
her 1
now 1
gregors 1
sister 1
also 1
had 1
to 1
help 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
cooking 1
although 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
bother 1
as 1
noone 1
ate 1
very 1
much 1
gregor 1
often 1
heard 1
how 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
unsuccessfully 1
urge 1
another 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
receive 1
no 1
more 1
answer 1
than 1
no 1
thanks 1
ive 1
had 1
enough 1
or 1
something 1
similar 1
noone 1
drank 1
very 1
much 1
either 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
sometimes 1
ask 1
his 1
father 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
a 1
beer 1
hoping 1
for 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
herself 1
when 1
his 1
father 1
then 1
said 1
nothing 1
she 1
would 1
add 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
feel 1
selfish 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
send 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
close 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
a 1
big 1
loud 1
no 1
and 1
no 1
more 1
would 1
be 1
said 1
even 1
before 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
explained 1
to 1
gregors 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
what 1
their 1
finances 1
and 1
prospects 1
were 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
took 1
some 1
receipt 1
or 1
document 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
cash 1
box 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
from 1
his 1
business 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
collapsed 1
five 1
years 1
earlier 1
gregor 1
heard 1
how 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
complicated 1
lock 1
and 1
then 1
closed 1
it 1
again 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
item 1
he 1
wanted 1
what 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
father 1
say 1
was 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
good 1
news 1
that 1
gregor 1
heard 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
first 1
been 1
incarcerated 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
that 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
remained 1
from 1
his 1
fathers 1
business 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
told 1
him 1
anything 1
different 1
and 1
gregor 1
had 1
never 1
asked 1
him 1
about 1
it 1
anyway 1
their 1
business 1
misfortune 1
had 1
reduced 1
the 1
family 1
to 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
total 1
despair 1
and 1
gregors 1
only 1
concern 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
arrange 1
things 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
all 1
forget 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
so 1
then 1
he 1
started 1
working 1
especially 1
hard 1
with 1
a 1
fiery 1
vigour 1
that 1
raised 1
him 1
from 1
a 1
junior 1
salesman 1
to 1
a 1
travelling 1
representative 1
almost 1
overnight 1
bringing 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
earn 1
money 1
in 1
quite 1
different 1
ways 1
gregor 1
converted 1
his 1
success 1
at 1
work 1
straight 1
into 1
cash 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
at 1
home 1
for 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
his 1
astonished 1
and 1
delighted 1
family 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
good 1
times 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
come 1
again 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
splendour 1
even 1
though 1
gregor 1
had 1
later 1
earned 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
costs 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
family 1
and 1
did 1
bear 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
even 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
both 1
gregor 1
and 1
the 1
family 1
they 1
took 1
the 1
money 1
with 1
gratitude 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
provide 1
it 1
although 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
much 1
warm 1
affection 1
given 1
in 1
return 1
gregor 1
only 1
remained 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
now 1
unlike 1
him 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
music 1
and 1
a 1
gifted 1
and 1
expressive 1
violinist 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
secret 1
plan 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
next 1
year 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
cause 1
great 1
expense 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
in 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
during 1
gregors 1
short 1
periods 1
in 1
town 1
conversation 1
with 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
often 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
ever 1
mentioned 1
as 1
a 1
lovely 1
dream 1
that 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
realised 1
their 1
parents 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
hear 1
this 1
innocent 1
talk 1
but 1
gregor 1
thought 1
about 1
it 1
quite 1
hard 1
and 1
decided 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
them 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
planned 1
with 1
a 1
grand 1
announcement 1
of 1
it 1
on 1
christmas 1
day 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
totally 1
pointless 1
thing 1
that 1
went 1
through 1
his 1
mind 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
pressed 1
upright 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
listening 1
there 1
were 1
times 1
when 1
he 1
simply 1
became 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
continue 1
listening 1
when 1
his 1
head 1
would 1
fall 1
wearily 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
pull 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
as 1
even 1
the 1
slightest 1
noise 1
he 1
caused 1
would 1
be 1
heard 1
next 1
door 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
all 1
go 1
silent 1
whats 1
that 1
hes 1
doing 1
now 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
say 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
clearly 1
having 1
gone 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
only 1
then 1
would 1
the 1
interrupted 1
conversation 1
slowly 1
be 1
taken 1
up 1
again 1
when 1
explaining 1
things 1
his 1
father 1
repeated 1
himself 1
several 1
times 1
partly 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
occupied 1
with 1
these 1
matters 1
himself 1
and 1
partly 1
because 1
gregors 1
mother 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
everything 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
from 1
these 1
repeated 1
explanations 1
gregor 1
learned 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
that 1
despite 1
all 1
their 1
misfortunes 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
some 1
money 1
available 1
from 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
lot 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
touched 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
and 1
some 1
interest 1
had 1
accumulated 1
besides 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
using 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
gregor 1
had 1
been 1
bringing 1
home 1
every 1
month 1
keeping 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
himself 1
so 1
that 1
that 1
too 1
had 1
been 1
accumulating 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
gregor 1
nodded 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
in 1
his 1
pleasure 1
at 1
this 1
unexpected 1
thrift 1
and 1
caution 1
he 1
could 1
actually 1
have 1
used 1
this 1
surplus 1
money 1
to 1
reduce 1
his 1
fathers 1
debt 1
to 1
his 1
boss 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
freed 1
himself 1
from 1
that 1
job 1
would 1
have 1
come 1
much 1
closer 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
better 1
the 1
way 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
done 1
things 1
this 1
money 1
however 1
was 1
certainly 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
enable 1
the 1
family 1
to 1
live 1
off 1
the 1
interest 1
it 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
maintain 1
them 1
for 1
perhaps 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
years 1
no 1
more 1
thats 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
money 1
that 1
should 1
not 1
really 1
be 1
touched 1
but 1
set 1
aside 1
for 1
emergencies 1
money 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
earned 1
his 1
father 1
was 1
healthy 1
but 1
old 1
and 1
lacking 1
in 1
self 1
confidence 1
during 1
the 1
five 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
working 1
the 1
first 1
holiday 1
in 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
full 1
of 1
strain 1
and 1
no 1
success 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
weight 1
and 1
become 1
very 1
slow 1
and 1
clumsy 1
would 1
gregors 1
elderly 1
mother 1
now 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
earn 1
money 1
she 1
suffered 1
from 1
asthma 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
strain 1
for 1
her 1
just 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
the 1
home 1
every 1
other 1
day 1
would 1
be 1
spent 1
struggling 1
for 1
breath 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
by 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
would 1
his 1
sister 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
earn 1
money 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
a 1
child 1
of 1
seventeen 1
her 1
life 1
up 1
till 1
then 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
enviable 1
consisting 1
of 1
wearing 1
nice 1
clothes 1
sleeping 1
late 1
helping 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
joining 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
modest 1
pleasures 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
playing 1
the 1
violin 1
whenever 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
need 1
to 1
earn 1
money 1
gregor 1
would 1
always 1
first 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
throw 1
himself 1
onto 1
the 1
cool 1
leather 1
sofa 1
next 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
hot 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
regret 1
he 1
would 1
often 1
lie 1
there 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
through 1
not 1
sleeping 1
a 1
wink 1
but 1
scratching 1
at 1
the 1
leather 1
for 1
hours 1
on 1
end 1
or 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
effort 1
of 1
pushing 1
a 1
chair 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
climbing 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
sill 1
and 1
propped 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
leaning 1
on 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
stare 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
great 1
sense 1
of 1
freedom 1
from 1
doing 1
this 1
but 1
doing 1
it 1
now 1
was 1
obviously 1
something 1
more 1
remembered 1
than 1
experienced 1
as 1
what 1
he 1
actually 1
saw 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
was 1
becoming 1
less 1
distinct 1
every 1
day 1
even 1
things 1
that 1
were 1
quite 1
near 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
curse 1
the 1
everpresent 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
hospital 1
across 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
that 1
he 1
lived 1
in 1
charlottenstrasse 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
street 1
despite 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
a 1
barren 1
waste 1
where 1
the 1
grey 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
grey 1
earth 1
mingled 1
inseparably 1
his 1
observant 1
sister 1
only 1
needed 1
to 1
notice 1
the 1
chair 1
twice 1
before 1
she 1
would 1
always 1
push 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
its 1
exact 1
position 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
after 1
she 1
had 1
tidied 1
up 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
even 1
left 1
the 1
inner 1
pane 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
open 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
if 1
gregor 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
thank 1
her 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
easier 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
bear 1
it 1
but 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
caused 1
him 1
pain 1
his 1
sister 1
naturally 1
tried 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
pretend 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
burdensome 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
longer 1
it 1
went 1
on 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
better 1
she 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
but 1
as 1
time 1
went 1
by 1
gregor 1
was 1
also 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
through 1
it 1
all 1
so 1
much 1
better 1
it 1
had 1
even 1
become 1
very 1
unpleasant 1
for 1
him 1
now 1
whenever 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
no 1
sooner 1
had 1
she 1
come 1
in 1
than 1
she 1
would 1
quickly 1
close 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
a 1
precaution 1
so 1
that 1
noone 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
suffer 1
the 1
view 1
into 1
gregors 1
room 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
go 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
pull 1
it 1
hurriedly 1
open 1
almost 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
suffocating 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
cold 1
she 1
would 1
stay 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
breathing 1
deeply 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
she 1
would 1
alarm 1
gregor 1
twice 1
a 1
day 1
with 1
this 1
running 1
about 1
and 1
noise 1
making 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
shivering 1
the 1
whole 1
while 1
knowing 1
full 1
well 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
spare 1
him 1
this 1
ordeal 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
windows 1
closed 1
one 1
day 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
after 1
gregors 1
transformation 1
when 1
his 1
sister 1
no 1
longer 1
had 1
any 1
particular 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
shocked 1
at 1
his 1
appearance 1
she 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
little 1
earlier 1
than 1
usual 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
still 1
staring 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
motionless 1
and 1
just 1
where 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
horrible 1
in 1
itself 1
his 1
sisters 1
not 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
no 1
surprise 1
for 1
gregor 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
immediately 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
but 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
she 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
back 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
her 1
a 1
stranger 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
threatened 1
her 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
bite 1
her 1
gregor 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
midday 1
before 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
she 1
seemed 1
much 1
more 1
uneasy 1
than 1
usual 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
realise 1
that 1
she 1
still 1
found 1
his 1
appearance 1
unbearable 1
and 1
would 1
continue 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
she 1
probably 1
even 1
had 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
urge 1
to 1
flee 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
protruded 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
even 1
this 1
sight 1
he 1
spent 1
four 1
hours 1
carrying 1
the 1
bedsheet 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
couch 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
arranged 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
completely 1
covered 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
even 1
if 1
she 1
bent 1
down 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
this 1
sheet 1
was 1
necessary 1
then 1
all 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
enough 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
pleasure 1
for 1
gregor 1
to 1
cut 1
himself 1
off 1
so 1
completely 1
she 1
left 1
the 1
sheet 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
gregor 1
even 1
thought 1
he 1
glimpsed 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
gratitude 1
one 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
carefully 1
looked 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
his 1
sister 1
liked 1
the 1
new 1
arrangement 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
fourteen 1
days 1
gregors 1
parents 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
themselves 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
would 1
often 1
hear 1
them 1
say 1
how 1
they 1
appreciated 1
all 1
the 1
new 1
work 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
doing 1
even 1
though 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
somewhat 1
useless 1
and 1
frequently 1
been 1
annoyed 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
now 1
the 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
would 1
often 1
both 1
wait 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
gregors 1
room 1
while 1
his 1
sister 1
tidied 1
up 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
again 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
exactly 1
how 1
everything 1
looked 1
what 1
gregor 1
had 1
eaten 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
behaved 1
this 1
time 1
and 1
whether 1
perhaps 1
any 1
slight 1
improvement 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
his 1
mother 1
also 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
visit 1
gregor 1
relatively 1
soon 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
sister 1
at 1
first 1
persuaded 1
her 1
against 1
it 1
gregor 1
listened 1
very 1
closely 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
approved 1
fully 1
later 1
though 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
back 1
by 1
force 1
which 1
made 1
her 1
call 1
out 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
gregor 1
he 1
is 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
son 1
cant 1
you 1
understand 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
gregor 1
would 1
think 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
maybe 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
if 1
his 1
mother 1
came 1
in 1
not 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
a 1
week 1
perhaps 1
she 1
could 1
understand 1
everything 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
for 1
all 1
her 1
courage 1
was 1
still 1
just 1
a 1
child 1
after 1
all 1
and 1
really 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
had 1
an 1
adults 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
burdensome 1
job 1
she 1
had 1
taken 1
on 1
gregors 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
soon 1
realised 1
out 1
of 1
consideration 1
for 1
his 1
parents 1
gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
avoid 1
being 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
few 1
square 1
meters 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
him 1
much 1
room 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
just 1
lie 1
quietly 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
his 1
food 1
soon 1
stopped 1
giving 1
him 1
any 1
pleasure 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
so 1
to 1
entertain 1
himself 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
crawling 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
ceiling 1
he 1
was 1
especially 1
fond 1
of 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
ceiling 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
different 1
from 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
could 1
breathe 1
more 1
freely 1
his 1
body 1
had 1
a 1
light 1
swing 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
up 1
there 1
relaxed 1
and 1
almost 1
happy 1
it 1
might 1
happen 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
surprise 1
even 1
himself 1
by 1
letting 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
and 1
landing 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
a 1
crash 1
but 1
now 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
had 1
far 1
better 1
control 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
than 1
before 1
and 1
even 1
with 1
a 1
fall 1
as 1
great 1
as 1
that 1
caused 1
himself 1
no 1
damage 1
very 1
soon 1
his 1
sister 1
noticed 1
gregors 1
new 1
way 1
of 1
entertaining 1
himself 1
he 1
had 1
after 1
all 1
left 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
adhesive 1
from 1
his 1
feet 1
as 1
he 1
crawled 1
about 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
by 1
removing 1
the 1
furniture 1
that 1
got 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
especially 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
and 1
the 1
desk 1
now 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
something 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
by 1
herself 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
help 1
from 1
her 1
father 1
the 1
sixteen 1
year 1
old 1
maid 1
had 1
carried 1
on 1
bravely 1
since 1
the 1
cook 1
had 1
left 1
but 1
she 1
certainly 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
helped 1
in 1
this 1
she 1
had 1
even 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
kitchen 1
locked 1
at 1
all 1
times 1
and 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
unless 1
it 1
was 1
especially 1
important 1
so 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
choose 1
some 1
time 1
when 1
gregors 1
father 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
and 1
fetch 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
approached 1
the 1
room 1
gregor 1
could 1
hear 1
his 1
mother 1
express 1
her 1
joy 1
but 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
she 1
went 1
silent 1
first 1
of 1
course 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
everything 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
alright 1
and 1
only 1
then 1
did 1
she 1
let 1
her 1
mother 1
enter 1
gregor 1
had 1
hurriedly 1
pulled 1
the 1
sheet 1
down 1
lower 1
over 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
put 1
more 1
folds 1
into 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
everything 1
really 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
thrown 1
down 1
by 1
chance 1
gregor 1
also 1
refrained 1
this 1
time 1
from 1
spying 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
he 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
mother 1
until 1
later 1
and 1
was 1
simply 1
glad 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
you 1
can 1
come 1
in 1
he 1
cant 1
be 1
seen 1
said 1
his 1
sister 1
obviously 1
leading 1
her 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
the 1
old 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
was 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
feeble 1
women 1
to 1
be 1
heaving 1
about 1
but 1
gregor 1
listened 1
as 1
they 1
pushed 1
it 1
from 1
its 1
place 1
his 1
sister 1
always 1
taking 1
on 1
the 1
heaviest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
ignoring 1
her 1
mothers 1
warnings 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
strain 1
herself 1
this 1
lasted 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
labouring 1
at 1
it 1
for 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
or 1
more 1
his 1
mother 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
chest 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
one 1
thing 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
job 1
finished 1
before 1
gregors 1
father 1
got 1
home 1
and 1
leaving 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
even 1
more 1
and 1
for 1
another 1
thing 1
it 1
wasnt 1
even 1
sure 1
that 1
taking 1
the 1
furniture 1
away 1
would 1
really 1
be 1
any 1
help 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
thought 1
just 1
the 1
opposite 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
bare 1
walls 1
saddened 1
her 1
right 1
to 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
why 1
wouldnt 1
gregor 1
feel 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
about 1
it 1
hed 1
been 1
used 1
to 1
this 1
furniture 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
feel 1
abandoned 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
room 1
like 1
that 1
then 1
quietly 1
almost 1
whispering 1
as 1
if 1
wanting 1
gregor 1
whose 1
whereabouts 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
to 1
hear 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
tone 1
of 1
her 1
voice 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
her 1
words 1
she 1
added 1
and 1
by 1
taking 1
the 1
furniture 1
away 1
wont 1
it 1
seem 1
like 1
were 1
showing 1
that 1
weve 1
given 1
up 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
improvement 1
and 1
were 1
abandoning 1
him 1
to 1
cope 1
for 1
himself 1
i 1
think 1
itd 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
exactly 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
before 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
gregor 1
comes 1
back 1
to 1
us 1
again 1
hell 1
find 1
everything 1
unchanged 1
and 1
hell 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
between 1
all 1
the 1
easier 1
hearing 1
these 1
words 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
made 1
gregor 1
realise 1
that 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
any 1
direct 1
human 1
communication 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
monotonous 1
life 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
family 1
during 1
these 1
two 1
months 1
must 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
confused 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
explaining 1
to 1
himself 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
seriously 1
wanted 1
his 1
room 1
emptied 1
out 1
had 1
he 1
really 1
wanted 1
to 1
transform 1
his 1
room 1
into 1
a 1
cave 1
a 1
warm 1
room 1
fitted 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
nice 1
furniture 1
he 1
had 1
inherited 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
let 1
him 1
crawl 1
around 1
unimpeded 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
also 1
have 1
let 1
him 1
quickly 1
forget 1
his 1
past 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
still 1
been 1
human 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
very 1
close 1
to 1
forgetting 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
unheard 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
had 1
shaken 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
nothing 1
should 1
be 1
removed 1
everything 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
without 1
the 1
good 1
influence 1
the 1
furniture 1
had 1
on 1
his 1
condition 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
furniture 1
made 1
it 1
difficult 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
mindlessly 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
loss 1
but 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
his 1
sister 1
unfortunately 1
did 1
not 1
agree 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
not 1
without 1
reason 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
gregors 1
spokesman 1
to 1
his 1
parents 1
about 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
concerned 1
him 1
this 1
meant 1
that 1
his 1
mothers 1
advice 1
now 1
was 1
sufficient 1
reason 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
insist 1
on 1
removing 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
and 1
the 1
desk 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
allimportant 1
couch 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
childish 1
perversity 1
of 1
course 1
or 1
the 1
unexpected 1
confidence 1
she 1
had 1
recently 1
acquired 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
insist 1
she 1
had 1
indeed 1
noticed 1
that 1
gregor 1
needed 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
room 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
in 1
whereas 1
the 1
furniture 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
anyone 1
could 1
see 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
girls 1
of 1
that 1
age 1
though 1
do 1
become 1
enthusiastic 1
about 1
things 1
and 1
feel 1
they 1
must 1
get 1
their 1
way 1
whenever 1
they 1
can 1
perhaps 1
this 1
was 1
what 1
tempted 1
grete 1
to 1
make 1
gregors 1
situation 1
seem 1
even 1
more 1
shocking 1
than 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
even 1
more 1
for 1
him 1
grete 1
would 1
probably 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
dare 1
enter 1
a 1
room 1
dominated 1
by 1
gregor 1
crawling 1
about 1
the 1
bare 1
walls 1
by 1
himself 1
so 1
she 1
refused 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
mother 1
dissuade 1
her 1
gregors 1
mother 1
already 1
looked 1
uneasy 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
she 1
soon 1
stopped 1
speaking 1
and 1
helped 1
gregors 1
sister 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
out 1
with 1
what 1
strength 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
gregor 1
could 1
do 1
without 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
but 1
the 1
writing 1
desk 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
hardly 1
had 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
pushed 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
groaning 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
than 1
gregor 1
poked 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
careful 1
and 1
considerate 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
came 1
back 1
first 1
while 1
grete 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
had 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
the 1
chest 1
pushing 1
and 1
pulling 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
by 1
herself 1
without 1
of 1
course 1
moving 1
it 1
an 1
inch 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
gregor 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
made 1
her 1
ill 1
so 1
gregor 1
hurried 1
backwards 1
to 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
couch 1
in 1
his 1
startlement 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
able 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
sheet 1
at 1
its 1
front 1
from 1
moving 1
a 1
little 1
it 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
attract 1
his 1
mothers 1
attention 1
she 1
stood 1
very 1
still 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
back 1
out 1
to 1
grete 1
gregor 1
kept 1
trying 1
to 1
assure 1
himself 1
that 1
nothing 1
unusual 1
was 1
happening 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
pieces 1
of 1
furniture 1
being 1
moved 1
after 1
all 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
women 1
going 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
their 1
little 1
calls 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
scraping 1
of 1
the 1
furniture 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
being 1
assailed 1
from 1
all 1
sides 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
legs 1
pulled 1
in 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
pressed 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
admit 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stand 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
much 1
longer 1
they 1
were 1
emptying 1
his 1
room 1
out 1
taking 1
away 1
everything 1
that 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
already 1
taken 1
out 1
the 1
chest 1
containing 1
his 1
fretsaw 1
and 1
other 1
tools 1
now 1
they 1
threatened 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
writing 1
desk 1
with 1
its 1
place 1
clearly 1
worn 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
the 1
desk 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
his 1
homework 1
as 1
a 1
business 1
trainee 1
at 1
high 1
school 1
even 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
infant 1
schoolhe 1
really 1
could 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
the 1
two 1
womens 1
intentions 1
were 1
good 1
he 1
had 1
nearly 1
forgotten 1
they 1
were 1
there 1
anyway 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
while 1
they 1
worked 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
hear 1
their 1
feet 1
as 1
they 1
stepped 1
heavily 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
so 1
while 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
desk 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
catching 1
their 1
breath 1
he 1
sallied 1
out 1
changed 1
direction 1
four 1
times 1
