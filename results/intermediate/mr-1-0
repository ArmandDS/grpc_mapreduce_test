not 1
from 1
an 1

is 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
characteristics 1
of 1
three 1
boys 1
whom 1
i 1
knew 1
and 1
therefore 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
composite 1
order 1
of 1
architecture 1
the 1
odd 1
superstitions 1
touched 1
upon 1
were 1
all 1
prevalent 1
among 1
children 1

slaves 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
at 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
this 1
storythat 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
thirty 1
or 1
forty 1
years 1
ago 1
although 1
my 1
book 1
is 1
intended 1
mainly 1
for 1
the 1
entertainment 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
shunned 1
by 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
for 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
plan 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
pleasantly 1
remind 1
adults 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
once 1
were 1
themselves 1
and 1
of 1
how 1
they 1
felt 1
and 1
thought 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
what 1
queer 1
enterprises 1
they 1
sometimes 1

the 1
old 1
lady 1
pulled 1
her 1
spectacles 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
over 1
them 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
then 1
she 1
put 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
under 1
them 1
she 1
seldom 1
or 1
never 1
looked 1
_through_ 1
them 1
for 1
so 1
small 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
boy 1
they 1
were 1
her 1
state 1
pair 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
were 1
built 1
for 1
style 1
not 1
serviceshe 1
could 1
have 1
seen 1
through 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
stovelids 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
she 1
looked 1
perplexed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
not 1
fiercely 1
but 1
still 1
loud 1
enough 1
for 1
the 1
furniture 1
to 1
hear 1
well 1
i 1
lay 1
if 1
i 1
get 1

she 1
did 1
not 1
finish 1
for 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
was 1
bending 1
down 1
and 1
punching 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
needed 1
breath 1
to 1
punctuate 1
the 1
punches 1
with 1
she 1
resurrected 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
i 1
never 1
did 1
see 1
the 1
beat 1
of 1
that 1
boy 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
tomato 1
vines 1
and 1
jimpson 1
weeds 1
that 1
constituted 1
the 1
garden 1
no 1
tom 1
so 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
her 1
voice 1
at 1
an 1
angle 1
calculated 1
for 1
distance 1
and 1
shouted 1
youu 1
tom 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
noise 1
behind 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
turned 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
seize 1
a 1
small 1
boy 1
by 1
the 1
slack 1
of 1
his 1
roundabout 1
and 1
arrest 1
his 1
flight 1
there 1
i 1
might 1
a 1
thought 1
of 1

closet 1

round 1
and 1
snatched 1

the 1
lad 1
fled 1
on 1
the 1
instant 1

and 1
disappeared 1
over 1

through 1
with 1
his 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
picking 1
up 1
chips 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
boy 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
adventurous 1
troublesome 1
ways 1
while 1
tom 1
was 1
eating 1
his 1
supper 1
and 1
stealing 1
sugar 1
as 1
opportunity 1
offered 1
aunt 1
polly 1
asked 1
him 1
questions 1
that 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
guile 1
and 1
very 1
deepfor 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
trap 1
him 1
into 1
damaging 1
revealments 1
like 1
many 1
other 1
simplehearted 1
souls 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
pet 1
vanity 1
to 1
believe 1
she 1
was 1
endowed 1
with 1
a 1
talent 1
for 1
dark 1
and 1
mysterious 1
diplomacy 1
and 1
she 1
loved 1
to 1
contemplate 1
her 1
most 1
transparent 1
devices 1
as 1
marvels 1
of 1
low 1
cunning 1
said 1
she 1
tom 1
it 1
was 1
middling 1
warm 1
in 1
school 1
warnt 1

yesm 1
didnt 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
aswimming 1
tom 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
scare 1
shot 1
through 1
toma 1
touch 1
of 1
uncomfortable 1
suspicion 1
he 1
searched 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
face 1
but 1
it 1
told 1
him 1
nothing 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
nomwell 1
not 1
very 1
much 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
reached 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
felt 1
toms 1
shirt 1
and 1
said 1
but 1
you 1
aint 1
too 1
warm 1
now 1
though 1
and 1
it 1
flattered 1
her 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
shirt 1
was 1
dry 1
without 1
anybody 1
knowing 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
her 1
mind 1
but 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
her 1
tom 1
knew 1
where 1
the 1
wind 1
lay 1
now 1
so 1
he 1
forestalled 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
move 1
some 1
of 1
us 1
pumped 1
on 1
our 1
headsmines 1
damp 1
yet 1
see 1
aunt 1
polly 1
was 1
vexed 1
to 1
think 1
she 1
had 1
overlooked 1
that 1
bit 1
of 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
and 1
missed 1
a 1
trick 1
then 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
new 1
inspiration 1
tom 1
you 1
didnt 1
have 1
to 1
undo 1
your 1
shirt 1
collar 1
where 1
i 1
sewed 1
it 1
to 1
pump 1
on 1
your 1
head 1
did 1
you 1
unbutton 1
your 1
jacket 1
the 1
trouble 1
vanished 1
out 1
of 1
toms 1
face 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
jacket 1
his 1
shirt 1

was 1
securely 1
sewed 1

and 1

aswimming 1
but 1
i 1
forgive 1

tom 1
i 1
reckon 1

a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
singed 1
cat 1
as 1
the 1
saying 1
isbettern 1
you 1
look 1
_this_ 1
time 1
she 1
was 1
half 1
sorry 1
her 1
sagacity 1
had 1
miscarried 1
and 1
half 1
glad 1
that 1
tom 1
had 1
stumbled 1
into 1
obedient 1
conduct 1
for 1
once 1
but 1
sidney 1
said 1
well 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
think 1
you 1
sewed 1
his 1
collar 1
with 1
white 1
thread 1
but 1
its 1
black 1
why 1
i 1
did 1
sew 1
it 1
with 1
white 1
tom 1
but 1
tom 1
did 1
not 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
said 1
siddy 1
ill 1
lick 1
you 1
for 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
safe 1
place 1
tom 1
examined 1
two 1
large 1
needles 1
which 1
were 1
thrust 1
into 1
the 1
lapels 1
of 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
had 1
thread 1
bound 1
about 1
themone 1
needle 1
carried 1
white 1
thread 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
black 1
he 1
said 1

if 1
it 1
hadnt 1
been 1
for 1
sid 1
confound 1
it 1
sometimes 1
she 1
sews 1
it 1
with 1
white 1
and 1
sometimes 1
she 1
sews 1
it 1
with 1
black 1
i 1

or 1
totheri 1

keep 1
the 1
run 1
of 1
em 1
but 1
i 1
bet 1
you 1
ill 1
lam 1
sid 1
for 1
that 1
ill 1
learn 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
model 1
boy 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
model 1
boy 1
very 1
well 1
thoughand 1
loathed 1
him 1
within 1
two 1
minutes 1
or 1
even 1
less 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
not 1
because 1
his 1
troubles 1
were 1
one 1
whit 1
less 1
heavy 1
and 1
bitter 1
to 1
him 1
than 1
a 1
mans 1
are 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
because 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
powerful 1
interest 1
bore 1
them 1
down 1
and 1
drove 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
for 1
the 1
timejust 1
as 1
mens 1
misfortunes 1
are 1
forgotten 1
in 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
new 1
enterprises 1
this 1
new 1
interest 1
was 1
a 1
valued 1
novelty 1
in 1
whistling 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
acquired 1
from 1
a 1
negro 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
suffering 1
to 1
practise 1
it 1
undisturbed 1
it 1
consisted 1
in 1
a 1
peculiar 1
birdlike 1
turn 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
liquid 1
warble 1
produced 1
by 1
touching 1
the 1
tongue 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
at 1
short 1
intervals 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
musicthe 1
reader 1
probably 1
remembers 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
a 1
boy 1
diligence 1
and 1
attention 1
soon 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
knack 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
strode 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
full 1
of 1
harmony 1
and 1
his 1
soul 1
full 1
of 1
gratitude 1
he 1
felt 1
much 1
as 1
an 1
astronomer 1
feels 1
who 1
has 1
discovered 1
a 1
new 1
planetno 1
doubt 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
strong 1
deep 1
unalloyed 1
pleasure 1
is 1
concerned 1
the 1
advantage 1
was 1
with 1
the 1
boy 1
not 1
the 1
astronomer 1
the 1
summer 1
evenings 1
were 1
long 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
dark 1
yet 1
presently 1
tom 1
checked 1
his 1
whistle 1
a 1
stranger 1
was 1
before 1
hima 1
boy 1
a 1
shade 1
larger 1
than 1
himself 1
a 1
newcomer 1
of 1
any 1
age 1
or 1
either 1
sex 1
was 1
an 1
impressive 1
curiosity 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
shabby 1
village 1
of 1
st 1
petersburg 1
this 1
boy 1
was 1
well 1
dressed 1
toowell 1
dressed 1
on 1
a 1
weekday 1
this 1
was 1
simply 1
as 1
astounding 1
his 1
cap 1

a 1
dainty 1
thing 1
his 1
closebuttoned 1
blue 1
cloth 1
roundabout 1
was 1
new 1
and 1
natty 1
and 1
so 1
were 1
his 1
pantaloons 1
he 1
had 1
shoes 1
onand 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
friday 1
he 1
even 1
wore 1
a 1
necktie 1
a 1
bright 1
bit 1
of 1
ribbon 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
citified 1
air 1
about 1
him 1
that 1
ate 1
into 1
toms 1
vitals 1
the 1
more 1
tom 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
splendid 1
marvel 1
the 1
higher 1
he 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
nose 1
at 1
his 1
finery 1
and 1
the 1
shabbier 1
and 1
shabbier 1
his 1
own 1
outfit 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
grow 1
neither 1
boy 1
spoke 1
if 1
one 1
moved 1
the 1
other 1
movedbut 1
only 1
sidewise 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
they 1
kept 1
face 1
to 1
face 1

angle 1
as 1
a 1
brace 1
and 1
both 1
shoving 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
and 1
glowering 1
at 1
each 1

with 1
hate 1
but 1
neither 1

get 1
an 1
advantage 1
after 1
struggling 1
till 1
both 1
were 1
hot 1
and 1
flushed 1
each 1
relaxed 1
his 1
strain 1
with 1
watchful 1
caution 1
and 1

_your_ 1

tom 1
drew 1
a 1
line 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
with 1
his 1
big 1
toe 1
and 1
said 1

the 1
new 1
boy 1
took 1
two 1
broad 1
coppers 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
held 1
them 1
out 1
with 1
derision 1
tom 1
struck 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
both 1
boys 1
were 1
rolling 1
and 1
tumbling 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
gripped 1
together 1
like 1
cats 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
they 1
tugged 1
and 1
tore 1
at 1
each 1
others 1
hair 1
and 1
clothes 1
punched 1
and 1
scratched 1
each 1
others 1
nose 1
and 1
covered 1
themselves 1
with 1
dust 1
and 1
glory 1
presently 1
the 1
confusion 1
took 1
form 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1

astride 1
the 1
new 1
boy 1
and 1
pounding 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
fists 1
holler 1
nuff 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
boy 1
only 1
struggled 1
to 1
free 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
cryingmainly 1
from 1
rage 1
holler 1
nuffand 1
the 1
pounding 1
went 1
on 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
stranger 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
smothered 1
nuff 1
and 1
tom 1
let 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
thatll 1
learn 1
you 1
better 1
look 1
out 1
who 1
youre 1
fooling 1
with 1
next 1
time 1
the 1
new 1
boy 1
went 1
off 1
brushing 1
the 1
dust 1
from 1
his 1
clothes 1
sobbing 1
snuffling 1
and 1
occasionally 1
looking 1
back 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
threatening 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
to 1
tom 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
caught 1
him 1
out 1
to 1
which 1
tom 1
responded 1
with 1
jeers 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
in 1
high 1
feather 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
his 1
back 1
was 1
turned 1
the 1
new 1
boy 1
snatched 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
threw 1
it 1
and 1
hit 1
him 1
between 1
the 1
shoulders 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
tail 1
and 1
ran 1
like 1
an 1
antelope 1
tom 1
chased 1
the 1
traitor 1
home 1
and 1
thus 1
found 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
he 1
then 1
held 1
a 1
position 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
daring 1
the 1
enemy 1
to 1
come 1
outside 1
but 1
the 1
enemy 1
only 1
made 1
faces 1
at 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
declined 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
enemys 1
mother 1
appeared 1
and 1
called 1
tom 1
a 1
bad 1
vicious 1
vulgar 1
child 1
and 1
ordered 1
him 1
away 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
lowed 1
to 1
lay 1
for 1
that 1
boy 1
he 1
got 1
home 1
pretty 1
late 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
climbed 1
cautiously 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
uncovered 1
an 1
ambuscade 1
in 1
the 1
person 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
state 1
his 1
clothes 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
resolution 1
to 1
turn 1
his 1
saturday 1
holiday 1
into 1
captivity 1
at 1
hard 1
labor 1
became 1
adamantine 1
in 1
its 1
firmness 1
chapter 1
ii 1
saturday 1
morning 1
was 1
come 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
summer 1
world 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
fresh 1
and 1
brimming 1
with 1
life 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
song 1
in 1
every 1
heart 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
heart 1
was 1
young 1
the 1
music 1
issued 1
at 1
the 1
lips 1
there 1
was 1
cheer 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
spring 1
in 1
every 1
step 1
the 1
locusttrees 1
were 1
in 1
bloom 1
and 1
the 1
fragrance 1
of 1
the 1
blossoms 1
filled 1
the 1
air 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
beyond 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
was 1
green 1
with 1
vegetation 1
and 1
it 1
lay 1
just 1
far 1
enough 1
away 1
to 1
seem 1
a 1
delectable 1
land 1
dreamy 1
reposeful 1
and 1
inviting 1
tom 1
appeared 1
on 1
the 1
sidewalk 1
with 1
a 1
bucket 1
of 1
whitewash 1
and 1
a 1
longhandled 1
brush 1
he 1
surveyed 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
all 1
gladness 1
left 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
deep 1
melancholy 1
settled 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
spirit 1
thirty 1
yards 1
of 1
board 1
fence 1
nine 1
feet 1
high 1
life 1
to 1
him 1
seemed 1
hollow 1
and 1
existence 1
but 1
a 1
burden 1
sighing 1
he 1
dipped 1
his 1
brush 1
and 1
passed 1
it 1
along 1
the 1
topmost 1
plank 1
repeated 1
the 1
operation 1
did 1
it 1
again 1
compared 1
the 1
insignificant 1
whitewashed 1
streak 1
with 1
the 1
farreaching 1
continent 1
of 1
unwhitewashed 1
fence 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
treebox 1
discouraged 1
jim 1
came 1
skipping 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
with 1
a 1
tin 1
pail 1
and 1
singing 1
buffalo 1
gals 1
bringing 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
town 1
pump 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
hateful 1
work 1
in 1
toms 1
eyes 1
before 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
strike 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
company 1
at 1
the 1
pump 1
white 1
mulatto 1
and 1
negro 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
were 1
always 1
there 1
waiting 1
their 1
turns 1
resting 1
trading 1
playthings 1
quarrelling 1
fighting 1
skylarking 1
and 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
pump 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
yards 1
off 1
jim 1
never 1
got 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
bucket 1
of 1
water 1
under 1
an 1
hourand 1
even 1
then 1

generally 1
had 1
to 1
go 1

was 1
only 1
humanthis 1
attraction 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
put 1
down 1
his 1
pail 1
took 1
the 1
white 1
alley 1
and 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
toe 1
with 1
absorbing 1
interest 1
while 1
the 1
bandage 1
was 1
being 1
unwound 1
in 1
another 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
flying 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
his 1
pail 1
and 1
a 1
tingling 1
rear 1
tom 1
was 1
whitewashing 1
with 1
vigor 1
and 1
aunt 1
polly 1
was 1
retiring 1
from 1
the 1
field 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
triumph 1
in 1
her 1
eye 1
but 1
toms 1
energy 1
did 1
not 1
last 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
fun 1
he 1
had 1
planned 1
for 1
this 1
day 1
and 1
his 1
sorrows 1
multiplied 1
soon 1
the 1
free 1
boys 1
would 1
come 1
tripping 1
along 1
on 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
delicious 1
expeditions 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
world 1
of 1
fun 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
having 1
to 1
workthe 1
very 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
burnt 1
him 1
like 1
fire 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
worldly 1
wealth 1
and 1
examined 1
itbits 1
of 1
toys 1
marbles 1
and 1
trash 1
enough 1
to 1
buy 1
an 1
exchange 1
of 1
_work_ 1
maybe 1
but 1
not 1
half 1
enough 1
to 1
buy 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
of 1
pure 1
freedom 1
so 1
he 1
returned 1
his 1
straitened 1
means 1
to 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
buy 1
the 1
boys 1
at 1
this 1
dark 1
and 1
hopeless 1
moment 1
an 1
inspiration 1
burst 1
upon 1
him 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
great 1
magnificent 1
inspiration 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
brush 1
and 1
went 1
tranquilly 1
to 1
work 1
ben 1

very 1
boy 1

been 1
dreading 1

enough 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
his 1
anticipations 1
high 1
he 1
was 1
eating 1
an 1
apple 1
and 1
giving 1
a 1
long 1
melodious 1
whoop 1
at 1
intervals 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1

slackened 1
speed 1
took 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
street 1

far 1
over 1
to 1

rounded 1

with 1
laborious 1
pomp 1

he 1
was 1
personating 1
the 1
big 1

himself 1
to 1

was 1

he 1
gave 1
his 1

another 1
gentle 1

and 1
surveyed 1
the 1
result 1
as 1
before 1

up 1
alongside 1
of 1

a 1
chance 1
to 1

a 1
fence 1
every 1
day 1
that 1
put 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
ben 1
stopped 1
nibbling 1
his 1

up 1

in 1
his 1

he 1
would 1
have 1
bankrupted 1
every 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
tom 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
hollow 1
world 1
after 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
great 1
law 1
of 1
human 1
action 1
without 1
knowing 1
itnamely 1
that 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
boy 1
covet 1
a 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
necessary 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
difficult 1
to 1
attain 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
wise 1
philosopher 1
like 1
the 1
writer 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
he 1
would 1
now 1
have 1
comprehended 1
that 1
work 1
consists 1
of 1
whatever 1
a 1
body 1
is 1
_obliged_ 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
that 1
play 1
consists 1
of 1
whatever 1
a 1
body 1
is 1
not 1
obliged 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
this 1
would 1
help 1
him 1
to 1
understand 1
why 1
constructing 1
artificial 1
flowers 1
or 1
performing 1
on 1
a 1
treadmill 1
is 1
work 1
while 1
rolling 1
tenpins 1
or 1
climbing 1
mont 1
blanc 1
is 1
only 1
amusement 1
there 1
are 1
wealthy 1
gentlemen 1
in 1

who 1
drive 1

passengercoaches 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
miles 1
on 1
a 1
daily 1
line 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
because 1
the 1
privilege 1
costs 1
them 1
considerable 1
money 1
but 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
offered 1
wages 1
for 1
the 1
service 1
that 1
would 1
turn 1
it 1
into 1
work 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
resign 1
the 1
boy 1
mused 1
awhile 1
over 1
the 1
substantial 1
change 1
which 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
his 1
worldly 1
circumstances 1
and 1
then 1
wended 1
toward 1
headquarters 1
to 1
report 1

iii 1
tom 1
presented 1
himself 1
before 1
aunt 1
polly 1
who 1
was 1
sitting 1
by 1
an 1
open 1
window 1
in 1
a 1
pleasant 1
rearward 1
apartment 1
which 1
was 1
bedroom 1
breakfastroom 1

and 1
library 1
combined 1
the 1
balmy 1
summer 1
air 1
the 1
restful 1
quiet 1
the 1
odor 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
and 1
the 1
drowsing 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
had 1
had 1
their 1
effect 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
nodding 1
over 1
her 1
knittingfor 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
company 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
asleep 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
her 1
spectacles 1
were 1
propped 1
up 1
on 1
her 1
gray 1
head 1
for 1
safety 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
tom 1
had 1
deserted 1
long 1
ago 1
and 1
she 1
wondered 1
at 1
seeing 1
him 1
place 1
himself 1
in 1
her 1
power 1
again 1
in 1
this 1
intrepid 1
way 1
he 1
said 1
maynt 1
i 1
go 1
and 1
play 1

aunt 1
polly 1
placed 1
small 1
trust 1
in 1
such 1
evidence 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
content 1
to 1
find 1
twenty 1
per 1
cent 1
of 1
toms 1
statement 1
true 1
when 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
entire 1
fence 1
whitewashed 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
whitewashed 1
but 1
elaborately 1
coated 1
and 1
recoated 1
and 1
even 1
a 1
streak 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
her 1
astonishment 1
was 1
almost 1
unspeakable 1
she 1
said 1
well 1
i 1
never 1
theres 1
no 1
getting 1
round 1
it 1
you 1
can 1
work 1
when 1
youre 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
tom 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
diluted 1
the 1
compliment 1
by 1
adding 1
but 1
its 1
powerful 1
seldom 1
youre 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
im 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
well 1
go 1
long 1
and 1
play 1
but 1
mind 1
you 1
get 1
back 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
ill 1
tan 1
you 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
by 1
the 1
splendor 1
of 1
his 1
achievement 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
selected 1
a 1
choice 1
apple 1
and 1
delivered 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
along 1
with 1
an 1
improving 1
lecture 1
upon 1
the 1
added 1
value 1
and 1
flavor 1
a 1
treat 1
took 1
to 1
itself 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
without 1
sin 1
through 1
virtuous 1
effort 1
and 1
while 1
she 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
happy 1
scriptural 1
flourish 1
he 1
hooked 1
a 1
doughnut 1
then 1
he 1
skipped 1
out 1
and 1
saw 1
sid 1
just 1
starting 1
up 1
the 1
outside 1
stairway 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
rooms 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
clods 1
were 1
handy 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
twinkling 1
they 1
raged 1
around 1
sid 1
like 1
a 1
hailstorm 1
and 1
before 1
aunt 1
polly 1
could 1
collect 1
her 1
surprised 1
faculties 1
and 1
sally 1
to 1
the 1
rescue 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
clods 1
had 1
taken 1
personal 1
effect 1
and 1
tom 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
gone 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gate 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
general 1
thing 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
crowded 1
for 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
his 1
soul 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
settled 1
with 1
sid 1
for 1
calling 1
attention 1
to 1
his 1
black 1
thread 1
and 1
getting 1
him 1
into 1
trouble 1
tom 1
skirted 1
the 1
block 1
and 1
came 1
round 1
into 1
a 1
muddy 1
alley 1
that 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
aunts 1
cowstable 1
he 1
presently 1
got 1
safely 1
beyond 1
the 1
reach 1
of 1
capture 1
and 1
punishment 1
and 1
hastened 1
toward 1
the 1
public 1
square 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
two 1
military 1
companies 1
of 1
boys 1
had 1
met 1
for 1
conflict 1
according 1
to 1
previous 1
appointment 1

not 1
condescend 1
to 1
fight 1
in 1
personthat 1
being 1
better 1
suited 1
to 1
the 1
still 1
smaller 1
frybut 1
sat 1
together 1
on 1
an 1
eminence 1
and 1
conducted 1
the 1
field 1
operations 1
by 1
orders 1
delivered 1
through 1

toms 1
army 1
won 1
a 1
great 1
victory 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
hardfought 1
battle 1
then 1
the 1
dead 1
were 1
counted 1
prisoners 1
exchanged 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
disagreement 1
agreed 1
upon 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
necessary 1
battle 1
appointed 1
after 1
which 1
the 1
armies 1
fell 1
into 1
line 1
and 1
marched 1
away 1
and 1
tom 1
turned 1
homeward 1
alone 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
house 1
where 1
jeff 1
thatcher 1
lived 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
new 1
girl 1
in 1
the 1
gardena 1
lovely 1
little 1
blueeyed 1
creature 1
with 1
yellow 1
hair 1
plaited 1
into 1
two 1
longtails 1
white 1
summer 1
frock 1
and 1
embroidered 1
pantalettes 1
the 1
freshcrowned 1
hero 1
fell 1
without 1
firing 1
a 1
shot 1
a 1
certain 1
amy 1
lawrence 1
vanished 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
left 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
memory 1
of 1
herself 1
behind 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
he 1
loved 1
her 1
to 1
distraction 1
he 1
had 1
regarded 1
his 1
passion 1
as 1
adoration 1
and 1
behold 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
poor 1
little 1
evanescent 1
partiality 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
months 1
winning 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
confessed 1
hardly 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
happiest 1
and 1
the 1
proudest 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
only 1
seven 1
short 1
days 1
and 1
here 1
in 1
one 1
instant 1
of 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
like 1
a 1
casual 1
stranger 1
whose 1
visit 1
is 1
done 1
he 1
worshipped 1
this 1
new 1
angel 1
with 1
furtive 1
eye 1
till 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
pretended 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
she 1
was 1
present 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
show 1
off 1
in 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
absurd 1
boyish 1
ways 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
win 1
her 1
admiration 1
he 1
kept 1
up 1
this 1
grotesque 1
foolishness 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
byandby 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
some 1
dangerous 1
gymnastic 1
performances 1
he 1
glanced 1
aside 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
was 1
wending 1
her 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
house 1
tom 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
leaned 1
on 1
it 1
grieving 1
and 1
hoping 1
she 1
would 1
tarry 1
yet 1
awhile 1
longer 1
she 1
halted 1
a 1
moment 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
then 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
door 1
tom 1
heaved 1
a 1
great 1
sigh 1
as 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
but 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
right 1
away 1
for 1
she 1
tossed 1
a 1
pansy 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
a 1
moment 1
before 1
she 1
disappeared 1
the 1
boy 1
ran 1
around 1
and 1
stopped 1
within 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
then 1
shaded 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
down 1
street 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
discovered 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
that 1
direction 1
presently 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
straw 1
and 1
began 1
trying 1
to 1
balance 1
it 1
on 1
his 1
nose 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
tilted 1
far 1
back 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
moved 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
in 1
his 1
efforts 1
he 1
edged 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
toward 1
the 1
pansy 1
finally 1
his 1
bare 1
foot 1
rested 1
upon 1
it 1
his 1
pliant 1
toes 1
closed 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
hopped 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
treasure 1
and 1
disappeared 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
minuteonly 1
while 1
he 1
could 1
button 1
the 1
flower 1
inside 1
his 1
jacket 1
next 1
his 1
heartor 1
next 1
his 1
stomach 1
possibly 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
posted 1
in 1
anatomy 1
and 1
not 1
hypercritical 1
anyway 1
he 1
returned 1
now 1
and 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
fence 1
till 1
nightfall 1
showing 1
off 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
never 1
exhibited 1
herself 1
again 1
though 1
tom 1
comforted 1
himself 1
a 1
little 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
near 1
some 1
window 1
meantime 1
and 1
been 1
aware 1
of 1
his 1
attentions 1
finally 1
he 1
strode 1
home 1
reluctantly 1
with 1
his 1
poor 1
head 1
full 1
of 1
visions 1
all 1
through 1
supper 1
his 1
spirits 1
were 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
his 1
aunt 1
wondered 1
what 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
child 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
scolding 1
about 1
clodding 1
sid 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
mind 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
steal 1
sugar 1
under 1
his 1
aunts 1
very 1
nose 1
and 1
got 1
his 1
knuckles 1
rapped 1
for 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
aunt 1
you 1
dont 1
whack 1
sid 1
when 1
he 1
takes 1
it 1
well 1
sid 1
dont 1
torment 1
a 1
body 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
do 1
youd 1
be 1
always 1
into 1
that 1
sugar 1
if 1
i 1
warnt 1
watching 1
you 1
presently 1
she 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
sid 1
happy 1
in 1
his 1
immunity 1
reached 1
for 1
the 1
sugarbowla 1
sort 1
of 1
glorying 1
over 1
tom 1
which 1
was 1
wellnigh 1
unbearable 1
but 1
sids 1
fingers 1
slipped 1
and 1
the 1
bowl 1
dropped 1
and 1
broke 1
tom 1
was 1
in 1
ecstasies 1
in 1
such 1
ecstasies 1
that 1
he 1
even 1
controlled 1
his 1
tongue 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
a 1
word 1
even 1
when 1
his 1
aunt 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
would 1
sit 1
perfectly 1
still 1
till 1
she 1
asked 1
who 1
did 1
the 1
mischief 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
so 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
pet 1
model 1
catch 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
brimful 1
of 1
exultation 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
hold 1
himself 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
stood 1
above 1
the 1
wreck 1
discharging 1
lightnings 1
of 1
wrath 1
from 1
over 1
her 1
spectacles 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
now 1
its 1
coming 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
he 1
was 1
sprawling 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
the 1
potent 1
palm 1
was 1
uplifted 1
to 1
strike 1
again 1
when 1
tom 1
cried 1
out 1
hold 1
on 1
now 1
what 1
er 1
you 1
belting 1
_me_ 1
forsid 1
broke 1
it 1
aunt 1
polly 1
paused 1
perplexed 1
and 1
tom 1
looked 1
for 1
healing 1
pity 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
her 1
tongue 1
again 1
she 1
only 1
said 1
umf 1
well 1
you 1
didnt 1
get 1
a 1
lick 1
amiss 1
i 1
reckon 1
you 1
been 1
into 1
some 1
other 1
audacious 1
mischief 1
when 1
i 1
wasnt 1
around 1
like 1
enough 1
then 1
her 1
conscience 1
reproached 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
yearned 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
kind 1
and 1
loving 1
but 1
she 1
judged 1
that 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
construed 1
into 1
a 1
confession 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
and 1
discipline 1
forbade 1
that 1
so 1
she 1
kept 1
silence 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
her 1
affairs 1
with 1
a 1
troubled 1
heart 1
tom 1
sulked 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
exalted 1
his 1
woes 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
his 1
aunt 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
morosely 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
hang 1
out 1
no 1
signals 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
notice 1
of 1
none 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
a 1
yearning 1
glance 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
through 1
a 1
film 1
of 1
tears 1
but 1
he 1
refused 1
recognition 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
pictured 1
himself 1
lying 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
and 1
his 1
aunt 1
bending 1
over 1
him 1
beseeching 1
one 1
little 1
forgiving 1
word 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
turn 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
die 1
with 1
that 1
word 1
unsaid 1
ah 1
how 1
would 1
she 1
feel 1
then 1
and 1
he 1
pictured 1
himself 1
brought 1
home 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
dead 1
with 1
his 1
curls 1
all 1
wet 1
and 1
his 1
sore 1
heart 1
at 1
rest 1
how 1
she 1
would 1
throw 1
herself 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
how 1
her 1
tears 1
would 1
fall 1
like 1
rain 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
pray 1
god 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
back 1
her 1
boy 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
never 1
abuse 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
lie 1
there 1
cold 1
and 1
white 1
and 1
make 1
no 1
signa 1
poor 1
little 1
sufferer 1
whose 1
griefs 1
were 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
he 1
so 1
worked 1
upon 1
his 1
feelings 1
with 1
the 1
pathos 1
of 1
these 1
dreams 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
keep 1
swallowing 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
like 1
to 1
choke 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
swam 1
in 1
a 1
blur 1
of 1
water 1
which 1
overflowed 1
when 1
he 1
winked 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
and 1
trickled 1
from 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
nose 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
luxury 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
this 1
petting 1
of 1
his 1
sorrows 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
worldly 1
cheeriness 1
or 1
any 1
grating 1
delight 1
intrude 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
sacred 1
for 1
such 1
contact 1
and 1
so 1
presently 1
when 1
his 1
cousin 1
mary 1
danced 1
in 1
all 1
alive 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
seeing 1
home 1
again 1
after 1
an 1
agelong 1
visit 1
of 1
one 1
week 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
moved 1
in 1
clouds 1
and 1
darkness 1
out 1
at 1
one 1
door 1
as 1
she 1
brought 1
song 1
and 1
sunshine 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
wandered 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
accustomed 1
haunts 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
sought 1
desolate 1
places 1
that 1
were 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
his 1
spirit 1
a 1
log 1
raft 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
invited 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
its 1
outer 1
edge 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
dreary 1
vastness 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
wishing 1
the 1
while 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
drowned 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
unconsciously 1
without 1
undergoing 1
the 1
uncomfortable 1
routine 1
devised 1
by 1
nature 1
then 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
flower 1
he 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
rumpled 1
and 1
wilted 1
and 1
it 1
mightily 1
increased 1
his 1
dismal 1
felicity 1
he 1
wondered 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
pity 1
him 1
if 1
she 1
knew 1
would 1
she 1
cry 1
and 1
wish 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
put 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
comfort 1
him 1
or 1
would 1
she 1
turn 1
coldly 1
away 1
like 1
all 1
the 1
hollow 1
world 1
this 1
picture 1
brought 1
such 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
pleasurable 1
suffering 1
that 1
he 1
worked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
new 1
and 1
varied 1
lights 1
till 1
he 1
wore 1
it 1
threadbare 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
rose 1
up 1
sighing 1
and 1
departed 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
about 1
halfpast 1
nine 1
or 1
ten 1
oclock 1
he 1
came 1
along 1
the 1
deserted 1
street 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
adored 1
unknown 1
lived 1
he 1
paused 1
a 1
moment 1
no 1
sound 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
listening 1
ear 1
a 1
candle 1
was 1
casting 1
a 1
dull 1
glow 1
upon 1
the 1
curtain 1
of 1
a 1
secondstory 1
window 1
was 1
the 1
sacred 1
presence 1
there 1
he 1
climbed 1
the 1
fence 1
threaded 1
his 1
stealthy 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
plants 1
till 1
he 1
stood 1
under 1
that 1
window 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
it 1
long 1
and 1
with 1
emotion 1
then 1
he 1
laid 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
under 1
it 1
disposing 1
himself 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
clasped 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
holding 1
his 1
poor 1
wilted 1
flower 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
would 1
dieout 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
with 1
no 1
shelter 1
over 1
his 1
homeless 1
head 1
no 1
friendly 1
hand 1
to 1
wipe 1
the 1
deathdamps 1
from 1
his 1
brow 1
no 1
loving 1
face 1
to 1
bend 1
pityingly 1
over 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
great 1
agony 1
came 1
and 1
thus 1
_she_ 1
would 1
see 1
him 1
when 1
she 1
looked 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
glad 1
morning 1
and 1
oh 1
would 1
she 1
drop 1
one 1
little 1
tear 1
upon 1
his 1
poor 1
lifeless 1
form 1
would 1
she 1
heave 1
one 1
little 1
sigh 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
bright 1
young 1
life 1
so 1
rudely 1
blighted 1
so 1
untimely 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
window 1
went 1
up 1
a 1
maidservants 1
discordant 1
voice 1
profaned 1
the 1
holy 1
calm 1
and 1
a 1
deluge 1
of 1
water 1
drenched 1
the 1
prone 1
martyrs 1
remains 1
the 1
strangling 1
hero 1
sprang 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
relieving 1
snort 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
whiz 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
missile 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
mingled 1
with 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
a 1
curse 1
a 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
shivering 1
glass 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
vague 1
form 1
went 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
shot 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
not 1
long 1
after 1
as 1
tom 1
all 1
undressed 1
for 1
bed 1
was 1
surveying 1
his 1
drenched 1
garments 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
tallow 1
dip 1
sid 1
woke 1
up 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
any 1
dim 1
idea 1
of 1
making 1
any 1
references 1
to 1
allusions 1
he 1
thought 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
peace 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
danger 1
in 1
toms 1
eye 1
tom 1
turned 1
in 1
without 1
the 1
added 1
vexation 1
of 1
prayers 1
and 1
sid 1
made 1
mental 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
omission 1
chapter 1
iv 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
upon 1
a 1
tranquil 1
world 1
and 1
beamed 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
peaceful 1
village 1
like 1
a 1
benediction 1
breakfast 1
over 1
aunt 1
polly 1
had 1
family 1
worship 1
it 1
began 1
with 1
a 1
prayer 1
built 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
up 1
of 1
solid 1
courses 1
of 1
scriptural 1
quotations 1
welded 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
thin 1
mortar 1
of 1
originality 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
delivered 1
a 1
grim 1
chapter 1
of 1
the 1
mosaic 1
law 1
as 1
from 1
sinai 1
then 1
tom 1
girded 1
up 1
his 1
loins 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
verses 1
sid 1
had 1
learned 1
his 1
lesson 1
days 1
before 1
tom 1
bent 1
all 1
his 1
energies 1
to 1
the 1
memorizing 1
of 1
five 1
verses 1
and 1
he 1
chose 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
sermon 1
on 1
the 1
mount 1
because 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
no 1
verses 1
that 1
were 1
shorter 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
tom 1
had 1
a 1
vague 1
general 1
idea 1
of 1
his 1
lesson 1
but 1
no 1
more 1
for 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
traversing 1
the 1
whole 1
field 1
of 1
human 1
thought 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
were 1
busy 1
with 1
distracting 1
recreations 1
mary 1
took 1
his 1
book 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
recite 1
and 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1

mary 1
all 1

ill 1

and 1
he 1
did 1
tackle 1
it 1
againand 1
under 1
the 1
double 1
pressure 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
prospective 1
gain 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
with 1
such 1
spirit 1
that 1
he 1
accomplished 1
a 1
shining 1
success 1
mary 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
brandnew 1
barlow 1
knife 1
worth 1
twelve 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
cents 1
and 1
the 1
convulsion 1
of 1
delight 1
that 1
swept 1
his 1
system 1
shook 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
foundations 1
true 1
the 1
knife 1
would 1
not 1
cut 1
anything 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sureenough 1
barlow 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
inconceivable 1
grandeur 1
in 1
thatthough 1
where 1
the 1
western 1
boys 1
ever 1
got 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
weapon 1
could 1
possibly 1
be 1
counterfeited 1
to 1
its 1
injury 1
is 1
an 1
imposing 1
mystery 1
and 1
will 1
always 1
remain 1
so 1
perhaps 1
tom 1
contrived 1
to 1
scarify 1
the 1
cupboard 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
arranging 1
to 1
begin 1
on 1
the 1
bureau 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
off 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
sundayschool 1
mary 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
tin 1
basin 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
soap 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
basin 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
bench 1
there 1
then 1
he 1
dipped 1
the 1
soap 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
down 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
sleeves 1
poured 1
out 1
the 1
water 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
gently 1
and 1
then 1
entered 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
wipe 1
his 1
face 1
diligently 1
on 1
the 1
towel 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
mary 1
removed 1
the 1
towel 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
aint 1
you 1
ashamed 1
tom 1
you 1
mustnt 1
be 1
so 1
bad 1
water 1
wont 1
hurt 1
you 1
tom 1
was 1
a 1
trifle 1
disconcerted 1
the 1
basin 1
was 1
refilled 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
stood 1
over 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
gathering 1
resolution 1
took 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
breath 1
and 1
began 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
kitchen 1
presently 1
with 1
both 1
eyes 1
shut 1
and 1
groping 1
for 1
the 1
towel 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
an 1
honorable 1
testimony 1
of 1
suds 1
and 1
water 1
was 1
dripping 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
towel 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
satisfactory 1
for 1
the 1
clean 1
territory 1
stopped 1
short 1
at 1
his 1
chin 1
and 1
his 1
jaws 1
like 1
a 1
mask 1
below 1
and 1
beyond 1
this 1
line 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dark 1
expanse 1
of 1
unirrigated 1
soil 1
that 1
spread 1
downward 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
backward 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
mary 1
took 1
him 1
in 1
hand 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
done 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
brother 1
without 1
distinction 1
of 1
color 1
and 1
his 1
saturated 1
hair 1
was 1
neatly 1
brushed 1
and 1
its 1
short 1
curls 1
wrought 1
into 1
a 1
dainty 1
and 1
symmetrical 1
general 1
effect 1
he 1
privately 1
smoothed 1
out 1
the 1
curls 1
with 1
labor 1
and 1
difficulty 1
and 1
plastered 1
his 1
hair 1
close 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
he 1
held 1
curls 1
to 1
be 1
effeminate 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
filled 1
his 1
life 1
with 1
bitterness 1
then 1
mary 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
his 1
clothing 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
used 1
only 1
on 1
sundays 1
during 1
two 1
yearsthey 1
were 1
simply 1
called 1
his 1
other 1
clothesand 1
so 1
by 1
that 1
we 1
know 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
the 1
girl 1
put 1
him 1
to 1
rights 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
dressed 1
himself 1
she 1
buttoned 1
his 1
neat 1
roundabout 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
chin 1
turned 1
his 1
vast 1
shirt 1
collar 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
brushed 1
him 1
off 1
and 1
crowned 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
speckled 1
straw 1
hat 1
he 1
now 1
looked 1
exceedingly 1
improved 1
and 1
uncomfortable 1
he 1
was 1
fully 1
as 1
uncomfortable 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
restraint 1
about 1
whole 1
clothes 1
and 1
cleanliness 1
that 1
galled 1
him 1
he 1
hoped 1
that 1
mary 1
would 1
forget 1
his 1
shoes 1
but 1
the 1
hope 1
was 1
blighted 1
she 1
coated 1
them 1
thoroughly 1
with 1
tallow 1
as 1
was 1
the 1
custom 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
out 1
he 1
lost 1
his 1
temper 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
being 1
made 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
he 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
mary 1
said 1
persuasively 1
please 1
tomthats 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
so 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
shoes 1
snarling 1
mary 1
was 1
soon 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
children 1
set 1
out 1
for 1
sundayschoola 1
place 1
that 1
tom 1
hated 1
with 1
his 1
whole 1
heart 1
but 1
sid 1
and 1
mary 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
it 1
sabbathschool 1
hours 1
were 1
from 1
nine 1
to 1
halfpast 1

and 1
then 1

two 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
always 1
remained 1
for 1
the 1
sermon 1
voluntarily 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
always 1
remained 1
toofor 1

seat 1
about 1
three 1

the 1
edifice 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
plain 1
affair 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pine 1

treebox 1
on 1

of 1

for 1

see 1
em 1
tom 1
exhibited 1
they 1
were 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
the 1
property 1
changed 1
hands 1
then 1
tom 1
traded 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
white 1
alleys 1
for 1
three 1
red 1
tickets 1
and 1
some 1
small 1
trifle 1
or 1
other 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
blue 1
ones 1
he 1
waylaid 1
other 1
boys 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
buying 1
tickets 1
of 1
various 1
colors 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
longer 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
church 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
clean 1
and 1
noisy 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
proceeded 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
started 1
a 1
quarrel 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
boy 1
that 1
came 1
handy 1
the 1
teacher 1
a 1
grave 1
elderly 1
man 1
interfered 1
then 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
tom 1
pulled 1
a 1
boys 1
hair 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
bench 1
and 1
was 1
absorbed 1
in 1
his 1
book 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
turned 1
around 1
stuck 1
a 1
pin 1
in 1
another 1
boy 1
presently 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
say 1
ouch 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
new 1
reprimand 1
from 1
his 1
teacher 1
toms 1
whole 1
class 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
patternrestless 1
noisy 1
and 1
troublesome 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
recite 1
their 1
lessons 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
knew 1
his 1
verses 1
perfectly 1
but 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
prompted 1
all 1
along 1
however 1
they 1
worried 1
through 1
and 1
each 1
got 1
his 1
rewardin 1
small 1
blue 1
tickets 1
each 1
with 1
a 1
passage 1
of 1
scripture 1
on 1
it 1
each 1
blue 1
ticket 1
was 1
pay 1
for 1
two 1
verses 1
of 1
the 1
recitation 1
ten 1
blue 1
tickets 1
equalled 1
a 1
red 1
one 1
and 1
could 1
be 1
exchanged 1
for 1
it 1
ten 1
red 1
tickets 1
equalled 1
a 1
yellow 1
one 1
for 1
ten 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
the 1
superintendent 1
gave 1
a 1
very 1
plainly 1
bound 1
bible 1
worth 1
forty 1
cents 1
in 1
those 1
easy 1
times 1
to 1
the 1
pupil 1
how 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
readers 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
industry 1
and 1
application 1
to 1
memorize 1
two 1
thousand 1
verses 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
dore 1
bible 1
and 1
yet 1
mary 1
had 1
acquired 1
two 1
bibles 1
in 1
this 1
wayit 1
was 1
the 1
patient 1
work 1
of 1
two 1
yearsand 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
german 1
parentage 1
had 1
won 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
he 1
once 1
recited 1
three 1
thousand 1
verses 1
without 1
stopping 1
but 1
the 1
strain 1
upon 1
his 1
mental 1
faculties 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
little 1
better 1
than 1
an 1
idiot 1
from 1
that 1
day 1
fortha 1
grievous 1
misfortune 1
for 1
the 1
school 1
for 1
on 1
great 1
occasions 1
before 1
company 1
the 1
superintendent 1
as 1
tom 1
expressed 1
it 1
had 1
always 1
made 1
this 1
boy 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
only 1
the 1
older 1
pupils 1
managed 1
to 1
keep 1
their 1
tickets 1
and 1
stick 1
to 1
their 1
tedious 1
work 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
bible 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
delivery 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
prizes 1
was 1
a 1
rare 1
and 1
noteworthy 1
circumstance 1
the 1
successful 1
pupil 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
and 1
conspicuous 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
every 1
scholars 1
heart 1
was 1
fired 1
with 1
a 1
fresh 1
ambition 1
that 1
often 1
lasted 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
weeks 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
toms 1
mental 1
stomach 1
had 1
never 1
really 1
hungered 1
for 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
prizes 1
but 1
unquestionably 1
his 1
entire 1
being 1
had 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
day 1
longed 1
for 1
the 1
glory 1
and 1
the 1
eclat 1
that 1
came 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
due 1
course 1
the 1
superintendent 1
stood 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
pulpit 1
with 1
a 1
closed 1
hymnbook 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
his 1
forefinger 1
inserted 1
between 1
its 1
leaves 1
and 1
commanded 1
attention 1
when 1
a 1
sundayschool 1
superintendent 1
makes 1
his 1
customary 1
little 1
speech 1
a 1
hymnbook 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
is 1
as 1
necessary 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
inevitable 1
sheet 1
of 1
music 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
a 1
singer 1
who 1
stands 1
forward 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
sings 1
a 1
solo 1
at 1
a 1
concertthough 1
why 1
is 1
a 1
mystery 1
for 1
neither 1
the 1
hymnbook 1
nor 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
music 1
is 1
ever 1
referred 1
to 1
by 1
the 1
sufferer 1
this 1
superintendent 1
was 1
a 1
slim 1
creature 1
of 1
thirtyfive 1
with 1
a 1
sandy 1
goatee 1
and 1
short 1
sandy 1
hair 1
he 1
wore 1
a 1
stiff 1
standingcollar 1
whose 1
upper 1
edge 1
almost 1
reached 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
whose 1
sharp 1
points 1
curved 1
forward 1
abreast 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
his 1
moutha 1
fence 1
that 1
compelled 1
a 1
straight 1
lookout 1
ahead 1
and 1
a 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
body 1
when 1
a 1
side 1
view 1
was 1
required 1
his 1
chin 1
was 1
propped 1
on 1
a 1
spreading 1
cravat 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
broad 1
and 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
a 1
banknote 1
and 1
had 1
fringed 1
ends 1
his 1
boot 1
toes 1
were 1
turned 1
sharply 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
like 1
sleighrunnersan 1
effect 1
patiently 1
and 1
laboriously 1
produced 1
by 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
by 1
sitting 1
with 1
their 1
toes 1
pressed 1
against 1
a 1
wall 1
for 1
hours 1
together 1
mr 1
walters 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
of 1
mien 1
and 1
very 1
sincere 1
and 1
honest 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
held 1
sacred 1
things 1
and 1
places 1
in 1
such 1
reverence 1
and 1
so 1
separated 1
them 1
from 1
worldly 1
matters 1
that 1
unconsciously 1
to 1
himself 1
his 1
sundayschool 1
voice 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
peculiar 1
intonation 1
which 1
was 1
wholly 1
absent 1
on 1
weekdays 1
he 1
began 1
after 1
this 1
fashion 1
now 1
children 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
all 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
just 1
as 1
straight 1
and 1
pretty 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
all 1
your 1
attention 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
therethat 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
good 1
little 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
should 1
do 1
i 1
see 1
one 1
little 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
windowi 1
am 1
afraid 1
she 1
thinks 1
i 1
am 1
out 1
there 1
somewhereperhaps 1
up 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
making 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
applausive 1
titter 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
good 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
to 1
see 1
so 1
many 1
bright 1
clean 1
little 1
faces 1
assembled 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
like 1
this 1
learning 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
and 1
be 1
good 1
and 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
necessary 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
oration 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
pattern 1
which 1
does 1
not 1
vary 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
the 1
latter 1
third 1
of 1
the 1
speech 1
was 1
marred 1
by 1
the 1
resumption 1
of 1
fights 1
and 1
other 1
recreations 1
among 1
certain 1
of 1
the 1
bad 1
boys 1
and 1
by 1
fidgetings 1
and 1
whisperings 1
that 1
extended 1
far 1
and 1
wide 1
washing 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
bases 1
of 1
isolated 1
and 1
incorruptible 1
rocks 1
like 1
sid 1
and 1
mary 1
but 1
now 1
every 1
sound 1
ceased 1
suddenly 1
with 1
the 1
subsidence 1
of 1
mr 1
walters 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
the 1
speech 1
was 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
burst 1
of 1
silent 1
gratitude 1
a 1
good 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
whispering 1
had 1
been 1
occasioned 1
by 1
an 1
event 1
which 1
was 1
more 1
or 1
less 1

business 1
up 1
at 1
the 1

by 1

it 1
was 1
business 1
that 1
frequently 1

to 1

done 1
over 1
again 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
with 1
much 1
seeming 1
vexation 1
the 1
little 1

and 1
the 1
little 1
boys 1
showed 1
off 1
with 1
such 1
diligence 1
that 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
thick 1
with 1
paper 1
wads 1
and 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
scufflings 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
great 1
man 1
sat 1
and 1
beamed 1
a 1
majestic 1
judicial 1
smile 1
upon 1
all 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
warmed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
grandeurfor 1
he 1
was 1
showing 1
off 1
too 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
mr 1
walters 1
ecstasy 1
complete 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
deliver 1
a 1
bibleprize 1
and 1
exhibit 1
a 1
prodigy 1
several 1
pupils 1
had 1
a 1
few 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
but 1
none 1
had 1
enoughhe 1
had 1
been 1
around 1
among 1
the 1
star 1
pupils 1
inquiring 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
worlds 1
now 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
german 1
lad 1
back 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
sound 1

and 1
now 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
when 1
hope 1
was 1
dead 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
came 1
forward 1
with 1
nine 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
nine 1
red 1
tickets 1
and 1
ten 1
blue 1
ones 1
and 1
demanded 1
a 1
bible 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
thunderbolt 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
clear 1
sky 1
walters 1
was 1
not 1
expecting 1
an 1
application 1
from 1
this 1
source 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
ten 1
years 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
ithere 1
were 1
the 1
certified 1
checks 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
good 1
for 1
their 1
face 1
tom 1
was 1
therefore 1
elevated 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
elect 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
was 1
announced 1
from 1
headquarters 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
stunning 1
surprise 1
of 1
the 1
decade 1
and 1
so 1
profound 1
was 1
the 1
sensation 1
that 1
it 1
lifted 1
the 1
new 1
hero 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
judicial 1
ones 1
altitude 1
and 1
the 1
school 1
had 1
two 1
marvels 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
in 1
place 1
of 1
one 1
the 1
boys 1
were 1
all 1
eaten 1
up 1
with 1
envybut 1
those 1
that 1
suffered 1
the 1
bitterest 1
pangs 1
were 1
those 1
who 1
perceived 1
too 1
late 1
that 1
they 1
themselves 1
had 1
contributed 1
to 1
this 1
hated 1
splendor 1
by 1
trading 1
tickets 1
to 1
tom 1
for 1
the 1
wealth 1
he 1
had 1
amassed 1
in 1
selling 1
whitewashing 1
privileges 1
these 1
despised 1
themselves 1
as 1
being 1
the 1
dupes 1
of 1
a 1
wily 1
fraud 1
a 1
guileful 1
snake 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
the 1
prize 1
was 1
delivered 1
to 1
tom 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
effusion 1
as 1
the 1
superintendent 1
could 1
pump 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
but 1
it 1
lacked 1
somewhat 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
gush 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
fellows 1
instinct 1
taught 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
here 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
well 1
bear 1
the 1
light 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
preposterous 1
that 1
this 1
boy 1
had 1
warehoused 1
two 1
thousand 1
sheaves 1
of 1
scriptural 1
wisdom 1
on 1
his 1
premisesa 1
dozen 1
would 1
strain 1
his 1
capacity 1
without 1
a 1
doubt 1
amy 1
lawrence 1
was 1
proud 1
and 1
glad 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
tom 1
see 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
facebut 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
look 1
she 1
wondered 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
grain 1
troubled 1
next 1
a 1
dim 1
suspicion 1
came 1
and 1
wentcame 1
again 1
she 1
watched 1
a 1
furtive 1
glance 1
told 1
her 1
worldsand 1
then 1
her 1
heart 1
broke 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
jealous 1
and 1
angry 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
hated 1
everybody 1
tom 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
she 1
thought 1
tom 1
was 1
introduced 1
to 1
the 1
judge 1
but 1
his 1
tongue 1
was 1
tied 1
his 1
breath 1
would 1
hardly 1
come 1
his 1
heart 1
quakedpartly 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
greatness 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
but 1
mainly 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
her 1
parent 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
fall 1
down 1
and 1
worship 1
him 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
the 1
judge 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
toms 1
head 1
and 1
called 1
him 1
a 1
fine 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
the 1
boy 1
stammered 1
gasped 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
out 1

and 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
boys 1
who 1
had 1
as 1
snobs 1
the 1
congregation 1
being 1
fully 1
assembled 1
now 1
the 1
bell 1
rang 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
warn 1
laggards 1
and 1
stragglers 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
solemn 1
hush 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
church 1
which 1
was 1
only 1
broken 1
by 1
the 1
tittering 1
and 1
whispering 1
of 1
the 1
choir 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
the 1
choir 1
always 1
tittered 1
and 1
whispered 1
all 1
through 1
service 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
church 1
choir 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
illbred 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
forgotten 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
scarcely 1
remember 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
some 1
foreign 1
country 1
the 1
minister 1
gave 1
out 1
the 1
hymn 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
through 1
with 1
a 1
relish 1
in 1
a 1
peculiar 1
style 1
which 1
was 1
much 1
admired 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
his 1
voice 1
began 1
on 1
a 1
medium 1
key 1
and 1
climbed 1
steadily 1
up 1
till 1
it 1
reached 1
a 1
certain 1
point 1
where 1
it 1
bore 1
with 1
strong 1
emphasis 1
upon 1
the 1
topmost 1
word 1
and 1
then 1
plunged 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
from 1
a 1
springboard 1
shall 1
i 1
be 1
carried 1
toe 1
the 1
skies 1
on 1
flowry 1
_beds_ 1
of 1
ease 1
whilst 1
others 1
fight 1
to 1
win 1
the 1
prize 1
and 1
sail 1
thro 1
_blood_y 1
seas 1
he 1
was 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
reader 1
at 1
church 1
sociables 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
read 1
poetry 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
through 1
the 1
ladies 1
would 1
lift 1
up 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
fall 1
helplessly 1
in 1
their 1
laps 1
and 1
wall 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
shake 1
their 1
heads 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
words 1
cannot 1
express 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
beautiful 1
too 1
beautiful 1
for 1
this 1
mortal 1
earth 1
after 1
the 1
hymn 1
had 1
been 1
sung 1
the 1
rev 1
mr 1
sprague 1
turned 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
bulletinboard 1
and 1
read 1
off 1
notices 1
of 1
meetings 1
and 1
societies 1
and 1
things 1
till 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
the 1
list 1
would 1
stretch 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
of 1
dooma 1
queer 1
custom 1
which 1
is 1
still 1
kept 1
up 1
in 1
america 1
even 1
in 1
cities 1
away 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
age 1
of 1
abundant 1
newspapers 1
often 1
the 1
less 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
justify 1
a 1
traditional 1
custom 1
the 1
harder 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
minister 1
prayed 1
a 1
good 1
generous 1
prayer 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
details 1
it 1
pleaded 1
for 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
children 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
churches 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
for 1

for 1

for 1
the 1
president 1
for 1
the 1
officers 1
of 1
the 1
government 1
for 1
poor 1
sailors 1
tossed 1
by 1
stormy 1
seas 1
for 1
the 1
oppressed 1
millions 1
groaning 1
under 1
the 1
heel 1
of 1
european 1
monarchies 1
and 1
oriental 1
despotisms 1
for 1
such 1
as 1
have 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
tidings 1
and 1
yet 1
have 1
not 1
eyes 1
to 1
see 1
nor 1
ears 1
to 1
hear 1
withal 1
for 1
the 1
heathen 1
in 1
the 1
far 1
islands 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
supplication 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
speak 1
might 1
find 1
grace 1
and 1
favor 1
and 1
be 1
as 1
seed 1
sown 1
in 1
fertile 1
ground 1
yielding 1
in 1
time 1
a 1
grateful 1
harvest 1
of 1
good 1
amen 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rustling 1
of 1
dresses 1
and 1
the 1
standing 1
congregation 1
sat 1
down 1
the 1
boy 1
whose 1
history 1
this 1
book 1
relates 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
the 1
prayer 1
he 1
only 1
endured 1
itif 1
he 1
even 1
did 1
that 1
much 1
he 1
was 1
restive 1
all 1
through 1
it 1
he 1
kept 1
tally 1
of 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
prayer 1
unconsciouslyfor 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
listening 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
ground 1
of 1
old 1
and 1
the 1
clergymans 1
regular 1
route 1
over 1
itand 1
when 1
a 1
little 1
trifle 1
of 1
new 1
matter 1
was 1
interlarded 1
his 1
ear 1
detected 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
whole 1
nature 1
resented 1
it 1
he 1
considered 1
additions 1
unfair 1
and 1
scoundrelly 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
prayer 1
a 1
fly 1
had 1
lit 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
pew 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
tortured 1
his 1
spirit 1
by 1
calmly 1
rubbing 1
its 1
hands 1
together 1
embracing 1
its 1
head 1
with 1
its 1
arms 1
and 1
polishing 1
it 1
so 1
vigorously 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
almost 1
part 1
company 1
with 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
the 1
slender 1
thread 1
of 1
a 1
neck 1
was 1
exposed 1
to 1
view 1
scraping 1
its 1
wings 1
with 1
its 1
hind 1
legs 1
and 1
smoothing 1
them 1
to 1
its 1
body 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
coattails 1
going 1
through 1
its 1
whole 1
toilet 1
as 1
tranquilly 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
knew 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
safe 1
as 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
as 1
sorely 1
as 1
toms 1
hands 1
itched 1
to 1
grab 1
for 1
it 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
darehe 1
believed 1
his 1
soul 1
would 1
be 1
instantly 1
destroyed 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
while 1
the 1
prayer 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
but 1
with 1
the 1
closing 1
sentence 1
his 1
hand 1
began 1
to 1
curve 1
and 1
steal 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
instant 1
the 1
amen 1
was 1
out 1
the 1
fly 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
of 1
war 1
his 1
aunt 1
detected 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
the 1
minister 1
gave 1
out 1
his 1
text 1
and 1
droned 1
along 1
monotonously 1
through 1
an 1
argument 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
prosy 1
that 1
many 1
a 1
head 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
began 1
to 1
nodand 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
argument 1
that 1
dealt 1
in 1
limitless 1
fire 1
and 1
brimstone 1
and 1
thinned 1
the 1
predestined 1
elect 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
company 1
so 1
small 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
hardly 1
worth 1
the 1
saving 1
tom 1
counted 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
the 1
sermon 1
after 1
church 1
he 1
always 1
knew 1
how 1
many 1
pages 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
he 1
seldom 1
knew 1
anything 1
else 1
about 1
the 1
discourse 1
however 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
really 1
interested 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
the 1
minister 1
made 1
a 1
grand 1
and 1
moving 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
assembling 1
together 1
of 1
the 1
worlds 1
hosts 1
at 1
the 1
millennium 1
when 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
the 1
lamb 1
should 1
lie 1
down 1
together 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
should 1
lead 1
them 1
but 1
the 1
pathos 1
the 1
lesson 1
the 1
moral 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
spectacle 1
were 1
lost 1
upon 1
the 1
boy 1
he 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
conspicuousness 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
character 1
before 1
the 1
onlooking 1
nations 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
that 1
child 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
tame 1
lion 1
now 1
he 1
lapsed 1
into 1
suffering 1
again 1
as 1
the 1
dry 1
argument 1
was 1
resumed 1
presently 1
he 1
bethought 1
him 1
of 1
a 1
treasure 1
he 1
had 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
beetle 1
with 1
formidable 1
jawsa 1
pinchbug 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
percussioncap 1
box 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
the 1
beetle 1
did 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
finger 1
a 1
natural 1
fillip 1
followed 1
the 1
beetle 1
went 1
floundering 1
into 1
the 1
aisle 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
hurt 1
finger 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
boys 1
mouth 1
the 1
beetle 1
lay 1
there 1
working 1
its 1
helpless 1
legs 1
unable 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
tom 1
eyed 1
it 1
and 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
safe 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
reach 1
other 1
people 1
uninterested 1
in 1
the 1
sermon 1
found 1
relief 1
in 1
the 1
beetle 1
and 1
they 1
eyed 1
it 1
too 1
presently 1
a 1
vagrant 1
poodle 1
dog 1
came 1
idling 1
along 1
sad 1
at 1
heart 1
lazy 1
with 1
the 1
summer 1
softness 1
and 1
the 1
quiet 1
weary 1
of 1
captivity 1
sighing 1
for 1
change 1
he 1
spied 1
the 1
beetle 1
the 1
drooping 1
tail 1
lifted 1
and 1
wagged 1
he 1
surveyed 1
the 1
prize 1
walked 1
around 1
it 1
smelt 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
a 1
safe 1
distance 1
walked 1
around 1
it 1
again 1
grew 1
bolder 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
closer 1
smell 1
then 1
lifted 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
gingerly 1
snatch 1
at 1
it 1
just 1
missing 1
it 1
made 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
began 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
diversion 1
subsided 1
to 1
his 1
stomach 1
with 1
the 1
beetle 1
between 1
his 1
paws 1
and 1
continued 1
his 1
experiments 1
grew 1
weary 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
then 1
indifferent 1
and 1
absentminded 1
his 1
head 1
nodded 1
and 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
his 1
chin 1
descended 1
and 1
touched 1
the 1
enemy 1
who 1
seized 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sharp 1
yelp 1
a 1
flirt 1
of 1
the 1
poodles 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
beetle 1
fell 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
yards 1
away 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
neighboring 1
spectators 1
shook 1
with 1
a 1
gentle 1
inward 1
joy 1
several 1
faces 1
went 1
behind 1
fans 1
and 1
handkerchiefs 1
and 1
tom 1
was 1
entirely 1
happy 1
the 1
dog 1
looked 1
foolish 1
and 1
probably 1
felt 1
so 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
resentment 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
too 1
and 1
a 1
craving 1
for 1
revenge 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
beetle 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
wary 1
attack 1
on 1
it 1
again 1
jumping 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
a 1
circle 1
lighting 1
with 1
his 1
forepaws 1
within 1
an 1
inch 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
making 1
even 1
closer 1
snatches 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
jerking 1
his 1
head 1
till 1
his 1
ears 1
flapped 1
again 1
but 1
he 1
grew 1
tired 1
once 1
more 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
tried 1
to 1
amuse 1
himself 1
with 1
a 1
fly 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
relief 1
followed 1
an 1
ant 1
around 1
with 1
his 1
nose 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
quickly 1
wearied 1
of 1
that 1
yawned 1
sighed 1
forgot 1
the 1
beetle 1
entirely 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
it 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
yelp 1
of 1
agony 1
and 1
the 1
poodle 1
went 1
sailing 1
up 1
the 1
aisle 1
the 1
yelps 1
continued 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
the 1
dog 1
he 1
crossed 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
altar 1
he 1
flew 1
down 1
the 1
other 1
aisle 1
he 1
crossed 1
before 1
the 1
doors 1
he 1
clamored 1
up 1
the 1
homestretch 1
his 1
anguish 1
grew 1
with 1
his 1
progress 1
till 1
presently 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
woolly 1
comet 1
moving 1
in 1
its 1
orbit 1
with 1
the 1
gleam 1
and 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
light 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
frantic 1
sufferer 1
sheered 1
from 1
its 1
course 1
and 1
sprang 1
into 1
its 1
masters 1
lap 1
he 1
flung 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
distress 1
quickly 1
thinned 1
away 1
and 1
died 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
whole 1
church 1
was 1
redfaced 1
and 1
suffocating 1
with 1
suppressed 1
laughter 1
and 1
the 1
sermon 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
dead 1
standstill 1
the 1
discourse 1
was 1
resumed 1
presently 1
but 1
it 1
went 1
lame 1
and 1
halting 1
all 1
possibility 1
of 1
impressiveness 1
being 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
even 1
the 1
gravest 1
sentiments 1
were 1
constantly 1
being 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
smothered 1
burst 1
of 1
unholy 1
mirth 1
under 1
cover 1
of 1
some 1
remote 1
pewback 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
poor 1
parson 1
had 1
said 1
a 1
rarely 1
facetious 1
thing 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
genuine 1
relief 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
congregation 1
when 1
the 1
ordeal 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
the 1
benediction 1
pronounced 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
went 1
home 1
quite 1
cheerful 1
thinking 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
satisfaction 1
about 1
divine 1
service 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
variety 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
marring 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
that 1
the 1
dog 1
should 1
play 1
with 1
his 1
pinchbug 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
upright 1
in 1
him 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
off 1

miserable 1
monday 1
morning 1
always 1
found 1
him 1
sobecause 1
it 1
began 1
another 1
weeks 1
slow 1
suffering 1
in 1
school 1
he 1
generally 1
began 1
that 1
day 1
with 1
wishing 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
intervening 1
holiday 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
going 1
into 1
captivity 1
and 1
fetters 1
again 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
odious 1
tom 1
lay 1
thinking 1
presently 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
was 1
sick 1
then 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
home 1
from 1
school 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
vague 1
possibility 1
he 1
canvassed 1
his 1
system 1
no 1
ailment 1
was 1
found 1
and 1
he 1
investigated 1
again 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
detect 1
colicky 1
symptoms 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
encourage 1
them 1
with 1
considerable 1
hope 1
but 1
they 1
soon 1
grew 1
feeble 1
and 1
presently 1
died 1
wholly 1
away 1
he 1
reflected 1
further 1
suddenly 1
he 1
discovered 1
something 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
upper 1
front 1
teeth 1
was 1
loose 1
this 1
was 1
lucky 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
begin 1
to 1
groan 1
as 1
a 1
starter 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
court 1
with 1
that 1
argument 1
his 1
aunt 1
would 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
that 1
would 1
hurt 1
so 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
hold 1
the 1
tooth 1
in 1
reserve 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
and 1
seek 1
further 1
nothing 1
offered 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
remembered 1
hearing 1
the 1
doctor 1
tell 1
about 1
a 1
certain 1
thing 1
that 1
laid 1
up 1
a 1
patient 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
threatened 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
lose 1
a 1
finger 1
so 1
the 1
boy 1
eagerly 1
drew 1
his 1
sore 1
toe 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
for 1
inspection 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
necessary 1
symptoms 1
however 1
it 1
seemed 1
well 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
chance 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
fell 1
to 1
groaning 1
with 1
considerable 1
spirit 1
but 1
sid 1
slept 1
on 1
unconscious 1
tom 1
groaned 1
louder 1
and 1
fancied 1
that 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
pain 1
in 1
the 1
toe 1
no 1
result 1
from 1
sid 1
tom 1
was 1
panting 1
with 1
his 1
exertions 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
rest 1
and 1
then 1
swelled 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
fetched 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
admirable 1
groans 1
sid 1
snored 1
on 1
tom 1
was 1
aggravated 1
he 1
said 1
sid 1
sid 1
and 1
shook 1
him 1
this 1
course 1
worked 1
well 1
and 1
tom 1
began 1
to 1
groan 1
again 1
sid 1
yawned 1
stretched 1
then 1
brought 1
himself 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
snort 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stare 1
at 1
tom 1
tom 1
went 1
on 1
groaning 1
sid 1
said 1
tom 1
say 1
tom 1
no 1
response 1

matter 1

and 1
he 1
shook 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
anxiously 1

sid 1

snatched 1
his 1

gone 1
tom 1
was 1
suffering 1
in 1
reality 1
now 1
so 1
handsomely 1
was 1
his 1
imagination 1
working 1
and 1
so 1
his 1
groans 1
had 1
gathered 1
quite 1
a 1
genuine 1
tone 1
sid 1
flew 1
downstairs 1
and 1
said 1

sid 1
and 1
mary 1
at 1
her 1
heels 1
and 1
her 1
face 1
grew 1
white 1
too 1
and 1
her 1
lip 1
trembled 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
bedside 1
she 1
gasped 1
out 1

the 1

sank 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
a 1
little 1
then 1
cried 1
a 1
little 1
then 1
did 1
both 1
together 1
this 1
restored 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
said 1

shut 1
up 1
that 1
nonsense 1
and 1
climb 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
the 1
groans 1
ceased 1
and 1
the 1
pain 1
vanished 1
from 1
the 1
toe 1
the 1
boy 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
foolish 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
aunt 1
polly 1

_seemed_ 1

that 1
mary 1
get 1
me 1
a 1
silk 1
thread 1
and 1
a 1
chunk 1
of 1
fire 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
tom 1
said 1
oh 1
please 1
auntie 1

oh 1

dont 1
dont 1
you 1
so 1
all 1
this 1
row 1
was 1
because 1
you 1
thought 1
youd 1
get 1
to 1
stay 1
home 1
from 1
school 1
and 1
go 1
afishing 1
tom 1
tom 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
so 1
and 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
try 1
every 1
way 1
you 1
can 1
to 1
break 1
my 1
old 1
heart 1
with 1
your 1
outrageousness 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
dental 1
instruments 1
were 1
ready 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
made 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
silk 1
thread 1
fast 1
to 1
toms 1
tooth 1
with 1
a 1
loop 1
and 1
tied 1
the 1
other 1
to 1
the 1
bedpost 1
then 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
chunk 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
suddenly 1
thrust 1
it 1
almost 1
into 1
the 1
boys 1
face 1
the 1
tooth 1
hung 1
dangling 1
by 1
the 1
bedpost 1
now 1
but 1
all 1
trials 1
bring 1
their 1
compensations 1
as 1
tom 1
wended 1
to 1
school 1
after 1
breakfast 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
every 1
boy 1
he 1
met 1
because 1
the 1
gap 1
in 1
his 1
upper 1
row 1
of 1
teeth 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
expectorate 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
admirable 1
way 1
he 1
gathered 1
quite 1
a 1
following 1
of 1
lads 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
exhibition 1
and 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
centre 1
of 1
fascination 1
and 1
homage 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
now 1
found 1
himself 1
suddenly 1
without 1
an 1
adherent 1
and 1
shorn 1
of 1
his 1
glory 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
disdain 1
which 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
it 1
wasnt 1
anything 1
to 1
spit 1
like 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
but 1
another 1
boy 1
said 1
sour 1
grapes 1
and 1
he 1
wandered 1
away 1
a 1
dismantled 1
hero 1
shortly 1
tom 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
juvenile 1
pariah 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
huckleberry 1
finn 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
drunkard 1
huckleberry 1
was 1
cordially 1
hated 1
and 1
dreaded 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
mothers 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
idle 1
and 1
lawless 1
and 1
vulgar 1
and 1
badand 1
because 1
all 1
their 1
children 1
admired 1
him 1
so 1
and 1
delighted 1
in 1
his 1
forbidden 1
society 1
and 1
wished 1
they 1
dared 1
to 1
be 1
like 1
him 1
tom 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
respectable 1
boys 1
in 1
that 1
he 1
envied 1
huckleberry 1
his 1
gaudy 1
outcast 1
condition 1
and 1
was 1
under 1
strict 1
orders 1
not 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
played 1
with 1
him 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
huckleberry 1
was 1
always 1
dressed 1
in 1
the 1
castoff 1
clothes 1
of 1
fullgrown 1
men 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
perennial 1
bloom 1
and 1
fluttering 1
with 1
rags 1
his 1
hat 1
was 1
a 1
vast 1
ruin 1
with 1
a 1
wide 1
crescent 1
lopped 1
out 1
of 1
its 1
brim 1
his 1
coat 1
when 1
he 1
wore 1
one 1
hung 1
nearly 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
rearward 1
buttons 1
far 1
down 1
the 1
back 1
but 1
one 1
suspender 1
supported 1
his 1
trousers 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
the 1
trousers 1
bagged 1
low 1
and 1
contained 1
nothing 1
the 1
fringed 1
legs 1
dragged 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
when 1
not 1
rolled 1
up 1
huckleberry 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
he 1
slept 1
on 1
doorsteps 1
in 1
fine 1
weather 1
and 1
in 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
in 1
wet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
school 1
or 1
to 1
church 1
or 1
call 1
any 1
being 1
master 1
or 1
obey 1
anybody 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
fishing 1
or 1
swimming 1
when 1
and 1
where 1
he 1
chose 1
and 1
stay 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
suited 1
him 1
nobody 1
forbade 1
him 1
to 1
fight 1
he 1
could 1
sit 1
up 1
as 1
late 1
as 1
he 1
pleased 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
first 1
boy 1
that 1
went 1
barefoot 1
in 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
to 1
resume 1
leather 1
in 1
the 1
fall 1
he 1
never 1
had 1
to 1
wash 1
nor 1
put 1
on 1
clean 1
clothes 1
he 1
could 1
swear 1
wonderfully 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
everything 1
that 1
goes 1
to 1
make 1
life 1
precious 1
that 1
boy 1
had 1
so 1
thought 1

hampered 1

tom 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
carefully 1
unrolled 1
it 1
huckleberry 1
viewed 1
it 1
wistfully 1
the 1
temptation 1
was 1
very 1
strong 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
is 1
it 1
genuwyne 1
tom 1
lifted 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
showed 1
the 1
vacancy 1
well 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
huckleberry 1
its 1
a 1
trade 1
tom 1
enclosed 1
the 1
tick 1
in 1
the 1
percussioncap 1
box 1
that 1
had 1
lately 1
been 1
the 1
pinchbugs 1
prison 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
separated 1
each 1
feeling 1
wealthier 1
than 1
before 1
when 1
tom 1
reached 1
the 1
little 1
isolated 1
frame 1
schoolhouse 1
he 1
strode 1
in 1
briskly 1
with 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
come 1
with 1
all 1
honest 1
speed 1
he 1
hung 1
his 1
hat 1
on 1
a 1
peg 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
his 1
seat 1
with 1
businesslike 1
alacrity 1
the 1
master 1
throned 1
on 1
high 1
in 1
his 1
great 1
splintbottom 1
armchair 1
was 1
dozing 1
lulled 1
by 1
the 1
drowsy 1
hum 1
of 1
study 1
the 1
interruption 1
roused 1
him 1
thomas 1
sawyer 1
tom 1
knew 1
that 1
when 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
pronounced 1
in 1
full 1
it 1
meant 1
trouble 1
sir 1
come 1
up 1
here 1
now 1
sir 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
late 1
again 1
as 1
usual 1
tom 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
take 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
lie 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
long 1
tails 1
of 1
yellow 1
hair 1
hanging 1
down 1
a 1
back 1
that 1
he 1
recognized 1
by 1
the 1
electric 1
sympathy 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
form 1
was 1
_the 1
only 1
vacant 1
place_ 1
on 1
the 1
girls 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
he 1
instantly 1
said 1
_i 1
stopped 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
huckleberry 1
finn_ 1
the 1
masters 1
pulse 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
he 1
stared 1
helplessly 1
the 1
buzz 1
of 1
study 1
ceased 1
the 1
pupils 1
wondered 1
if 1
this 1
foolhardy 1
boy 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
mind 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
youyou 1
did 1
what 1
stopped 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
huckleberry 1
finn 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
mistaking 1
the 1
words 1
thomas 1
sawyer 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
astounding 1
confession 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
no 1
mere 1
ferule 1
will 1
answer 1
for 1
this 1
offence 1
take 1
off 1
your 1
jacket 1
the 1
masters 1
arm 1
performed 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
the 1
stock 1
of 1
switches 1
notably 1
diminished 1
then 1
the 1
order 1
followed 1
now 1
sir 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
with 1
the 1
girls 1
and 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
warning 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
titter 1
that 1
rippled 1
around 1
the 1
room 1
appeared 1
to 1
abash 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
in 1
reality 1
that 1
result 1
was 1
caused 1
rather 1
more 1
by 1
his 1
worshipful 1
awe 1
of 1
his 1
unknown 1
idol 1
and 1
the 1
dread 1
pleasure 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
his 1
high 1
good 1
fortune 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
pine 1
bench 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
hitched 1
herself 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
toss 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
nudges 1
and 1
winks 1
and 1
whispers 1
traversed 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
tom 1
sat 1
still 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
upon 1
the 1
long 1
low 1
desk 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
study 1
his 1
book 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
attention 1
ceased 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
accustomed 1
school 1
murmur 1
rose 1
upon 1
the 1
dull 1
air 1
once 1
more 1
presently 1
the 1
boy 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
furtive 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
girl 1
she 1
observed 1
it 1
made 1
a 1
mouth 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
when 1
she 1
cautiously 1
faced 1
around 1
again 1
a 1
peach 1
lay 1
before 1
her 1
she 1
thrust 1
it 1
away 1
tom 1
gently 1
put 1
it 1
back 1
she 1
thrust 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
but 1
with 1
less 1
animosity 1
tom 1
patiently 1
returned 1
it 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
then 1
she 1
let 1
it 1
remain 1
tom 1
scrawled 1
on 1
his 1
slate 1
please 1
take 1
iti 1
got 1
more 1
the 1
girl 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
words 1
but 1
made 1
no 1
sign 1
now 1
the 1
boy 1
began 1
to 1
draw 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
slate 1
hiding 1
his 1
work 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
hand 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
girl 1
refused 1
to 1
notice 1
but 1
her 1
human 1
curiosity 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
manifest 1
itself 1
by 1
hardly 1
perceptible 1
signs 1
the 1
boy 1
worked 1
on 1
apparently 1
unconscious 1
the 1
girl 1
made 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
noncommittal 1
attempt 1
to 1
see 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
did 1
not 1
betray 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
gave 1
in 1
and 1
hesitatingly 1
whispered 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
tom 1
partly 1
uncovered 1
a 1
dismal 1
caricature 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
with 1
two 1
gable 1
ends 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
corkscrew 1
of 1
smoke 1
issuing 1
from 1
the 1
chimney 1
then 1
the 1
girls 1
interest 1
began 1
to 1
fasten 1
itself 1
upon 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
she 1
forgot 1
everything 1
else 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
finished 1
she 1
gazed 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
whispered 1
its 1
nicemake 1
a 1
man 1
the 1
artist 1
erected 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
yard 1
that 1
resembled 1
a 1
derrick 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
stepped 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
not 1
hypercritical 1
she 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
the 1
monster 1
and 1
whispered 1
its 1
a 1
beautiful 1
mannow 1
make 1
me 1
coming 1
along 1
tom 1
drew 1
an 1
hourglass 1
with 1
a 1
full 1
moon 1
and 1
straw 1
limbs 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
armed 1
the 1
spreading 1
fingers 1
with 1
a 1
portentous 1
fan 1
the 1
girl 1
said 1
its 1

to 1

something 1
on 1
the 1
slate 1
hiding 1
the 1
words 1
from 1
the 1
girl 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
backward 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
begged 1

the 1
studio 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
rich 1
odour 1
of 1
roses 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
light 1
summer 1
wind 1
stirred 1
amidst 1
the 1
trees 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
the 1
heavy 1
scent 1
of 1
the 1
lilac 1
or 1
the 1
more 1
delicate 1
perfume 1
of 1
the 1
pinkflowering 1
thorn 1
from 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
divan 1
of 1
persian 1
saddlebags 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
lying 1
smoking 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
innumerable 1
cigarettes 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
could 1
just 1
catch 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
honeysweet 1
and 1
honeycoloured 1
blossoms 1
of 1
a 1
laburnum 1
whose 1
tremulous 1
branches 1
seemed 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
a 1
beauty 1
so 1
flamelike 1
as 1
theirs 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
of 1
birds 1
in 1
flight 1
flitted 1
across 1
the 1
long 1
tussoresilk 1
curtains 1
that 1
were 1
stretched 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
window 1
producing 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
momentary 1
japanese 1
effect 1
and 1
making 1
him 1
think 1
of 1
those 1
pallid 1
jadefaced 1
painters 1
of 1
tokyo 1
who 1
through 1
the 1
medium 1
of 1
an 1
art 1
that 1
is 1
necessarily 1
immobile 1
seek 1
to 1
convey 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
swiftness 1
and 1
motion 1
the 1
sullen 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
shouldering 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
long 1
unmown 1
grass 1
or 1
circling 1
with 1
monotonous 1
insistence 1
round 1
the 1
dusty 1
gilt 1
horns 1
of 1
the 1
straggling 1
woodbine 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
stillness 1
more 1
oppressive 1
the 1
dim 1
roar 1
of 1
london 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
bourdon 1
note 1
of 1
a 1
distant 1
organ 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
clamped 1
to 1
an 1
upright 1
easel 1
stood 1
the 1
fulllength 1
portrait 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
personal 1
beauty 1
and 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
some 1
little 1
distance 1
away 1
was 1
sitting 1
the 1
artist 1
himself 1
basil 1
hallward 1
whose 1
sudden 1
disappearance 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
caused 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
such 1
public 1
excitement 1
and 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
strange 1
conjectures 1
as 1
the 1
painter 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
gracious 1
and 1
comely 1
form 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
skilfully 1
mirrored 1
in 1
his 1
art 1
a 1
smile 1
of 1
pleasure 1
passed 1
across 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
seemed 1
about 1
to 1
linger 1
there 1
but 1
he 1
suddenly 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
closing 1
his 1
eyes 1
placed 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
the 1
lids 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
sought 1
to 1
imprison 1
within 1
his 1
brain 1
some 1
curious 1
dream 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
feared 1
he 1
might 1
awake 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
best 1
work 1
basil 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
languidly 1
you 1
must 1
certainly 1
send 1
it 1
next 1
year 1
to 1
the 1
grosvenor 1
the 1
academy 1
is 1
too 1
large 1
and 1
too 1
vulgar 1
whenever 1
i 1
have 1
gone 1
there 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
either 1
so 1
many 1
people 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
pictures 1
which 1
was 1
dreadful 1
or 1
so 1
many 1
pictures 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
people 1
which 1
was 1
worse 1
the 1
grosvenor 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
only 1
place 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
shall 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
he 1
answered 1
tossing 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
in 1
that 1
odd 1
way 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
friends 1
laugh 1
at 1
him 1
at 1
oxford 1
no 1
i 1
wont 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
lord 1
henry 1
elevated 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
amazement 1
through 1
the 1
thin 1
blue 1
wreaths 1
of 1
smoke 1
that 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
such 1
fanciful 1
whorls 1
from 1
his 1
heavy 1
opiumtainted 1
cigarette 1
not 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
reason 1
what 1
odd 1
chaps 1
you 1
painters 1
are 1
you 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
one 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
throw 1
it 1
away 1
it 1
is 1
silly 1
of 1
you 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
worse 1
than 1
being 1
talked 1
about 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
being 1
talked 1
about 1
a 1
portrait 1
like 1
this 1
would 1
set 1
you 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
england 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
old 1
men 1
quite 1
jealous 1
if 1
old 1
men 1
are 1
ever 1
capable 1
of 1
any 1
emotion 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
i 1
really 1
cant 1
exhibit 1
it 1
i 1
have 1
put 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
into 1
it 1
lord 1
henry 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
and 1
laughed 1
yes 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
would 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
it 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
basil 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
you 1
were 1
so 1
vain 1
and 1
i 1
really 1
cant 1
see 1
any 1
resemblance 1
between 1
you 1
with 1
your 1
rugged 1
strong 1
face 1
and 1
your 1
coalblack 1
hair 1
and 1
this 1
young 1
adonis 1
who 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
ivory 1
and 1
roseleaves 1
why 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
narcissus 1
and 1
youwell 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
intellectual 1
expression 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
but 1
beauty 1
real 1
beauty 1
ends 1
where 1
an 1
intellectual 1
expression 1
begins 1
intellect 1
is 1
in 1
itself 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
exaggeration 1
and 1
destroys 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
any 1
face 1
the 1
moment 1
one 1
sits 1
down 1
to 1
think 1
one 1
becomes 1
all 1
nose 1
or 1
all 1
forehead 1
or 1
something 1
horrid 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
successful 1
men 1
in 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
learned 1
professions 1
how 1
perfectly 1
hideous 1
they 1
are 1
except 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
but 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
they 1
dont 1
think 1
a 1
bishop 1
keeps 1
on 1
saying 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
eighty 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
natural 1
consequence 1
he 1
always 1
looks 1
absolutely 1
delightful 1
your 1
mysterious 1
young 1
friend 1
whose 1
name 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
but 1
whose 1
picture 1
really 1
fascinates 1
me 1
never 1
thinks 1
i 1
feel 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
some 1
brainless 1
beautiful 1
creature 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
always 1
here 1
in 1
winter 1
when 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
flowers 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
always 1
here 1
in 1
summer 1
when 1
we 1
want 1
something 1
to 1
chill 1
our 1
intelligence 1
dont 1
flatter 1
yourself 1
basil 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
like 1
him 1
you 1
dont 1
understand 1
me 1
harry 1
answered 1
the 1
artist 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
like 1
him 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
perfectly 1
well 1
indeed 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
him 1
you 1
shrug 1
your 1
shoulders 1
i 1
am 1
telling 1
you 1
the 1
truth 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
fatality 1
about 1
all 1
physical 1
and 1
intellectual 1
distinction 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
fatality 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
dog 1
through 1
history 1
the 1
faltering 1
steps 1
of 1
kings 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
different 1
from 1
ones 1

ugly 1
and 1
the 1
stupid 1

the 1
best 1
of 1

in 1
this 1
world 1
they 1
can 1
sit 1
at 1
their 1
ease 1
and 1
gape 1
at 1
the 1
play 1
if 1
they 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
victory 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
least 1
spared 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
defeat 1
they 1
live 1
as 1
we 1
all 1
should 1

without 1

the 1
gods 1
have 1
given 1
us 1
suffer 1
terribly 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
that 1
his 1
name 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
walking 1
across 1
the 1
studio 1
towards 1
basil 1
hallward 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
i 1
didnt 1
intend 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
why 1
not 1
oh 1
i 1
cant 1
explain 1
when 1
i 1
like 1
people 1
immensely 1
i 1
never 1
tell 1
their 1
names 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
it 1
is 1
like 1
surrendering 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
them 1
i 1
have 1
grown 1
to 1
love 1
secrecy 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
that 1
can 1
make 1
modern 1
life 1
mysterious 1
or 1
marvellous 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
commonest 1
thing 1
is 1
delightful 1
if 1
one 1
only 1
hides 1
it 1
when 1
i 1
leave 1
town 1
now 1
i 1
never 1
tell 1
my 1
people 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
i 1
would 1
lose 1
all 1
my 1
pleasure 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
silly 1
habit 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
but 1
somehow 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
bring 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
romance 1
into 1
ones 1
life 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
think 1
me 1
awfully 1
foolish 1
about 1
it 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
married 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
charm 1
of 1
marriage 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
makes 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
deception 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
for 1
both 1
parties 1
i 1
never 1
know 1
where 1
my 1
wife 1
is 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
never 1
knows 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
doing 1
when 1
we 1
meetwe 1
do 1
meet 1
occasionally 1
when 1
we 1
dine 1
out 1
together 1
or 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
dukeswe 1
tell 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
most 1
absurd 1
stories 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
faces 1
my 1
wife 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
at 1
itmuch 1
better 1
in 1
fact 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
she 1
never 1
gets 1
confused 1
over 1
her 1
dates 1
and 1
i 1
always 1
do 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
does 1
find 1
me 1
out 1
she 1
makes 1
no 1
row 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
sometimes 1
wish 1
she 1
would 1
but 1
she 1
merely 1
laughs 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
hate 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
talk 1
about 1
your 1
married 1
life 1
harry 1
said 1
basil 1
hallward 1
strolling 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
husband 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
thoroughly 1
ashamed 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
virtues 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
fellow 1
you 1
never 1
say 1
a 1
moral 1
thing 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
do 1
a 1
wrong 1
thing 1
your 1
cynicism 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
pose 1
being 1
natural 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
pose 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
irritating 1
pose 1
i 1
know 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
together 1
and 1
ensconced 1
themselves 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
bamboo 1
seat 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
a 1
tall 1
laurel 1
bush 1
the 1
sunlight 1
slipped 1
over 1
the 1
polished 1
leaves 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
white 1
daisies 1
were 1
tremulous 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
lord 1
henry 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
watch 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
going 1
basil 1
he 1
murmured 1
and 1
before 1
i 1
go 1
i 1
insist 1
on 1
your 1
answering 1
a 1
question 1
i 1
put 1
to 1
you 1
some 1
time 1
ago 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
keeping 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
you 1
know 1
quite 1
well 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
harry 1
well 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
me 1
why 1
you 1
wont 1
exhibit 1
dorian 1
grays 1
picture 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
no 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
it 1
now 1
that 1
is 1
childish 1
harry 1
said 1
basil 1
hallward 1
looking 1
him 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
every 1
portrait 1
that 1
is 1
painted 1
with 1
feeling 1
is 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
the 1
artist 1
not 1
of 1
the 1
sitter 1
the 1
sitter 1
is 1
merely 1
the 1
accident 1
the 1
occasion 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
he 1
who 1
is 1
revealed 1
by 1
the 1
painter 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
coloured 1
canvas 1
reveals 1
himself 1
the 1
reason 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
exhibit 1
this 1
picture 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
shown 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
soul 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughed 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
asked 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
hallward 1
but 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
perplexity 1
came 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
i 1
am 1
all 1
expectation 1
basil 1
continued 1
his 1
companion 1
glancing 1
at 1
him 1
oh 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
tell 1
harry 1
answered 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
will 1
hardly 1
understand 1
it 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
hardly 1
believe 1
it 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiled 1
and 1
leaning 1
down 1
plucked 1
a 1
pinkpetalled 1
daisy 1
from 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
i 1
shall 1
understand 1
it 1
he 1
replied 1
gazing 1
intently 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
golden 1
whitefeathered 1
disk 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
believing 1
things 1
i 1
can 1
believe 1
anything 1
provided 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
incredible 1
the 1
wind 1
shook 1
some 1
blossoms 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
heavy 1
lilacblooms 1
with 1
their 1
clustering 1
stars 1
moved 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
in 1
the 1
languid 1
air 1
a 1
grasshopper 1
began 1
to 1
chirrup 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
blue 1
thread 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
dragonfly 1
floated 1
past 1
on 1
its 1
brown 1
gauze 1
wings 1
lord 1
henry 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
heart 1
beating 1
and 1
wondered 1
what 1
was 1
coming 1
the 1
story 1
is 1
simply 1
this 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
crush 1
at 1
lady 1
brandons 1
you 1
know 1
we 1
poor 1
artists 1
have 1
to 1
show 1
ourselves 1
in 1
society 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
just 1
to 1
remind 1
the 1
public 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
savages 1
with 1
an 1
evening 1
coat 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
tie 1
as 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
anybody 1
even 1
a 1
stockbroker 1
can 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
for 1
being 1
civilized 1
well 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
talking 1
to 1
huge 1
overdressed 1
dowagers 1
and 1
tedious 1
academicians 1
i 1
suddenly 1
became 1
conscious 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
turned 1
halfway 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
dorian 1
gray 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
when 1
our 1
eyes 1
met 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
growing 1
pale 1
a 1
curious 1
sensation 1
of 1
terror 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
some 1
one 1
whose 1
mere 1
personality 1
was 1
so 1
fascinating 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
absorb 1
my 1
whole 1
nature 1
my 1
whole 1
soul 1
my 1
very 1
art 1
itself 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
any 1
external 1
influence 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
you 1
know 1
yourself 1
harry 1
how 1
independent 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
nature 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
had 1
at 1
least 1
always 1
been 1
so 1
till 1
i 1
met 1
dorian 1
gray 1
thenbut 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
explain 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
a 1
terrible 1
crisis 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
feeling 1
that 1
fate 1
had 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
exquisite 1
joys 1
and 1
exquisite 1
sorrows 1
i 1
grew 1
afraid 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
conscience 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
do 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
cowardice 1
i 1
take 1
no 1
credit 1
to 1
myself 1
for 1
trying 1
to 1
escape 1
conscience 1
and 1
cowardice 1
are 1
really 1
the 1
same 1
things 1
basil 1
conscience 1
is 1
the 1
tradename 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
that 1
harry 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
you 1
do 1
either 1
however 1
whatever 1
was 1
my 1
motiveand 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
pride 1
for 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
proudi 1
certainly 1
struggled 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
stumbled 1
against 1
lady 1
brandon 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
so 1
soon 1
mr 1
hallward 1
she 1
screamed 1
out 1
you 1
know 1
her 1
curiously 1
shrill 1
voice 1
yes 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
peacock 1
in 1
everything 1
but 1
beauty 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
pulling 1
the 1
daisy 1
to 1
bits 1
with 1
his 1
long 1
nervous 1
fingers 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
royalties 1
and 1
people 1
with 1
stars 1
and 1
garters 1
and 1
elderly 1
ladies 1
with 1
gigantic 1
tiaras 1
and 1
parrot 1
noses 1
she 1
spoke 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
dearest 1
friend 1
i 1
had 1
only 1
met 1
her 1
once 1
before 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
lionize 1
me 1
i 1
believe 1
some 1
picture 1
of 1
mine 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
least 1
had 1
been 1
chattered 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
penny 1
newspapers 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
nineteenthcentury 1
standard 1
of 1
immortality 1
suddenly 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
whose 1
personality 1
had 1
so 1
strangely 1
stirred 1
me 1
we 1
were 1
quite 1
close 1
almost 1
touching 1
our 1
eyes 1
met 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
reckless 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
asked 1
lady 1
brandon 1
to 1
introduce 1
me 1
to 1
him 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
reckless 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
inevitable 1
we 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
without 1
any 1
introduction 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
dorian 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
afterwards 1
he 1
too 1
felt 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
destined 1
to 1
know 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
lady 1
brandon 1
describe 1
this 1
wonderful 1
young 1
man 1
asked 1
his 1
companion 1
i 1
know 1
she 1
goes 1
in 1
for 1
giving 1
a 1
rapid 1
_precis_ 1
of 1
all 1
her 1
guests 1
i 1
remember 1
her 1
bringing 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
truculent 1
and 1
redfaced 1
old 1
gentleman 1
covered 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
orders 1
and 1
ribbons 1
and 1
hissing 1
into 1
my 1
ear 1
in 1
a 1
tragic 1
whisper 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
perfectly 1
audible 1
to 1
everybody 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
most 1
astounding 1
details 1
i 1
simply 1
fled 1
i 1
like 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
people 1
for 1
myself 1
but 1
lady 1
brandon 1
treats 1
her 1
guests 1
exactly 1
as 1
an 1
auctioneer 1
treats 1
his 1
goods 1
she 1
either 1
explains 1
them 1
entirely 1
away 1
or 1
tells 1
one 1
everything 1
about 1
them 1
except 1
what 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
know 1
poor 1
lady 1
brandon 1
you 1
are 1
hard 1
on 1
her 1
harry 1
said 1
hallward 1
listlessly 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
found 1
a 1
_salon_ 1
and 1
only 1
succeeded 1
in 1
opening 1
a 1
restaurant 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
admire 1
her 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
about 1
mr 1
dorian 1
gray 1
oh 1
something 1
like 1
charming 1
boypoor 1
dear 1
mother 1
and 1
i 1
absolutely 1
inseparable 1
quite 1
forget 1
what 1
he 1
doesafraid 1
hedoesnt 1
do 1
anythingoh 1
yes 1
plays 1
the 1
pianoor 1
is 1
it 1
the 1
violin 1
dear 1
mr 1
gray 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
help 1
laughing 1
and 1
we 1
became 1
friends 1
at 1
once 1
laughter 1
is 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
beginning 1
for 1
a 1
friendship 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
far 1
the 1
best 1
ending 1
for 1
one 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
plucking 1
another 1
daisy 1
hallward 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
you 1
dont 1
understand 1
what 1
friendship 1
is 1
harry 1
he 1
murmuredor 1
what 1
enmity 1
is 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
you 1
like 1
every 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
are 1
indifferent 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
how 1
horribly 1
unjust 1
of 1
you 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
tilting 1
his 1
hat 1
back 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
clouds 1
that 1
like 1
ravelled 1
skeins 1
of 1
glossy 1
white 1

turquoise 1
of 1
the 1

yes 1
horribly 1
unjust 1
of 1
you 1
i 1

a 1
great 1
difference 1

my 1
friends 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
looks 1
my 1
acquaintances 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
characters 1
and 1
my 1
enemies 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
intellects 1
a 1
man 1
cannot 1
be 1
too 1
careful 1
in 1
the 1
choice 1
of 1
his 1
enemies 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
a 1
fool 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
men 1
of 1
some 1
intellectual 1
power 1
and 1
consequently 1
they 1
all 1
appreciate 1
me 1
is 1
that 1
very 1
vain 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
vain 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
harry 1
but 1
according 1
to 1
your 1
category 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
merely 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
my 1
dear 1
old 1
basil 1
you 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
and 1
much 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
friend 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
brother 1
i 1
suppose 1
oh 1
brothers 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
for 1
brothers 1
my 1
elder 1
brother 1
wont 1
die 1
and 1
my 1
younger 1
brothers 1
seem 1
never 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
else 1
harry 1
exclaimed 1
hallward 1
frowning 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
serious 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
detesting 1
my 1
relations 1
i 1
suppose 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
stand 1
other 1
people 1
having 1
the 1
same 1
faults 1
as 1
ourselves 1
i 1
quite 1
sympathize 1
with 1
the 1
rage 1
of 1
the 1
english 1
democracy 1
against 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
the 1
vices 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
orders 1
the 1
masses 1
feel 1
that 1
drunkenness 1
stupidity 1
and 1
immorality 1
should 1
be 1
their 1
own 1
special 1
property 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
makes 1
an 1
ass 1
of 1
himself 1
he 1
is 1
poaching 1
on 1
their 1
preserves 1
when 1
poor 1
southwark 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
divorce 1
court 1
their 1
indignation 1
was 1
quite 1
magnificent 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
dont 1
suppose 1
that 1
ten 1
per 1
cent 1
of 1
the 1
proletariat 1
live 1
correctly 1
i 1
dont 1
agree 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
more 1
harry 1
i 1
feel 1
sure 1
you 1
dont 1
either 1

his 1

how 1
english 1
you 1
are 1
basil 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
that 1
observation 1
if 1
one 1
puts 1
forward 1
an 1
idea 1
to 1
a 1
true 1
englishmanalways 1
a 1
rash 1
thing 1
to 1
dohe 1
never 1
dreams 1
of 1
considering 1
whether 1
the 1
idea 1
is 1
right 1
or 1
wrong 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
he 1
considers 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
is 1
whether 1
one 1
believes 1
it 1
oneself 1
now 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
an 1
idea 1
has 1
nothing 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
sincerity 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
expresses 1
it 1
indeed 1
the 1
probabilities 1
are 1
that 1
the 1
more 1
insincere 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
purely 1
intellectual 1
will 1
the 1
idea 1
be 1
as 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
coloured 1
by 1
either 1
his 1
wants 1
his 1
desires 1
or 1
his 1
prejudices 1
however 1
i 1
dont 1
propose 1
to 1
discuss 1
politics 1
sociology 1
or 1
metaphysics 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
like 1
persons 1
better 1
than 1
principles 1
and 1
i 1
like 1
persons 1
with 1
no 1
principles 1
better 1
than 1
anything 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
tell 1
me 1
more 1
about 1
mr 1
dorian 1
gray 1
how 1
often 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
every 1
day 1
i 1
couldnt 1
be 1
happy 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
see 1
him 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
is 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
to 1
me 1
how 1
extraordinary 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
care 1
for 1
anything 1
but 1
your 1
art 1
he 1
is 1
all 1
my 1
art 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
gravely 1
i 1
sometimes 1
think 1
harry 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
eras 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
in 1
the 1
worlds 1
history 1
the 1
first 1
is 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
medium 1
for 1
art 1
and 1
the 1
second 1
is 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
personality 1
for 1
art 1
also 1
what 1
the 1
invention 1
of 1
oilpainting 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
venetians 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
antinous 1
was 1
to 1
late 1
greek 1
sculpture 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
merely 1
that 1
i 1
paint 1
from 1
him 1
draw 1
from 1
him 1
sketch 1
from 1
him 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
all 1
that 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
much 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
a 1
model 1
or 1
a 1
sitter 1
i 1
wont 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
of 1
him 1
or 1
that 1
his 1
beauty 1
is 1
such 1
that 1
art 1
cannot 1
express 1
it 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
that 1
art 1
cannot 1
express 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
work 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
since 1
i 1
met 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
good 1
work 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
but 1
in 1
some 1
curious 1
wayi 1
wonder 1
will 1
you 1
understand 1
mehis 1
personality 1
has 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
manner 1
in 1
art 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
mode 1
of 1
style 1
i 1
see 1
things 1
differently 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
differently 1
i 1
can 1
now 1
recreate 1
life 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
was 1
hidden 1
from 1
me 1
before 1
a 1
dream 1
of 1
form 1
in 1
days 1
of 1
thoughtwho 1
is 1
it 1
who 1
says 1
that 1
i 1
forget 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
what 1
dorian 1
gray 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
merely 1
visible 1
presence 1
of 1
this 1
ladfor 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
lad 1
though 1
he 1
is 1
really 1
over 1
twentyhis 1
merely 1
visible 1
presenceah 1
i 1
wonder 1
can 1
you 1
realize 1
all 1
that 1
that 1
means 1
unconsciously 1
he 1
defines 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
a 1
fresh 1
school 1
a 1
school 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
the 1
romantic 1
spirit 1
all 1
the 1
perfection 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
that 1
is 1
greek 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
soul 1
and 1
bodyhow 1
much 1
that 1
is 1
we 1
in 1
our 1
madness 1
have 1
separated 1
the 1
two 1
and 1
have 1
invented 1
a 1
realism 1
that 1
is 1
vulgar 1
an 1
ideality 1
that 1
is 1
void 1
harry 1
if 1
you 1
only 1
knew 1
what 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
remember 1
that 1
landscape 1
of 1
mine 1
for 1
which 1
agnew 1
offered 1
me 1
such 1
a 1
huge 1
price 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
part 1
with 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
things 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
and 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
because 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
painting 1
it 1
dorian 1
gray 1
sat 1
beside 1
me 1
some 1
subtle 1
influence 1
passed 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
plain 1
woodland 1
the 1
wonder 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
for 1
and 1
always 1
missed 1
basil 1
this 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
dorian 1
gray 1
hallward 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
seat 1
and 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
garden 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
harry 1
he 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
to 1
me 1
simply 1
a 1
motive 1
in 1
art 1
you 1
might 1
see 1
nothing 1
in 1
him 1
i 1
see 1
everything 1
in 1
him 1
he 1
is 1
never 1
more 1
present 1
in 1
my 1
work 1
than 1
when 1
no 1
image 1
of 1
him 1
is 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
suggestion 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
manner 1
i 1
find 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
certain 1
lines 1
in 1
the 1
loveliness 1
and 1
subtleties 1
of 1
certain 1
colours 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
then 1
why 1
wont 1
you 1
exhibit 1
his 1
portrait 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
because 1
without 1
intending 1
it 1
i 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
it 1
some 1
expression 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
curious 1
artistic 1
idolatry 1
of 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
cared 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
knows 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
shall 1
never 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
world 1
might 1
guess 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
bare 1
my 1
soul 1
to 1
their 1
shallow 1
prying 1
eyes 1
my 1
heart 1
shall 1
never 1
be 1
put 1
under 1
their 1
microscope 1
there 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
thing 1
harrytoo 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
poets 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
scrupulous 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
they 1
know 1
how 1
useful 1
passion 1
is 1
for 1
publication 1
nowadays 1
a 1
broken 1
heart 1
will 1
run 1
to 1
many 1
editions 1
i 1
hate 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
cried 1
hallward 1
an 1
artist 1
should 1
create 1
beautiful 1
things 1
but 1
should 1
put 1
nothing 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
into 1
them 1
we 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
when 1
men 1
treat 1
art 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
autobiography 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
abstract 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
some 1
day 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
the 1
world 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
the 1
world 1
shall 1
never 1
see 1
my 1
portrait 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
are 1
wrong 1
basil 1
but 1
i 1
wont 1
argue 1
with 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
intellectually 1
lost 1
who 1
ever 1
argue 1
tell 1
me 1
is 1
dorian 1
gray 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
you 1
the 1
painter 1
considered 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
likes 1
me 1
he 1
answered 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
likes 1
me 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
flatter 1
him 1
dreadfully 1
i 1
find 1
a 1
strange 1
pleasure 1
in 1
saying 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
having 1
said 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
he 1
is 1
charming 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
we 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
studio 1
and 1
talk 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
however 1
he 1
is 1
horribly 1
thoughtless 1
and 1
seems 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
real 1
delight 1
in 1
giving 1
me 1
pain 1
then 1
i 1
feel 1
harry 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
away 1
my 1
whole 1
soul 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
treats 1
it 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
flower 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
decoration 1
to 1
charm 1
his 1
vanity 1
an 1
ornament 1
for 1
a 1
summers 1
day 1
days 1
in 1
summer 1
basil 1
are 1
apt 1
to 1
linger 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
tire 1
sooner 1
than 1
he 1
will 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sad 1
thing 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
genius 1
lasts 1
longer 1
than 1
beauty 1
that 1
accounts 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
take 1
such 1
pains 1
to 1
overeducate 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
wild 1
struggle 1
for 1
existence 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
that 1
endures 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
fill 1
our 1
minds 1
with 1
rubbish 1
and 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
silly 1
hope 1
of 1
keeping 1
our 1
place 1
the 1
thoroughly 1
wellinformed 1
manthat 1
is 1
the 1
modern 1
ideal 1
and 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
thoroughly 1
wellinformed 1
man 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
_bricabrac_ 1
shop 1
all 1
monsters 1
and 1
dust 1
with 1
everything 1
priced 1
above 1
its 1
proper 1
value 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
tire 1
first 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
some 1
day 1
you 1
will 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
friend 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
out 1
of 1
drawing 1
or 1
you 1
wont 1
like 1
his 1
tone 1
of 1
colour 1
or 1
something 1
you 1
will 1
bitterly 1
reproach 1
him 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
heart 1
and 1
seriously 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
behaved 1
very 1
badly 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
calls 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
perfectly 1
cold 1
and 1
indifferent 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
pity 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
alter 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
romance 1
a 1
romance 1
of 1
art 1
one 1
might 1
call 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
romance 1

trivial 1
side 1

lord 1
henry 1
struck 1
a 1
light 1
on 1
a 1
dainty 1
silver 1
case 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
smoke 1
a 1
cigarette 1
with 1
a 1
selfconscious 1
and 1
satisfied 1
air 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
summed 1
up 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
a 1
phrase 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rustle 1
of 1
chirruping 1
sparrows 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
lacquer 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
ivy 1
and 1
the 1
blue 1
cloudshadows 1
chased 1
themselves 1
across 1
the 1
grass 1
like 1
swallows 1
how 1
pleasant 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
how 1
delightful 1
other 1
peoples 1
emotions 1
weremuch 1
more 1
delightful 1
than 1
their 1
ideas 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
ones 1
own 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
ones 1
friendsthose 1
were 1
the 1
fascinating 1
things 1
in 1
life 1
he 1
pictured 1
to 1
himself 1
with 1
silent 1
amusement 1
the 1
tedious 1
luncheon 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
missed 1
by 1
staying 1
so 1
long 1
with 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
he 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
aunts 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
sure 1
to 1
have 1
met 1
lord 1
goodbody 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
conversation 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
about 1
the 1
feeding 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
and 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
model 1
lodginghouses 1
each 1
class 1
would 1
have 1
preached 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
those 1
virtues 1
for 1
whose 1
exercise 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
necessity 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
lives 1
the 1
rich 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
on 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
thrift 1
and 1
the 1
idle 1
grown 1
eloquent 1
over 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
labour 1
it 1
was 1
charming 1
to 1
have 1
escaped 1
all 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
an 1
idea 1
seemed 1
to 1
strike 1
him 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
hallward 1
and 1
said 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
remembered 1
remembered 1
what 1
harry 1
where 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
where 1
was 1
it 1
asked 1
hallward 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
frown 1
dont 1
look 1
so 1
angry 1
basil 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
aunt 1
lady 1
agathas 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
wonderful 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
end 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
dorian 1
gray 1
i 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
goodlooking 1
women 1
have 1
no 1
appreciation 1
of 1
good 1
looks 1
at 1
least 1
good 1
women 1
have 1
not 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
beautiful 1
nature 1
i 1
at 1
once 1
pictured 1
to 1
myself 1
a 1
creature 1
with 1
spectacles 1
and 1
lank 1
hair 1
horribly 1
freckled 1
and 1
tramping 1
about 1
on 1
huge 1
feet 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
friend 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
glad 1
you 1
didnt 1
harry 1
why 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
you 1
dont 1
want 1

to 1
meet 1
him 1
no 1
mr 1
dorian 1
gray 1

in 1
the 1
studio 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
butler 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
you 1
must 1
introduce 1
me 1
now 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
the 1
painter 1
turned 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
who 1
stood 1
blinking 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
ask 1
mr 1
gray 1
to 1
wait 1
parker 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
the 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
the 1
walk 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
my 1
dearest 1
friend 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
simple 1
and 1
a 1
beautiful 1
nature 1
your 1
aunt 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
what 1
she 1
said 1
of 1
him 1
dont 1
spoil 1
him 1
dont 1
try 1
to 1
influence 1
him 1
your 1
influence 1
would 1
be 1
bad 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
wide 1
and 1
has 1
many 1
marvellous 1
people 1
in 1
it 1
dont 1
take 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
one 1
person 1
who 1
gives 1
to 1
my 1
art 1
whatever 1
charm 1
it 1
possesses 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
an 1
artist 1
depends 1
on 1
him 1
mind 1
harry 1
i 1
trust 1
you 1
he 1
spoke 1
very 1
slowly 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
seemed 1
wrung 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
almost 1
against 1
his 1
will 1
what 1
nonsense 1
you 1
talk 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiling 1
and 1
taking 1
hallward 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
he 1
almost 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
chapter 1
2 1
as 1
they 1
entered 1
they 1
saw 1
dorian 1
gray 1
he 1
was 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
piano 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
them 1
turning 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
schumanns 1
forest 1
scenes 1
you 1
must 1
lend 1
me 1
these 1
basil 1
he 1
cried 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
learn 1
them 1
they 1
are 1
perfectly 1
charming 1
that 1
entirely 1
depends 1
on 1
how 1
you 1
sit 1
today 1
dorian 1
oh 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
sitting 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
a 1
lifesized 1
portrait 1
of 1
myself 1
answered 1
the 1
lad 1
swinging 1
round 1
on 1
the 1
musicstool 1
in 1
a 1
wilful 1
petulant 1
manner 1
when 1
he 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
lord 1
henry 1
a 1
faint 1
blush 1
coloured 1
his 1
cheeks 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
started 1
up 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
basil 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
you 1
had 1
any 1
one 1
with 1
you 1
this 1
is 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
dorian 1
an 1
old 1
oxford 1
friend 1
of 1
mine 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
telling 1
him 1
what 1
a 1
capital 1
sitter 1
you 1
were 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
spoiled 1
everything 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
spoiled 1
my 1
pleasure 1
in 1
meeting 1
you 1
mr 1
gray 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
stepping 1
forward 1
and 1
extending 1
his 1
hand 1
my 1
aunt 1
has 1
often 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
favourites 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
victims 1
also 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
lady 1
agathas 1
black 1
books 1
at 1
present 1
answered 1
dorian 1
with 1
a 1
funny 1
look 1
of 1
penitence 1
i 1
promised 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
club 1
in 1
whitechapel 1
with 1
her 1
last 1
tuesday 1
and 1
i 1
really 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
played 1
a 1
duet 1
togetherthree 1
duets 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
she 1
will 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
far 1
too 1
frightened 1
to 1
call 1
oh 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
your 1
peace 1
with 1
my 1
aunt 1
she 1
is 1
quite 1
devoted 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
it 1
really 1
matters 1
about 1
your 1
not 1
being 1
there 1
the 1
audience 1
probably 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
duet 1
when 1
aunt 1
agatha 1
sits 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
piano 1
she 1
makes 1
quite 1
enough 1
noise 1
for 1
two 1
people 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
horrid 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
very 1
nice 1
to 1
me 1
answered 1
dorian 1
laughing 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
yes 1
he 1
was 1
certainly 1
wonderfully 1
handsome 1
with 1
his 1
finely 1
curved 1
scarlet 1
lips 1
his 1
frank 1
blue 1
eyes 1
his 1
crisp 1
gold 1
hair 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
that 1
made 1
one 1
trust 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
all 1
the 1
candour 1
of 1
youth 1
was 1
there 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
all 1
youths 1
passionate 1
purity 1
one 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
kept 1
himself 1
unspotted 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
no 1
wonder 1
basil 1
hallward 1
worshipped 1
him 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
charming 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
philanthropy 1
mr 1
grayfar 1
too 1
charming 1
and 1
lord 1
henry 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
cigarettecase 1
the 1
painter 1
had 1
been 1
busy 1
mixing 1
his 1
colours 1
and 1
getting 1
his 1
brushes 1
ready 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
worried 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
lord 1
henrys 1
last 1
remark 1
he 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
harry 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
finish 1
this 1
picture 1
today 1
would 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
awfully 1
rude 1
of 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiled 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
go 1
mr 1
gray 1
he 1
asked 1
oh 1
please 1
dont 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
basil 1
is 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
sulky 1
moods 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
sulks 1
besides 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
philanthropy 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
mr 1
gray 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
tedious 1
a 1
subject 1
that 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
talk 1
seriously 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
certainly 1
shall 1
not 1
run 1
away 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
stop 1
you 1
dont 1
really 1
mind 1
basil 1
do 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
often 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
liked 1
your 1
sitters 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
one 1
to 1
chat 1
to 1
hallward 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
if 1
dorian 1
wishes 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
must 1
stay 1
dorians 1
whims 1
are 1
laws 1
to 1
everybody 1
except 1
himself 1
lord 1
henry 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
gloves 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
pressing 1
basil 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
orleans 1
goodbye 1
mr 1
gray 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
some 1
afternoon 1
in 1
curzon 1
street 1
i 1
am 1
nearly 1
always 1
at 1
home 1
at 1
five 1
oclock 1
write 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
coming 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
miss 1
you 1
basil 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
if 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
goes 1
i 1
shall 1
go 1
too 1
you 1
never 1
open 1
your 1
lips 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
painting 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
horribly 1
dull 1
standing 1
on 1
a 1
platform 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
look 1
pleasant 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
i 1
insist 1
upon 1
it 1
stay 1
harry 1
to 1
oblige 1
dorian 1
and 1
to 1
oblige 1
me 1
said 1
hallward 1
gazing 1
intently 1
at 1
his 1
picture 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
i 1
never 1
talk 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
working 1
and 1
never 1
listen 1
either 1
and 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
dreadfully 1
tedious 1
for 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
sitters 1
i 1
beg 1
you 1
to 1
stay 1
but 1
what 1
about 1
my 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
orleans 1
the 1
painter 1
laughed 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
any 1
difficulty 1
about 1
that 1
sit 1
down 1
again 1
harry 1
and 1
now 1
dorian 1
get 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
dont 1
move 1
about 1
too 1
much 1
or 1
pay 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
what 1
lord 1
henry 1
says 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
influence 1
over 1
all 1
his 1
friends 1
with 1
the 1
single 1
exception 1
of 1
myself 1
dorian 1
gray 1
stepped 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
dais 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
greek 1
martyr 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
_moue_ 1
of 1
discontent 1
to 1
lord 1
henry 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
rather 1
taken 1
a 1
fancy 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
unlike 1
basil 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
delightful 1
contrast 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
voice 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
have 1
you 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
influence 1
lord 1
henry 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
basil 1
says 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
influence 1
mr 1
gray 1
all 1
influence 1
is 1
immoralimmoral 1
from 1
the 1
scientific 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
why 1
because 1
to 1
influence 1
a 1
person 1
is 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
ones 1
own 1
soul 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
think 1
his 1
natural 1
thoughts 1
or 1
burn 1
with 1
his 1
natural 1
passions 1
his 1
virtues 1
are 1
not 1
real 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
sins 1
if 1
there 1
are 1
such 1
things 1
as 1
sins 1
are 1
borrowed 1
he 1
becomes 1
an 1
echo 1
of 1
some 1

that 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
written 1
for 1
him 1
the 1
aim 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
selfdevelopment 1
to 1
realize 1
ones 1
nature 1
perfectlythat 1
is 1
what 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
here 1
for 1
people 1
are 1
afraid 1
of 1
themselves 1
nowadays 1
they 1
have 1
forgotten 1
the 1
highest 1
of 1
all 1
duties 1
the 1
duty 1
that 1
one 1
owes 1
to 1
ones 1
self 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
are 1
charitable 1
they 1
feed 1
the 1
hungry 1
and 1
clothe 1
the 1
beggar 1
but 1
their 1
own 1
souls 1
starve 1
and 1
are 1
naked 1
courage 1
has 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
race 1
perhaps 1
we 1
never 1
really 1
had 1
it 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
society 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
morals 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
god 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
religionthese 1
are 1
the 1
two 1
things 1
that 1
govern 1
us 1
and 1
yet 1
just 1
turn 1
your 1
head 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
dorian 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
deep 1
in 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
conscious 1
only 1
that 1
a 1
look 1
had 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
lads 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
there 1
before 1
and 1
yet 1
continued 1
lord 1
henry 1
in 1
his 1
low 1
musical 1
voice 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
graceful 1
wave 1
of 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
so 1
characteristic 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
even 1
in 1
his 1
eton 1
days 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
if 1
one 1
man 1
were 1
to 1
live 1
out 1
his 1
life 1
fully 1
and 1
completely 1
were 1
to 1
give 1
form 1
to 1
every 1
feeling 1
expression 1
to 1
every 1
thought 1
reality 1
to 1
every 1
dreami 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
gain 1
such 1
a 1
fresh 1
impulse 1
of 1
joy 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
forget 1
all 1
the 1
maladies 1
of 1
mediaevalism 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
hellenic 1
idealto 1
something 1
finer 1
richer 1
than 1
the 1
hellenic 1
ideal 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
but 1
the 1
bravest 1
man 1
amongst 1
us 1
is 1
afraid 1
of 1
himself 1
the 1
mutilation 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
has 1
its 1
tragic 1
survival 1
in 1
the 1
selfdenial 1
that 1
mars 1
our 1
lives 1
we 1
are 1
punished 1
for 1
our 1
refusals 1
every 1
impulse 1
that 1
we 1
strive 1
to 1
strangle 1
broods 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
and 1
poisons 1
us 1
the 1
body 1
sins 1
once 1
and 1
has 1
done 1
with 1
its 1
sin 1
for 1
action 1
is 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
purification 1
nothing 1
remains 1
then 1
but 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
a 1
pleasure 1
or 1
the 1
luxury 1
of 1
a 1
regret 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
a 1
temptation 1
is 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
it 1
resist 1
it 1
and 1
your 1
soul 1
grows 1
sick 1
with 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
things 1
it 1
has 1
forbidden 1
to 1
itself 1
with 1
desire 1
for 1
what 1
its 1
monstrous 1
laws 1
have 1
made 1
monstrous 1
and 1
unlawful 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
the 1
brain 1
only 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
take 1
place 1
also 1
you 1
mr 1
gray 1
you 1
yourself 1
with 1
your 1
rosered 1
youth 1
and 1
your 1
rosewhite 1
boyhood 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
passions 1
that 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
afraid 1
thoughts 1
that 1
have 1
filled 1
you 1
with 1
terror 1
daydreams 1
and 1
sleeping 1
dreams 1
whose 1
mere 1
memory 1
might 1
stain 1
your 1

with 1
shame 1

stop 1
you 1
bewilder 1
me 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
answer 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1

it 1

let 1
me 1

rather 1
let 1
me 1
try 1
not 1

nearly 1
ten 1
minutes 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
motionless 1
with 1
parted 1
lips 1
and 1
eyes 1
strangely 1
bright 1
he 1
was 1
dimly 1
conscious 1
that 1
entirely 1
fresh 1
influences 1
were 1
at 1
work 1
within 1
him 1
yet 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
really 1
from 1
himself 1
the 1
few 1
words 1
that 1
basils 1
friend 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
himwords 1
spoken 1
by 1
chance 1
no 1
doubt 1
and 1
with 1
wilful 1
paradox 1
in 1
themhad 1
touched 1
some 1
secret 1
chord 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
touched 1
before 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
was 1
now 1
vibrating 1
and 1
throbbing 1
to 1
curious 1
pulses 1
music 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
like 1
that 1
music 1
had 1
troubled 1
him 1
many 1
times 1
but 1
music 1
was 1
not 1
articulate 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
new 1
world 1
but 1
rather 1
another 1
chaos 1
that 1
it 1
created 1
in 1
us 1
words 1
mere 1
words 1
how 1
terrible 1
they 1
were 1
how 1
clear 1
and 1
vivid 1
and 1
cruel 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
escape 1
from 1
them 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
a 1
subtle 1
magic 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
them 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
plastic 1
form 1
to 1
formless 1
things 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
music 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
as 1
sweet 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
viol 1
or 1
of 1
lute 1
mere 1
words 1
was 1
there 1
anything 1
so 1
real 1
as 1
words 1
yes 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
things 1
in 1
his 1
boyhood 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
understood 1
he 1
understood 1
them 1
now 1
life 1
suddenly 1
became 1
fierycoloured 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
walking 1
in 1
fire 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
known 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
subtle 1
smile 1
lord 1
henry 1
watched 1
him 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
precise 1
psychological 1
moment 1
when 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
he 1
felt 1
intensely 1
interested 1
he 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
sudden 1
impression 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
had 1
produced 1
and 1
remembering 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
read 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sixteen 1
a 1
book 1
which 1
had 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
before 1
he 1
wondered 1
whether 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
passing 1
through 1
a 1
similar 1
experience 1
he 1
had 1
merely 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
had 1
it 1
hit 1
the 1
mark 1
how 1
fascinating 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
hallward 1
painted 1
away 1
with 1
that 1
marvellous 1
bold 1
touch 1
of 1
his 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
true 1
refinement 1
and 1
perfect 1
delicacy 1
that 1
in 1
art 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
comes 1
only 1
from 1
strength 1
he 1
was 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
silence 1
basil 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
standing 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
suddenly 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
air 1
is 1
stifling 1
here 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
painting 1
i 1
cant 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
else 1
but 1
you 1
never 1
sat 1
better 1
you 1
were 1
perfectly 1
still 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
caught 1
the 1
effect 1
i 1
wantedthe 1
halfparted 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
harry 1
has 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
certainly 1
made 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
expression 1
i 1
suppose 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
paying 1
you 1
compliments 1
you 1
mustnt 1
believe 1
a 1
word 1
that 1
he 1
says 1
he 1
has 1
certainly 1
not 1
been 1
paying 1
me 1
compliments 1
perhaps 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
that 1
i 1
dont 1
believe 1
anything 1
he 1
has 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
believe 1
it 1
all 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
dreamy 1
languorous 1
eyes 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
horribly 1
hot 1
in 1
the 1
studio 1
basil 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
something 1
iced 1
to 1
drink 1
something 1
with 1
strawberries 1
in 1
it 1
certainly 1
harry 1
just 1
touch 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
when 1
parker 1
comes 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
work 1
up 1
this 1
background 1
so 1
i 1
will 1
join 1
you 1
later 1
on 1
dont 1
keep 1
dorian 1
too 1
long 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
in 1
better 1
form 1
for 1
painting 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
today 1
this 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
masterpiece 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
masterpiece 1
as 1
it 1
stands 1
lord 1
henry 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
found 1
dorian 1
gray 1
burying 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
cool 1
lilacblossoms 1
feverishly 1
drinking 1
in 1
their 1
perfume 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
wine 1
he 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
he 1
murmured 1
nothing 1
can 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
but 1
the 1
senses 1
just 1
as 1
nothing 1
can 1
cure 1
the 1
senses 1
but 1
the 1
soul 1
the 1
lad 1
started 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
he 1
was 1
bareheaded 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
had 1
tossed 1
his 1
rebellious 1
curls 1
and 1
tangled 1
all 1
their 1
gilded 1
threads 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
fear 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
such 1
as 1
people 1
have 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
suddenly 1
awakened 1
his 1
finely 1
chiselled 1
nostrils 1
quivered 1
and 1
some 1
hidden 1
nerve 1
shook 1
the 1
scarlet 1
of 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
trembling 1
yes 1
continued 1
lord 1
henry 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
secrets 1
of 1
lifeto 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
wonderful 1
creation 1
you 1
know 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
know 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
dorian 1
gray 1
frowned 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
away 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
liking 1
the 1
tall 1
graceful 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
him 1
his 1
romantic 1
olivecoloured 1
face 1
and 1
worn 1
expression 1
interested 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
low 1
languid 1
voice 1
that 1
was 1
absolutely 1
fascinating 1
his 1
cool 1
white 1
flowerlike 1
hands 1
even 1
had 1
a 1
curious 1
charm 1
they 1
moved 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
like 1
music 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
language 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
ashamed 1
of 1
being 1
afraid 1
why 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
left 1
for 1
a 1
stranger 1
to 1
reveal 1
him 1
to 1
himself 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
basil 1
hallward 1
for 1
months 1
but 1
the 1
friendship 1
between 1
them 1
had 1
never 1
altered 1
him 1
suddenly 1
there 1
had 1
come 1
some 1
one 1
across 1
his 1
life 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
disclosed 1
to 1
him 1
lifes 1
mystery 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
schoolboy 1
or 1
a 1
girl 1
it 1
was 1
absurd 1
to 1
be 1
frightened 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
parker 1
has 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
drinks 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
stay 1
any 1
longer 1
in 1
this 1
glare 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
quite 1
spoiled 1
and 1
basil 1
will 1
never 1
paint 1
you 1
again 1
you 1
really 1
must 1
not 1
allow 1
yourself 1
to 1
become 1
sunburnt 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unbecoming 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
matter 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
seat 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
it 1
should 1
matter 1
everything 1
to 1
you 1
mr 1
gray 1
why 1
because 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
marvellous 1
youth 1
and 1
youth 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
no 1
you 1
dont 1
feel 1
it 1
now 1
some 1
day 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
old 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
ugly 1
when 1
thought 1
has 1
seared 1
your 1
forehead 1
with 1
its 1
lines 1
and 1
passion 1
branded 1
your 1
lips 1
with 1
its 1
hideous 1
fires 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
it 1
terribly 1
now 1
wherever 1
you 1
go 1
you 1
charm 1
the 1
world 1
will 1
it 1
always 1
be 1
so 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
wonderfully 1
beautiful 1
face 1
mr 1
gray 1
dont 1
frown 1
you 1
have 1
and 1
beauty 1
is 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
geniusis 1
higher 1
indeed 1
than 1
genius 1
as 1
it 1
needs 1
no 1
explanation 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
like 1
sunlight 1
or 1
springtime 1
or 1
the 1
reflection 1
in 1
dark 1
waters 1
of 1
that 1
silver 1
shell 1
we 1
call 1
the 1
moon 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
questioned 1
it 1
has 1
its 1

people 1

live 1
really 1
perfectly 1
and 1
fully 1
when 1
your 1
youth 1
goes 1
your 1
beauty 1
will 1
go 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
suddenly 1
discover 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
no 1

left 1
for 1
you 1

have 1

that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
your 1

make 1
more 1
bitter 1
than 1

it 1

you 1

something 1
dreadful 1

against 1
your 1

you 1

sallow 1

while 1
you 1
have 1
it 1
dont 1

failure 1
or 1
giving 1
away 1
your 1

to 1
the 1

the 1

are 1

live 1
the 1

that 1
is 1
in 1
you 1
let 1
nothing 1
be 1

be 1
always 1
searching 1
for 1
new 1

your 1

there 1
is 1
nothing 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
the 1
world 1
belongs 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
really 1
might 1
be 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
you 1
that 1
charmed 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
i 1
must 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
about 1
yourself 1
i 1
thought 1
how 1
tragic 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
wasted 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
that 1
your 1
youth 1
will 1
lastsuch 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
the 1
common 1
hillflowers 1
wither 1
but 1
they 1
blossom 1
again 1
the 1
laburnum 1
will 1
be 1
as 1
yellow 1
next 1
june 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
a 1
month 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
purple 1
stars 1
on 1
the 1
clematis 1
and 1
year 1
after 1
year 1
the 1
green 1
night 1
of 1
its 1
leaves 1
will 1
hold 1
its 1
purple 1
stars 1
but 1
we 1
never 1
get 1
back 1
our 1
youth 1
the 1
pulse 1
of 1
joy 1
that 1
beats 1
in 1
us 1
at 1
twenty 1
becomes 1
sluggish 1
our 1
limbs 1
fail 1
our 1
senses 1
rot 1
we 1
degenerate 1
into 1
hideous 1
puppets 1
haunted 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
too 1
much 1
afraid 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
temptations 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
youth 1
youth 1
there 1
is 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
youth 1
dorian 1
gray 1
listened 1
openeyed 1
and 1
wondering 1
the 1
spray 1
of 1
lilac 1
fell 1
from 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
gravel 1
a 1
furry 1
bee 1
came 1
and 1
buzzed 1
round 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
scramble 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
oval 1
stellated 1
globe 1
of 1
the 1
tiny 1
blossoms 1
he 1
watched 1
it 1
with 1
that 1
strange 1
interest 1
in 1
trivial 1
things 1
that 1
we 1
try 1
to 1
develop 1
when 1
things 1
of 1
high 1
import 1
make 1
us 1
afraid 1
or 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
stirred 1
by 1
some 1
new 1
emotion 1
for 1
which 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
expression 1
or 1
when 1
some 1
thought 1
that 1
terrifies 1
us 1
lays 1
sudden 1
siege 1
to 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
calls 1
on 1
us 1
to 1
yield 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
bee 1
flew 1
away 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
creeping 1
into 1
the 1
stained 1
trumpet 1
of 1
a 1
tyrian 1
convolvulus 1
the 1
flower 1
seemed 1
to 1
quiver 1
and 1
then 1
swayed 1
gently 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
suddenly 1
the 1
painter 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
studio 1
and 1
made 1
staccato 1
signs 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
they 1
turned 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
smiled 1
i 1
am 1
waiting 1
he 1
cried 1
do 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
is 1
quite 1
perfect 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
bring 1
your 1
drinks 1
they 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
sauntered 1
down 1
the 1
walk 1
together 1
two 1
greenandwhite 1
butterflies 1
fluttered 1
past 1
them 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
peartree 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
a 1
thrush 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1
you 1
are 1
glad 1
you 1
have 1
met 1
me 1
mr 1
gray 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
yes 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
now 1
i 1
wonder 1
shall 1
i 1
always 1
be 1
glad 1
always 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
word 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
women 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
using 1
it 1
they 1
spoil 1
every 1
romance 1
by 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
last 1
for 1
ever 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
meaningless 1
word 1
too 1
the 1
only 1
difference 1
between 1
a 1
caprice 1
and 1
a 1
lifelong 1
passion 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
caprice 1
lasts 1
a 1
little 1
longer 1
as 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
studio 1
dorian 1
gray 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
lord 1
henrys 1
arm 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
let 1
our 1
friendship 1
be 1
a 1
caprice 1
he 1
murmured 1
flushing 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
boldness 1
then 1
stepped 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
resumed 1
his 1
pose 1
lord 1
henry 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
large 1
wicker 1
armchair 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
the 1
sweep 1
and 1
dash 1
of 1
the 1
brush 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
made 1
the 1
only 1
sound 1
that 1
broke 1
the 1
stillness 1
except 1
when 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
hallward 1
stepped 1
back 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
work 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
in 1
the 1
slanting 1
beams 1
that 1
streamed 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
doorway 1
the 1
dust 1
danced 1
and 1
was 1
golden 1
the 1
heavy 1
scent 1
of 1
the 1
roses 1
seemed 1
to 1
brood 1
over 1
everything 1
after 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
hallward 1
stopped 1
painting 1
looked 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
biting 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
huge 1
brushes 1
and 1
frowning 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
finished 1
he 1
cried 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
stooping 1
down 1
he 1
wrote 1
his 1
name 1
in 1
long 1
vermilion 1
letters 1
on 1
the 1
lefthand 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
canvas 1
lord 1
henry 1
came 1
over 1
and 1
examined 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
a 1
wonderful 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
likeness 1
as 1
well 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
most 1
warmly 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
finest 1
portrait 1
of 1
modern 1
times 1
mr 1
gray 1
come 1
over 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
yourself 1
the 1
lad 1
started 1
as 1
if 1
awakened 1
from 1
some 1
dream 1
is 1
it 1
really 1
finished 1
he 1
murmured 1
stepping 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
platform 1
quite 1
finished 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
sat 1
splendidly 1
today 1
i 1
am 1
awfully 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
is 1
entirely 1
due 1
to 1
me 1
broke 1
in 1
lord 1
henry 1
isnt 1
it 1
mr 1
gray 1
dorian 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
passed 1
listlessly 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
picture 1
and 1
turned 1
towards 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
with 1
pleasure 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
joy 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
recognized 1
himself 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
motionless 1
and 1
in 1
wonder 1
dimly 1
conscious 1
that 1
hallward 1
was 1
speaking 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
not 1
catching 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
came 1
on 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
revelation 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
felt 1
it 1
before 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
compliments 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
merely 1
the 1
charming 1
exaggeration 1
of 1
friendship 1
he 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
them 1
laughed 1
at 1
them 1
forgotten 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
influenced 1
his 1
nature 1
then 1
had 1
come 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
with 1
his 1
strange 1
panegyric 1
on 1
youth 1
his 1
terrible 1
warning 1
of 1
its 1
brevity 1
that 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
loveliness 1
the 1
full 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
description 1
flashed 1
across 1
him 1
yes 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
day 1
when 1
his 1
face 1
would 1
be 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
wizen 1
his 1
eyes 1
dim 1
and 1
colourless 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
his 1
figure 1
broken 1
and 1
deformed 1
the 1
scarlet 1
would 1
pass 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
steal 1
from 1
his 1
hair 1
the 1
life 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
soul 1
would 1
mar 1
his 1
body 1
he 1
would 1
become 1
dreadful 1
hideous 1
and 1
uncouth 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
sharp 1
pang 1
of 1
pain 1
struck 1
through 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
made 1
each 1
delicate 1
fibre 1
of 1
his 1
nature 1
quiver 1
his 1
eyes 1
deepened 1
into 1
amethyst 1
and 1
across 1
them 1
came 1
a 1
mist 1
of 1
tears 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
hand 1
of 1
ice 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
upon 1
his 1
heart 1
dont 1
you 1
like 1
it 1
cried 1
hallward 1
at 1
last 1
stung 1
a 1
little 1
by 1
the 1
lads 1
silence 1
not 1
understanding 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
likes 1
it 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
who 1
wouldnt 1
like 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
things 1
in 1
modern 1
art 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
anything 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
property 1
harry 1
whose 1
property 1
is 1
it 1
dorians 1
of 1
course 1
answered 1
the 1
painter 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
lucky 1
fellow 1
how 1
sad 1
it 1
is 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
still 1
fixed 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
portrait 1
how 1
sad 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
shall 1
grow 1
old 1
and 1
horrible 1
and 1
dreadful 1
but 1
this 1
picture 1
will 1
remain 1
always 1
young 1
it 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
older 1
than 1
this 1
particular 1
day 1
of 1
june 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
i 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
young 1
and 1
the 1
picture 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
grow 1
old 1
for 1
thatfor 1
thati 1
would 1
give 1
everything 1
yes 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
soul 1
for 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
hardly 1
care 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
arrangement 1
basil 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
rather 1
hard 1
lines 1
on 1
your 1
work 1
i 1
should 1
object 1
very 1
strongly 1
harry 1
said 1
hallward 1
dorian 1
gray 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
i 1
believe 1
you 1
would 1
basil 1
you 1
like 1
your 1
art 1
better 1
than 1
your 1
friends 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
you 1
than 1
a 1
green 1
bronze 1
figure 1
hardly 1
as 1
much 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
the 1
painter 1
stared 1
in 1
amazement 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
unlike 1
dorian 1
to 1
speak 1
like 1
that 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
he 1
seemed 1
quite 1
angry 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
flushed 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
burning 1
yes 1
he 1
continued 1
i 1
am 1
less 1
to 1
you 1
than 1
your 1
ivory 1
hermes 1
or 1
your 1
silver 1
faun 1
you 1
will 1
like 1
them 1
always 1
how 1
long 1
will 1
you 1
like 1

when 1

everything 1
your 1
picture 1
has 1
taught 1
me 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
is 1
perfectly 1
right 1
youth 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
when 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
growing 1
old 1

like 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
never 1

such 1
a 1
friend 1
as 1
you 1

i 1

jealous 1
of 1
everything 1
whose 1
beauty 1
does 1
not 1
die 1
i 1
am 1
jealous 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
you 1
have 1
painted 1
of 1
me 1
why 1
should 1
it 1
keep 1
what 1
i 1
must 1
lose 1
every 1
moment 1
that 1
passes 1
takes 1
something 1
from 1

gives 1
something 1
to 1

oh 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
if 1
the 1
picture 1
could 1
change 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
always 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
paint 1
it 1
it 1

mock 1
me 1

me 1
horribly 1

into 1

eyes 1
he 1
tore 1
his 1
hand 1
away 1
and 1
flinging 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
he 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
cushions 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
praying 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
doing 1
harry 1

you 1

gone 1
away 1

i 1

between 1

you 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
hate 1
the 1
finest 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
destroy 1
it 1
what 1
is 1
it 1

and 1
colour 1
i 1
will 1
not 1

across 1

three 1
lives 1

dorian 1
gray 1
lifted 1
his 1
golden 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
pillow 1
and 1
with 1
pallid 1
face 1
and 1
tearstained 1
eyes 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
deal 1
paintingtable 1
that 1
was 1
set 1
beneath 1
the 1
high 1
curtained 1
window 1
what 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
there 1
his 1
fingers 1
were 1
straying 1
about 1
among 1
the 1
litter 1
of 1
tin 1
tubes 1
and 1
dry 1
brushes 1
seeking 1
for 1
something 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
long 1
paletteknife 1
with 1
its 1
thin 1
blade 1
of 1
lithe 1
steel 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rip 1
up 1
the 1
canvas 1
with 1
a 1
stifled 1
sob 1
the 1
lad 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
rushing 1
over 1
to 1
hallward 1
tore 1
the 1
knife 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
flung 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
studio 1
dont 1
basil 1
dont 1
he 1
cried 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
murder 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
you 1
appreciate 1
my 1
work 1
at 1
last 1
dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
coldly 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
surprise 1
i 1
never 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
appreciate 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
it 1
basil 1
it 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
myself 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
well 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
dry 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
varnished 1
and 1
framed 1
and 1
sent 1
home 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
what 1
you 1
like 1
with 1
yourself 1
and 1
he 1
walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
tea 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
tea 1
of 1
course 1
dorian 1
and 1
so 1
will 1
you 1
harry 1
or 1
do 1
you 1
object 1
to 1
such 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
i 1
adore 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
last 1
refuge 1
of 1
the 1
complex 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
scenes 1
except 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
what 1
absurd 1
fellows 1
you 1
are 1
both 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
wonder 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
defined 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
rational 1
animal 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
premature 1
definition 1
ever 1
given 1
man 1
is 1
many 1
things 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
rational 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
after 1
allthough 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
chaps 1
would 1
not 1
squabble 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
you 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
it 1
basil 1
this 1
silly 1
boy 1
doesnt 1
really 1
want 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
really 1
do 1
if 1
you 1
let 1
any 1
one 1
have 1
it 1
but 1
me 1
basil 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forgive 1
you 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
allow 1
people 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
a 1
silly 1
boy 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
picture 1
is 1
yours 1
dorian 1
i 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
it 1
existed 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
little 1
silly 1
mr 1
gray 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
dont 1
really 1
object 1
to 1
being 1
reminded 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
extremely 1
young 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
objected 1
very 1
strongly 1
this 1
morning 1
lord 1
henry 1
ah 1
this 1
morning 1
you 1
have 1
lived 1
since 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
butler 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
laden 1
teatray 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
japanese 1
table 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rattle 1
of 1
cups 1
and 1
saucers 1
and 1
the 1
hissing 1
of 1
a 1
fluted 1
georgian 1
urn 1
two 1
globeshaped 1
china 1
dishes 1
were 1
brought 1
in 1
by 1
a 1
page 1
dorian 1
gray 1
went 1
over 1
and 1
poured 1
out 1
the 1
tea 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
sauntered 1
languidly 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
examined 1
what 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
covers 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
tonight 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
there 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
on 1
somewhere 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
dine 1
at 1
whites 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
send 1
him 1
a 1
wire 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
ill 1
or 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
prevented 1
from 1
coming 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
a 1
subsequent 1
engagement 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
rather 1
nice 1
excuse 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
surprise 1
of 1
candour 1
it 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
bore 1
putting 1
on 1
ones 1
dressclothes 1
muttered 1
hallward 1
and 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
them 1
on 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
horrid 1
yes 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
dreamily 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
is 1
detestable 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
sombre 1
so 1
depressing 1
sin 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
real 1
colourelement 1
left 1
in 1
modern 1
life 1
you 1
really 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
dorian 1
harry 1
before 1
which 1
dorian 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
pouring 1
out 1
tea 1
for 1
us 1
or 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
before 1
either 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
with 1
you 1
lord 1
henry 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
then 1
you 1
shall 1
come 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
too 1
basil 1
wont 1
you 1
i 1
cant 1
really 1
i 1
would 1
sooner 1
not 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
well 1
then 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
alone 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
awfully 1
the 1
painter 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
cup 1
in 1
hand 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
i 1
shall 1
stay 1
with 1
the 1
real 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
sadly 1
is 1
it 1
the 1
real 1
dorian 1
cried 1
the 1
original 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
strolling 1
across 1
to 1
him 1
am 1
i 1
really 1
like 1
that 1
yes 1
you 1
are 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
how 1
wonderful 1
basil 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
appearance 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
never 1
alter 1
sighed 1
hallward 1
that 1
is 1
something 1
what 1
a 1
fuss 1
people 1
make 1
about 1
fidelity 1
exclaimed 1
lord 1
henry 1
why 1
even 1
in 1
love 1
it 1
is 1
purely 1
a 1
question 1
for 1
physiology 1
it 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
our 1
own 1
will 1
young 1
men 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
faithful 1
and 1
are 1
not 1
old 1
men 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
faithless 1
and 1
cannot 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
dont 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
tonight 1
dorian 1
said 1
hallward 1
stop 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
cant 1
basil 1
why 1
because 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
wont 1
like 1
you 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
keeping 1
your 1
promises 1
he 1
always 1
breaks 1
his 1
own 1
i 1
beg 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
dorian 1
gray 1
laughed 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
the 1
lad 1
hesitated 1
and 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
who 1
was 1
watching 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
teatable 1
with 1
an 1
amused 1
smile 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
basil 1
he 1
answered 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
hallward 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
over 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
his 1
cup 1
on 1
the 1
tray 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
late 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
dress 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
lose 1
no 1
time 1
goodbye 1
harry 1
goodbye 1
dorian 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
soon 1
come 1
tomorrow 1
certainly 1
you 1
wont 1
forget 1
no 1
of 1
course 1
not 1
cried 1
dorian 1
and 1
harry 1
yes 1
basil 1
remember 1
what 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
have 1
forgotten 1
it 1
i 1
trust 1
you 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
trust 1
myself 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughing 1
come 1
mr 1
gray 1
my 1
hansom 1
is 1
outside 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
drop 1
you 1
at 1
your 1
own 1
place 1
goodbye 1
basil 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
afternoon 1
as 1
the 1
door 1
closed 1
behind 1
them 1
the 1
painter 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
sofa 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
face 1
chapter 1
3 1
at 1
halfpast 1
twelve 1
next 1
day 1
lord 1
henry 1
wotton 1
strolled 1
from 1
curzon 1
street 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
albany 1
to 1
call 1
on 1
his 1
uncle 1
lord 1
fermor 1
a 1
genial 1
if 1
somewhat 1
roughmannered 1
old 1
bachelor 1
whom 1
the 1
outside 1
world 1
called 1
selfish 1
because 1
it 1
derived 1
no 1
particular 1
benefit 1
from 1
him 1
but 1
who 1
was 1
considered 1
generous 1
by 1
society 1
as 1
he 1
fed 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
amused 1
him 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
been 1
our 1
ambassador 1
at 1
madrid 1
when 1
isabella 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
prim 1
unthought 1
of 1
but 1
had 1
retired 1
from 1
the 1
diplomatic 1
service 1
in 1
a 1
capricious 1
moment 1
of 1
annoyance 1
on 1
not 1
being 1
offered 1
the 1
embassy 1
at 1
paris 1
a 1
post 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
considered 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
fully 1
entitled 1
by 1
reason 1
of 1
his 1
birth 1
his 1
indolence 1
the 1
good 1
english 1
of 1
his 1
dispatches 1
and 1
his 1
inordinate 1
passion 1
for 1
pleasure 1
the 1
son 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
fathers 1
secretary 1
had 1
resigned 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
chief 1
somewhat 1
foolishly 1
as 1
was 1
thought 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
on 1
succeeding 1
some 1
months 1
later 1
to 1
the 1
title 1
had 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
serious 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
aristocratic 1
art 1
of 1
doing 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
he 1
had 1
two 1
large 1
town 1
houses 1
but 1
preferred 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
chambers 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
trouble 1
and 1
took 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
meals 1
at 1
his 1
club 1
he 1
paid 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
his 1
collieries 1
in 1
the 1
midland 1
counties 1
excusing 1
himself 1
for 1
this 1
taint 1
of 1
industry 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
advantage 1
of 1
having 1
coal 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
enabled 1
a 1
gentleman 1
to 1
afford 1
the 1
decency 1
of 1
burning 1
wood 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
hearth 1
in 1
politics 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
tory 1
except 1
when 1
the 1
tories 1
were 1
in 1
office 1
during 1
which 1
period 1
he 1
roundly 1
abused 1
them 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
radicals 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
hero 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
who 1
bullied 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
terror 1
to 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
relations 1
whom 1
he 1
bullied 1
in 1
turn 1
only 1
england 1
could 1
have 1
produced 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
always 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
dogs 1
his 1
principles 1
were 1
out 1
of 1
date 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
his 1
prejudices 1
when 1
lord 1
henry 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
uncle 1
sitting 1
in 1
a 1
rough 1
shootingcoat 1
smoking 1
a 1
cheroot 1
and 1
grumbling 1
over 1
_the 1
times_ 1
well 1
harry 1

the 1
old 1
gentleman 1

murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
settling 1
his 1
buttonhole 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
when 1

dartmoors 1
tradesmen 1

consequently 1
they 1
never 1
bother 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
want 1

not 1
useful 1
information 1

lot 1
of 1
nonsense 1

quite 1
enough 1
and 1
if 1
he 1

christening 1
she 1
was 1
an 1
extraordinarily 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
margaret 1
devereux 1
and 1
made 1
all 1
the 1
men 1
frantic 1
by 1
running 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
penniless 1
young 1
fellowa 1
mere 1
nobody 1
sir 1
a 1
subaltern 1
in 1
a 1
foot 1
regiment 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
certainly 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
as 1
if 1

poor 1
chap 1

duel 1
at 1

a 1
few 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
marriage 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
ugly 1
story 1
about 1
it 1
they 1
said 1
kelso 1
got 1
some 1
rascally 1
adventurer 1
some 1
belgian 1
brute 1
to 1

his 1
soninlaw 1
in 1
publicpaid 1
him 1
sir 1

that 1
the 1
fellow 1
spitted 1
his 1
man 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
pigeon 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
hushed 1
up 1
but 1
egad 1
kelso 1
ate 1
his 1
chop 1
alone 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
afterwards 1
he 1
brought 1
his 1
daughter 1
back 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
she 1
never 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
oh 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bad 1
business 1
the 1
girl 1
died 1
too 1
died 1
within 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
she 1
left 1
a 1
son 1
did 1
she 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
that 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
boy 1
is 1
he 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
like 1
his 1
mother 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
goodlooking 1
chap 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
goodlooking 1
assented 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
hope 1
he 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
proper 1
hands 1
continued 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
money 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
if 1
kelso 1
did 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
by 1
him 1
his 1
mother 1
had 1
money 1
too 1
all 1
the 1
selby 1
property 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
through 1
her 1
grandfather 1
her 1
grandfather 1
hated 1
kelso 1
thought 1
him 1
a 1
mean 1
dog 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
came 1
to 1
madrid 1
once 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
there 1
egad 1
i 1
was 1
ashamed 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
queen 1
used 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
english 1
noble 1
who 1
was 1
always 1
quarrelling 1
with 1
the 1
cabmen 1
about 1
their 1
fares 1
they 1
made 1
quite 1
a 1
story 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
didnt 1
dare 1
show 1
my 1
face 1
at 1
court 1
for 1
a 1
month 1
i 1
hope 1
he 1
treated 1
his 1
grandson 1
better 1
than 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
jarvies 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
will 1
be 1
well 1
off 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
of 1
age 1
yet 1
he 1
has 1
selby 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
margaret 1
devereux 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loveliest 1
creatures 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
harry 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
induced 1
her 1
to 1
behave 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
i 1
never 1
could 1
understand 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
married 1
anybody 1
she 1
chose 1
carlington 1
was 1
mad 1
after 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
romantic 1
though 1
all 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
that 1
family 1
were 1
the 1
men 1
were 1
a 1
poor 1
lot 1
but 1
egad 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
wonderful 1
carlington 1
went 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
to 1
her 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
himself 1
she 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
there 1
wasnt 1
a 1
girl 1
in 1
london 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
who 1
wasnt 1
after 1
him 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
harry 1
talking 1
about 1
silly 1
marriages 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
humbug 1
your 1
father 1
tells 1
me 1
about 1
dartmoor 1
wanting 1
to 1
marry 1
an 1
american 1
aint 1
english 1
girls 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
fashionable 1
to 1
marry 1
americans 1
just 1
now 1
uncle 1
george 1
ill 1
back 1
english 1
women 1
against 1
the 1
world 1
harry 1
said 1
lord 1
fermor 1
striking 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
the 1
betting 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
americans 1
they 1
dont 1
last 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
muttered 1
his 1
uncle 1
a 1
long 1
engagement 1
exhausts 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
capital 1
at 1
a 1
steeplechase 1
they 1
take 1
things 1
flying 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
dartmoor 1
has 1
a 1
chance 1
who 1
are 1
her 1
people 1
grumbled 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
has 1
she 1
got 1
any 1
lord 1
henry 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
american 1
girls 1
are 1
as 1
clever 1
at 1
concealing 1
their 1
parents 1
as 1
english 1
women 1
are 1
at 1
concealing 1
their 1
past 1
he 1
said 1
rising 1
to 1
go 1
they 1
are 1
porkpackers 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
hope 1
so 1
uncle 1
george 1
for 1
dartmoors 1
sake 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
that 1
porkpacking 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
lucrative 1
profession 1
in 1
america 1
after 1
politics 1
is 1
she 1
pretty 1
she 1
behaves 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
beautiful 1
most 1
american 1
women 1
do 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
their 1
charm 1
why 1
cant 1
these 1
american 1
women 1
stay 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
country 1
they 1
are 1
always 1
telling 1
us 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
paradise 1
for 1
women 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
like 1
eve 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
excessively 1
anxious 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
goodbye 1
uncle 1
george 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
late 1
for 1
lunch 1
if 1
i 1
stop 1
any 1
longer 1
thanks 1
for 1
giving 1
me 1
the 1
information 1
i 1
wanted 1
i 1
always 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
my 1
new 1
friends 1
and 1
nothing 1
about 1
my 1
old 1
ones 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
lunching 1
harry 1
at 1
aunt 1
agathas 1
i 1
have 1
asked 1
myself 1
and 1
mr 1
gray 1
he 1
is 1
her 1
latest 1
_protege_ 1
humph 1
tell 1
your 1
aunt 1
agatha 1
harry 1
not 1
to 1
bother 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
with 1
her 1
charity 1
appeals 1
i 1
am 1
sick 1
of 1
them 1
why 1
the 1
good 1
woman 1
thinks 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
to 1
write 1
cheques 1
for 1
her 1
silly 1
fads 1
all 1
right 1
uncle 1
george 1
ill 1
tell 1
her 1
but 1
it 1
wont 1
have 1
any 1
effect 1
philanthropic 1
people 1
lose 1
all 1
sense 1
of 1
humanity 1
it 1
is 1
their 1
distinguishing 1
characteristic 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
growled 1
approvingly 1
and 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
his 1
servant 1
lord 1
henry 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
low 1
arcade 1
into 1
burlington 1
street 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
berkeley 1
square 1
so 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
dorian 1
grays 1
parentage 1
crudely 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
yet 1
stirred 1
him 1
by 1
its 1
suggestion 1
of 1
a 1
strange 1
almost 1
modern 1
romance 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
risking 1
everything 1
for 1
a 1
mad 1
passion 1
a 1
few 1
wild 1
weeks 1
of 1
happiness 1
cut 1
short 1
by 1
a 1
hideous 1
treacherous 1
crime 1
months 1
of 1
voiceless 1
agony 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
child 1
born 1
in 1
pain 1
the 1
mother 1
snatched 1
away 1
by 1
death 1
the 1
boy 1
left 1
to 1
solitude 1
and 1
the 1
tyranny 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
loveless 1
man 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
interesting 1
background 1
it 1
posed 1
the 1
lad 1
made 1
him 1
more 1
perfect 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
behind 1
every 1
exquisite 1
thing 1
that 1
existed 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
tragic 1
worlds 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
travail 1
that 1
the 1
meanest 1
flower 1
might 1
blow 1
and 1
how 1
charming 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
dinner 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
as 1
with 1
startled 1
eyes 1
and 1
lips 1
parted 1
in 1
frightened 1
pleasure 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
the 1
red 1
candleshades 1
staining 1
to 1
a 1
richer 1
rose 1
the 1
wakening 1
wonder 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
talking 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
like 1
playing 1
upon 1
an 1
exquisite 1
violin 1
he 1
answered 1
to 1
every 1
touch 1
and 1
thrill 1
of 1
the 1
bow 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
terribly 1
enthralling 1
in 1
the 1
exercise 1
of 1
influence 1
no 1
other 1
activity 1
was 1
like 1
it 1
to 1
project 1
ones 1
soul 1
into 1
some 1
gracious 1
form 1
and 1
let 1
it 1
tarry 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
hear 1
ones 1
own 1
intellectual 1
views 1
echoed 1
back 1
to 1
one 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
added 1
music 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
youth 1
to 1
convey 1
ones 1
temperament 1
into 1
another 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
subtle 1
fluid 1
or 1
a 1
strange 1
perfume 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
joy 1
in 1
thatperhaps 1
the 1
most 1
satisfying 1
joy 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
so 1
limited 1
and 1
vulgar 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
an 1
age 1
grossly 1
carnal 1
in 1
its 1
pleasures 1
and 1
grossly 1
common 1
in 1
its 1
aims 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
marvellous 1
type 1
too 1
this 1
lad 1
whom 1
by 1
so 1
curious 1
a 1
chance 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
in 1
basils 1
studio 1
or 1
could 1
be 1
fashioned 1
into 1
a 1
marvellous 1
type 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
grace 1
was 1
his 1
and 1
the 1
white 1
purity 1
of 1
boyhood 1
and 1
beauty 1
such 1
as 1
old 1
greek 1
marbles 1
kept 1
for 1
us 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
that 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
made 1
a 1
titan 1
or 1
a 1
toy 1
what 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
such 1
beauty 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
fade 1
and 1
basil 1
from 1
a 1
psychological 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
how 1
interesting 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
new 1
manner 1
in 1
art 1
the 1
fresh 1
mode 1
of 1
looking 1
at 1
life 1
suggested 1
so 1
strangely 1
by 1
the 1
merely 1
visible 1
presence 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
unconscious 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
silent 1
spirit 1
that 1
dwelt 1
in 1
dim 1
woodland 1
and 1
walked 1
unseen 1
in 1
open 1
field 1
suddenly 1
showing 1
herself 1
dryadlike 1
and 1
not 1
afraid 1
because 1
in 1
his 1
soul 1
who 1
sought 1
for 1
her 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
wakened 1
that 1
wonderful 1
vision 1
to 1
which 1
alone 1
are 1
wonderful 1
things 1
revealed 1
the 1
mere 1
shapes 1
and 1
patterns 1
of 1
things 1
becoming 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
refined 1
and 1
gaining 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
symbolical 1
value 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
themselves 1
patterns 1
of 1
some 1
other 1
and 1
more 1
perfect 1
form 1
whose 1
shadow 1
they 1
made 1
real 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
all 1
was 1
he 1
remembered 1
something 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
history 1
was 1
it 1
not 1
plato 1
that 1
artist 1
in 1
thought 1
who 1
had 1
first 1
analyzed 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
not 1
buonarotti 1
who 1
had 1
carved 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
coloured 1
marbles 1
of 1
a 1
sonnetsequence 1
but 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
century 1
it 1
was 1
strange 1
yes 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
dorian 1
gray 1
what 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
had 1
fashioned 1
the 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
he 1
would 1
seek 1
to 1
dominate 1
himhad 1
already 1
indeed 1
half 1
done 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
that 1
wonderful 1
spirit 1
his 1
own 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
fascinating 1
in 1
this 1
son 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
death 1
suddenly 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
glanced 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
houses 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
his 1
aunts 1
some 1
distance 1
and 1
smiling 1
to 1
himself 1
turned 1
back 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
somewhat 1
sombre 1
hall 1
the 1
butler 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
in 1
to 1
lunch 1
he 1
gave 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
stick 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
diningroom 1
late 1
as 1
usual 1
harry 1
cried 1
his 1
aunt 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
at 1
him 1
he 1
invented 1
a 1
facile 1
excuse 1
and 1
having 1
taken 1
the 1
vacant 1
seat 1
next 1
to 1
her 1
looked 1
round 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
dorian 1
bowed 1
to 1
him 1
shyly 1
from 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
a 1
flush 1
of 1
pleasure 1
stealing 1
into 1
his 1
cheek 1
opposite 1
was 1
the 1
duchess 1
of 1
harley 1
a 1
lady 1
of 1
admirable 1
goodnature 1
and 1
good 1
temper 1
much 1
liked 1
by 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
of 1
those 1
ample 1
architectural 1
proportions 1
that 1
in 1
women 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
duchesses 1
are 1
described 1
by 1
contemporary 1
historians 1
as 1
stoutness 1
next 1
to 1
her 1
sat 1
on 1
her 1
right 1
sir 1
thomas 1
burdon 1
a 1
radical 1
member 1
of 1
parliament 1
who 1
followed 1
his 1
leader 1
in 1
public 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
private 1
life 1
followed 1
the 1
best 1
cooks 1
dining 1
with 1
the 1
tories 1
and 1
thinking 1
with 1
the 1
liberals 1
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
a 1
wise 1
and 1
wellknown 1
rule 1
the 1
post 1
on 1
her 1
left 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
mr 1
erskine 1
of 1
treadley 1
an 1
old 1
gentleman 1
of 1
considerable 1
charm 1
and 1
culture 1
who 1
had 1
fallen 1
however 1
into 1
bad 1
habits 1
of 1
silence 1
having 1
as 1
he 1
explained 1
once 1
to 1
lady 1
agatha 1
said 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
thirty 1
his 1
own 1
neighbour 1
was 1
mrs 1
vandeleur 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
aunts 1
oldest 1
friends 1
a 1
perfect 1
saint 1
amongst 1
women 1
but 1
so 1
dreadfully 1
dowdy 1
that 1
she 1
reminded 1
one 1
of 1
a 1
badly 1
bound 1
hymnbook 1
fortunately 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
lord 1
faudel 1
a 1
most 1
intelligent 1
middleaged 1
mediocrity 1
as 1
bald 1
as 1
a 1
ministerial 1
statement 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
commons 1
with 1
whom 1
she 1
was 1
conversing 1
in 1
that 1
intensely 1
earnest 1
manner 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
unpardonable 1
error 1
as 1
he 1
remarked 1
once 1
himself 1
that 1
all 1
really 1
good 1
people 1
fall 1
into 1
and 1
from 1
which 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
ever 1
quite 1
escape 1
we 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
poor 1
dartmoor 1
lord 1
henry 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
nodding 1
pleasantly 1
to 1
him 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
he 1
will 1
really 1
marry 1
this 1
fascinating 1
young 1
person 1
i 1
believe 1
she 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
him 1
duchess 1
how 1
dreadful 1
exclaimed 1
lady 1
agatha 1
really 1
some 1
one 1
should 1
interfere 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
on 1
excellent 1
authority 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
keeps 1
an 1
american 1
drygoods 1
store 1
said 1
sir 1
thomas 1
burdon 1
looking 1
supercilious 1
my 1
uncle 1
has 1
already 1
suggested 1
porkpacking 1
sir 1
thomas 1
drygoods 1
what 1
are 1
american 1
drygoods 1
asked 1
the 1
duchess 1
raising 1
her 1
large 1
hands 1
in 1
wonder 1
and 1
accentuating 1
the 1
verb 1
american 1
novels 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
helping 1
himself 1
to 1
some 1
quail 1
the 1
duchess 1
looked 1
puzzled 1
dont 1
mind 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
whispered 1
lady 1
agatha 1
he 1
never 1
means 1
anything 1
that 1
he 1
says 1
when 1
america 1
was 1
discovered 1
said 1
the 1
radical 1
memberand 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
give 1
some 1
wearisome 1
facts 1
like 1
all 1
people 1
who 1
try 1
to 1
exhaust 1
a 1
subject 1
he 1
exhausted 1
his 1
listeners 1
the 1
duchess 1
sighed 1
and 1
exercised 1
her 1
privilege 1
of 1
interruption 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
it 1
never 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
at 1
all 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
really 1
our 1
girls 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
nowadays 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
unfair 1
perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
america 1
never 1
has 1
been 1
discovered 1
said 1
mr 1
erskine 1
i 1
myself 1
would 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
merely 1
been 1
detected 1
oh 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
specimens 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
vaguely 1
i 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
extremely 1
pretty 1
and 1
they 1
dress 1
well 1
too 1
they 1
get 1
all 1
their 1
dresses 1
in 1
paris 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
afford 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
when 1
good 1
americans 1
die 1
they 1
go 1
to 1
paris 1
chuckled 1
sir 1
thomas 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
large 1
wardrobe 1
of 1
humours 1
castoff 1
clothes 1
really 1
and 1
where 1
do 1
bad 1
americans 1
go 1
to 1
when 1
they 1
die 1
inquired 1
the 1
duchess 1
they 1
go 1
to 1
america 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
sir 1
thomas 1
frowned 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
your 1
nephew 1
is 1
prejudiced 1
against 1
that 1
great 1
country 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
lady 1
agatha 1
i 1
have 1
travelled 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
in 1
cars 1
provided 1
by 1
the 1
directors 1
who 1
in 1
such 1
matters 1
are 1
extremely 1
civil 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
education 1
to 1
visit 1
it 1
but 1
must 1
we 1
really 1
see 1
chicago 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
educated 1
asked 1
mr 1
erskine 1
plaintively 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
journey 1
sir 1
thomas 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
mr 1
erskine 1
of 1
treadley 1
has 1
the 1
world 1
on 1
his 1
shelves 1
we 1
practical 1
men 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
things 1
not 1
to 1
read 1
about 1
them 1
the 1
americans 1
are 1
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
people 1
they 1
are 1
absolutely 1
reasonable 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
their 1
distinguishing 1
characteristic 1
yes 1
mr 1
erskine 1
an 1
absolutely 1
reasonable 1
people 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
nonsense 1
about 1
the 1
americans 1
how 1
dreadful 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
can 1
stand 1
brute 1
force 1
but 1
brute 1
reason 1
is 1
quite 1
unbearable 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
unfair 1
about 1
its 1
use 1
it 1
is 1
hitting 1
below 1
the 1
intellect 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
you 1
said 1
sir 1
thomas 1
growing 1
rather 1
red 1
i 1
do 1
lord 1
henry 1
murmured 1
mr 1
erskine 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
paradoxes 1
are 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
in 1
their 1
way 1
rejoined 1
the 1
baronet 1
was 1
that 1
a 1
paradox 1
asked 1
mr 1
erskine 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
paradoxes 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
truth 1
to 1
test 1
reality 1
we 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
tight 1
rope 1
when 1
the 1
verities 1
become 1
acrobats 1
we 1
can 1
judge 1
them 1
dear 1
me 1
said 1
lady 1
agatha 1
how 1
you 1
men 1
argue 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
i 1
never 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
oh 1
harry 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
vexed 1
with 1
you 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
our 1
nice 1
mr 1
dorian 1
gray 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
east 1
end 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
invaluable 1
they 1
would 1
love 1
his 1
playing 1
i 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
play 1
to 1
me 1
cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiling 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
bright 1
answering 1
glance 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
unhappy 1
in 1
whitechapel 1
continued 1
lady 1
agatha 1
i 1
can 1
sympathize 1
with 1
everything 1
except 1
suffering 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
shrugging 1
his 1
shoulders 1
i 1
cannot 1
sympathize 1
with 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
ugly 1
too 1
horrible 1
too 1
distressing 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
terribly 1
morbid 1
in 1
the 1
modern 1
sympathy 1
with 1
pain 1
one 1
should 1
sympathize 1
with 1
the 1
colour 1
the 1
beauty 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
less 1
said 1
about 1
lifes 1
sores 1
the 1
better 1
still 1
the 1
east 1
end 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
important 1
problem 1
remarked 1
sir 1
thomas 1
with 1
a 1
grave 1
shake 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
quite 1
so 1
answered 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
problem 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
we 1
try 1
to 1
solve 1
it 1
by 1
amusing 1
the 1
slaves 1
the 1
politician 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
keenly 1
what 1
change 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
then 1
he 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughed 1
i 1
dont 1
desire 1
to 1
change 1
anything 1
in 1
england 1
except 1
the 1
weather 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
content 1
with 1
philosophic 1
contemplation 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
has 1
gone 1
bankrupt 1
through 1
an 1
overexpenditure 1
of 1
sympathy 1
i 1
would 1
suggest 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
appeal 1
to 1
science 1
to 1
put 1
us 1
straight 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
emotions 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
lead 1
us 1
astray 1
and 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
science 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
emotional 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
such 1
grave 1
responsibilities 1
ventured 1
mrs 1
vandeleur 1
timidly 1
terribly 1
grave 1
echoed 1
lady 1
agatha 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
mr 1
erskine 1
humanity 1
takes 1
itself 1
too 1
seriously 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
worlds 1
original 1
sin 1
if 1
the 1
caveman 1
had 1
known 1
how 1
to 1
laugh 1
history 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
different 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
very 1
comforting 1
warbled 1
the 1
duchess 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
felt 1
rather 1
guilty 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
dear 1
aunt 1
for 1
i 1
take 1
no 1
interest 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
end 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
look 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
blush 1
a 1
blush 1
is 1
very 1
becoming 1
duchess 1
remarked 1
lord 1
henry 1
only 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
young 1
she 1
answered 1
when 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
like 1
myself 1
blushes 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
sign 1
ah 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
become 1
young 1
again 1
he 1
thought 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
can 1
you 1
remember 1
any 1
great 1
error 1
that 1
you 1
committed 1
in 1
your 1
early 1
days 1
duchess 1
he 1
asked 1
looking 1
at 1
her 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
i 1
fear 1
she 1
cried 1
then 1
commit 1
them 1
over 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
ones 1
youth 1
one 1
has 1
merely 1
to 1
repeat 1
ones 1
follies 1
a 1
delightful 1
theory 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
i 1
must 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
practice 1
a 1
dangerous 1
theory 1
came 1
from 1
sir 1
thomass 1
tight 1
lips 1
lady 1
agatha 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
amused 1
mr 1
erskine 1
listened 1
yes 1
he 1
continued 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
nowadays 1
most 1
people 1
die 1
of 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
creeping 1
common 1
sense 1
and 1
discover 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
things 1
one 1
never 1
regrets 1
are 1
ones 1
mistakes 1
a 1
laugh 1
ran 1
round 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
played 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
grew 1
wilful 1
tossed 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
transformed 1
it 1
let 1
it 1
escape 1
and 1
recaptured 1
it 1
made 1
it 1
iridescent 1
with 1
fancy 1
and 1
winged 1
it 1
with 1
paradox 1
the 1
praise 1
of 1
folly 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
soared 1
into 1
a 1
philosophy 1
and 1
philosophy 1
herself 1
became 1
young 1
and 1
catching 1
the 1
mad 1
music 1
of 1
pleasure 1
wearing 1
one 1
might 1
fancy 1
her 1
winestained 1
robe 1
and 1
wreath 1
of 1
ivy 1
danced 1
like 1
a 1
bacchante 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
mocked 1
the 1
slow 1
silenus 1
for 1
being 1
sober 1
facts 1
fled 1
before 1
her 1
like 1
frightened 1
forest 1
things 1
her 1
white 1
feet 1
trod 1
the 1
huge 1
press 1
at 1
which 1
wise 1
omar 1
sits 1
till 1
the 1
seething 1
grapejuice 1
rose 1
round 1
her 1
bare 1
limbs 1
in 1
waves 1
of 1
purple 1
bubbles 1
or 1
crawled 1
in 1
red 1
foam 1
over 1
the 1
vats 1
black 1
dripping 1
sloping 1
sides 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
improvisation 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
dorian 1
gray 1
were 1
fixed 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
consciousness 1
that 1
amongst 1
his 1
audience 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
whose 1
temperament 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
fascinate 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
his 1
wit 1
keenness 1
and 1
to 1
lend 1
colour 1
to 1
his 1
imagination 1
he 1
was 1
brilliant 1
fantastic 1
irresponsible 1
he 1
charmed 1
his 1
listeners 1
out 1
of 1
themselves 1
and 1
they 1
followed 1
his 1
pipe 1
laughing 1
dorian 1
gray 1
never 1
took 1
his 1
gaze 1
off 1
him 1
but 1
sat 1
like 1
one 1
under 1
a 1
spell 1
smiles 1
chasing 1
each 1
other 1
over 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
wonder 1
growing 1
grave 1
in 1
his 1
darkening 1
eyes 1
at 1
last 1
liveried 1
in 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
the 1
age 1
reality 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
servant 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
duchess 1
that 1
her 1
carriage 1
was 1
waiting 1
she 1
wrung 1
her 1
hands 1
in 1
mock 1
despair 1
how 1
annoying 1
she 1
cried 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
my 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
to 1
some 1
absurd 1
meeting 1
at 1
williss 1
rooms 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
late 1
he 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
furious 1
and 1
i 1
couldnt 1
have 1
a 1
scene 1
in 1
this 1
bonnet 1
it 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
fragile 1
a 1
harsh 1
word 1
would 1
ruin 1
it 1
no 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
dear 1
agatha 1
goodbye 1
lord 1
henry 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
delightful 1
and 1
dreadfully 1
demoralizing 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
your 1
views 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
us 1
some 1
night 1
tuesday 1
are 1
you 1
disengaged 1
tuesday 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
would 1
throw 1
over 1
anybody 1
duchess 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
ah 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
very 1
wrong 1
of 1
you 1
she 1
cried 1
so 1
mind 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
she 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
followed 1
by 1
lady 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
ladies 1
when 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
mr 1
erskine 1
moved 1
round 1
and 1
taking 1
a 1
chair 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
placed 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
you 1
talk 1
books 1
away 1
he 1
said 1
why 1
dont 1
you 1
write 1
one 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
fond 1
of 1
reading 1
books 1
to 1
care 1
to 1
write 1
them 1
mr 1
erskine 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
write 1
a 1
novel 1
certainly 1
a 1
novel 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
lovely 1
as 1
a 1
persian 1
carpet 1
and 1
as 1
unreal 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
literary 1
public 1
in 1
england 1
for 1
anything 1
except 1
newspapers 1
primers 1
and 1
encyclopaedias 1
of 1
all 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
english 1
have 1
the 1
least 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
literature 1
i 1
fear 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
answered 1
mr 1
erskine 1
i 1
myself 1
used 1
to 1
have 1
literary 1
ambitions 1
but 1
i 1
gave 1
them 1
up 1
long 1
ago 1
and 1
now 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
friend 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
call 1
you 1
so 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
meant 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
said 1
to 1
us 1
at 1
lunch 1
i 1
quite 1
forget 1
what 1
i 1
said 1
smiled 1
lord 1
henry 1
was 1
it 1
all 1
very 1
bad 1
very 1
bad 1
indeed 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
consider 1
you 1
extremely 1
dangerous 1
and 1
if 1
anything 1
happens 1
to 1
our 1
good 1
duchess 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
look 1
on 1
you 1
as 1
being 1
primarily 1
responsible 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
life 1
the 1
generation 1
into 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
born 1
was 1
tedious 1
some 1
day 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
of 1
london 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
treadley 1
and 1
expound 1
to 1
me 1
your 1
philosophy 1
of 1
pleasure 1
over 1
some 1
admirable 1
burgundy 1
i 1
am 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
possess 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
charmed 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
treadley 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
privilege 1
it 1
has 1
a 1
perfect 1
host 1
and 1
a 1
perfect 1
library 1
you 1
will 1
complete 1
it 1
answered 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
with 1
a 1
courteous 1
bow 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
must 1
bid 1
goodbye 1
to 1
your 1
excellent 1
aunt 1
i 1
am 1
due 1
at 1
the 1
athenaeum 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
we 1
sleep 1
there 1
all 1
of 1
you 1
mr 1
erskine 1
forty 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
forty 1
armchairs 1
we 1
are 1
practising 1
for 1
an 1
english 1
academy 1
of 1
letters 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughed 1
and 1
rose 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
he 1
cried 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
passing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
dorian 1
gray 1
touched 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
murmured 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
promised 1
basil 1
hallward 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
would 1
sooner 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
yes 1
i 1
feel 1
i 1
must 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
do 1
let 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
promise 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
no 1
one 1
talks 1
so 1
wonderfully 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
ah 1
i 1
have 1
talked 1
quite 1
enough 1
for 1
today 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
smiling 1
all 1
i 1
want 1
now 1
is 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
life 1
you 1
may 1
come 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
chapter 1
4 1
one 1
afternoon 1
a 1
month 1
later 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
reclining 1
in 1
a 1
luxurious 1
armchair 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
library 1
of 1
lord 1
henrys 1
house 1
in 1
mayfair 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
a 1
very 1
charming 1
room 1
with 1
its 1
high 1
panelled 1
wainscoting 1
of 1
olivestained 1
oak 1
its 1
creamcoloured 1
frieze 1
and 1
ceiling 1
of 1
raised 1
plasterwork 1
and 1
its 1
brickdust 1
felt 1
carpet 1
strewn 1
with 1
silk 1
longfringed 1
persian 1
rugs 1
on 1
a 1
tiny 1
satinwood 1
table 1
stood 1
a 1
statuette 1
by 1
clodion 1
and 1
beside 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
les 1
cent 1
nouvelles 1
bound 1
for 1
margaret 1
of 1
valois 1
by 1
clovis 1
eve 1
and 1
powdered 1
with 1
the 1
gilt 1
daisies 1
that 1
queen 1
had 1
selected 1
for 1
her 1
device 1
some 1
large 1
blue 1
china 1
jars 1
and 1
parrottulips 1
were 1
ranged 1
on 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
small 1
leaded 1
panes 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
streamed 1
the 1
apricotcoloured 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
summer 1
day 1
in 1
london 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
come 1
in 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
late 1
on 1
principle 1
his 1
principle 1
being 1
that 1
punctuality 1
is 1
the 1
thief 1
of 1
time 1
so 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
looking 1
rather 1
sulky 1
as 1
with 1
listless 1
fingers 1
he 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
an 1
elaborately 1
illustrated 1
edition 1
of 1
manon 1
lescaut 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
bookcases 1
the 1
formal 1
monotonous 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
louis 1
quatorze 1
clock 1
annoyed 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
going 1
away 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
step 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
how 1
late 1
you 1
are 1
harry 1
he 1
murmured 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
harry 1
mr 1
gray 1
answered 1
a 1
shrill 1
voice 1
he 1
glanced 1
quickly 1
round 1
and 1
rose 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
husband 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
his 1
wife 1
you 1
must 1
let 1
me 1
introduce 1
myself 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
quite 1
well 1
by 1
your 1
photographs 1
i 1
think 1
my 1
husband 1
has 1
got 1
seventeen 1
of 1
them 1
not 1
seventeen 1
lady 1
henry 1
well 1
eighteen 1
then 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
other 1
night 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
she 1
laughed 1
nervously 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
vague 1
forgetmenot 1
eyes 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
curious 1
woman 1
whose 1
dresses 1
always 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
designed 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
in 1
a 1
tempest 1
she 1
was 1
usually 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
somebody 1
and 1
as 1
her 1
passion 1
was 1
never 1
returned 1
she 1
had 1
kept 1
all 1
her 1
illusions 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
look 1
picturesque 1
but 1
only 1
succeeded 1
in 1
being 1
untidy 1
her 1
name 1
was 1
victoria 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
perfect 1
mania 1
for 1
going 1
to 1
church 1
that 1
was 1
at 1
lohengrin 1
lady 1
henry 1
i 1
think 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
dear 1
lohengrin 1
i 1
like 1
wagners 1
music 1
better 1
than 1
anybodys 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
talk 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
without 1
other 1
people 1
hearing 1
what 1
one 1
says 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
dont 1
you 1
think 1
so 1
mr 1
gray 1
the 1
same 1
nervous 1
staccato 1
laugh 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
thin 1
lips 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
tortoiseshell 1
paperknife 1
dorian 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
so 1
lady 1
henry 1
i 1
never 1
talk 1
during 1
musicat 1
least 1
during 1
good 1
music 1
if 1
one 1
hears 1
bad 1
music 1
it 1
is 1
ones 1
duty 1
to 1
drown 1
it 1
in 1
conversation 1
ah 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
harrys 1
views 1
isnt 1
it 1
mr 1
gray 1
i 1
always 1
hear 1
harrys 1
views 1
from 1
his 1
friends 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
i 1
get 1
to 1
know 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
good 1
music 1
i 1
adore 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
too 1
romantic 1
i 1
have 1
simply 1
worshipped 1
pianiststwo 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
sometimes 1
harry 1
tells 1
me 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
about 1
them 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
foreigners 1
they 1
all 1
are 1
aint 1
they 1
even 1
those 1
that 1
are 1
born 1
in 1
england 1
become 1
foreigners 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
dont 1
they 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
clever 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
compliment 1
to 1
art 1
makes 1
it 1
quite 1
cosmopolitan 1
doesnt 1
it 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
parties 1
have 1
you 1
mr 1
gray 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
i 1
cant 1
afford 1
orchids 1
but 1
i 1
spare 1
no 1
expense 1
in 1
foreigners 1
they 1
make 1
ones 1
rooms 1
look 1
so 1
picturesque 1
but 1
here 1

harry 1

came 1
in 1

look 1
for 1
you 1

somethingi 1
forget 1
what 1
it 1
wasand 1
i 1
found 1
mr 1

a 1
pleasant 1
chat 1
about 1
music 1
we 1
have 1
quite 1
the 1
same 1
ideas 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
our 1
ideas 1
are 1
quite 1
different 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
most 1
pleasant 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
ive 1
seen 1

charmed 1
my 1
love 1

charmed 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
dark 1
crescentshaped 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
them 1
both 1
with 1
an 1
amused 1
smile 1
so 1
sorry 1
i 1
am 1
late 1
dorian 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
old 1
brocade 1
in 1
wardour 1
street 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
bargain 1
for 1
hours 1
for 1
it 1
nowadays 1
people 1
know 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
everything 1
and 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
nothing 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
going 1
exclaimed 1
lady 1
henry 1
breaking 1
an 1
awkward 1
silence 1
with 1
her 1
silly 1
sudden 1
laugh 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
drive 1
with 1
the 1
duchess 1
goodbye 1
mr 1
gray 1
goodbye 1
harry 1
you 1
are 1
dining 1
out 1
i 1
suppose 1
so 1
am 1
i 1
perhaps 1
i 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
at 1
lady 1
thornburys 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
my 1
dear 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
her 1
as 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
bird 1
of 1
paradise 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
all 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
rain 1
she 1
flitted 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
leaving 1
a 1
faint 1
odour 1
of 1
frangipanni 1
then 1
he 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
never 1
marry 1
a 1
woman 1
with 1
strawcoloured 1
hair 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
puffs 1
why 1
harry 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
sentimental 1
but 1
i 1
like 1
sentimental 1
people 1
never 1
marry 1
at 1
all 1
dorian 1
men 1
marry 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
tired 1
women 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
curious 1
both 1
are 1
disappointed 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
likely 1
to 1
marry 1
harry 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
aphorisms 1
i 1
am 1
putting 1
it 1
into 1
practice 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
everything 1
that 1
you 1
say 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
with 1
an 1
actress 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
blushing 1
lord 1
henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
rather 1
commonplace 1
_debut_ 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
her 1
harry 1
who 1
is 1
she 1
her 1
name 1
is 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
people 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
however 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
genius 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
no 1
woman 1
is 1
a 1
genius 1
women 1
are 1
a 1
decorative 1
sex 1
they 1
never 1
have 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
but 1
they 1
say 1
it 1
charmingly 1
women 1
represent 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
matter 1
over 1
mind 1
just 1
as 1
men 1
represent 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
mind 1
over 1
morals 1
harry 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
i 1
am 1
analysing 1
women 1
at 1
present 1
so 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
subject 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
abstruse 1
as 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
ultimately 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
women 1
the 1
plain 1
and 1
the 1
coloured 1
the 1
plain 1
women 1
are 1
very 1
useful 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
for 1
respectability 1
you 1
have 1
merely 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
down 1
to 1
supper 1
the 1
other 1
women 1
are 1
very 1
charming 1
they 1
commit 1
one 1
mistake 1
however 1
they 1
paint 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
look 1
young 1
our 1
grandmothers 1
painted 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
talk 1
brilliantly 1
_rouge_ 1
and 1
_esprit_ 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
together 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
now 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
look 1
ten 1
years 1
younger 1
than 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
she 1
is 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
as 1
for 1
conversation 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
five 1
women 1
in 1
london 1
worth 1
talking 1
to 1
and 1
two 1
of 1
these 1
cant 1
be 1
admitted 1
into 1
decent 1
society 1
however 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
your 1
genius 1
how 1
long 1
have 1
you 1
known 1
her 1
ah 1
harry 1
your 1
views 1
terrify 1
me 1
never 1
mind 1
that 1
how 1
long 1
have 1
you 1
known 1
her 1
about 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
across 1
her 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
harry 1
but 1
you 1
mustnt 1
be 1
unsympathetic 1
about 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
never 1
would 1
have 1
happened 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
met 1
you 1
you 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
life 1
for 1
days 1
after 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
throb 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
as 1
i 1
lounged 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
or 1
strolled 1
down 1
piccadilly 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
passed 1
me 1
and 1
wonder 1
with 1
a 1
mad 1
curiosity 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
lives 1
they 1
led 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
fascinated 1
me 1
others 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
terror 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
exquisite 1
poison 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
passion 1
for 1
sensations 1
well 1
one 1
evening 1
about 1
seven 1
oclock 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
some 1
adventure 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
this 1
grey 1
monstrous 1
london 1
of 1
ours 1
with 1
its 1
myriads 1
of 1
people 1
its 1
sordid 1
sinners 1
and 1
its 1
splendid 1
sins 1
as 1
you 1
once 1
phrased 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
fancied 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
the 1
mere 1
danger 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
delight 1
i 1
remembered 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
that 1
wonderful 1
evening 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
dined 1
together 1
about 1
the 1
search 1
for 1
beauty 1
being 1
the 1
real 1
secret 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
expected 1
but 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
wandered 1
eastward 1
soon 1
losing 1
my 1
way 1
in 1
a 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
grimy 1
streets 1
and 1
black 1
grassless 1
squares 1
about 1
halfpast 1
eight 1
i 1
passed 1
by 1
an 1
absurd 1
little 1
theatre 1
with 1
great 1
flaring 1
gasjets 1
and 1
gaudy 1
playbills 1
a 1
hideous 1
jew 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
amazing 1
waistcoat 1
i 1
ever 1
beheld 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
smoking 1
a 1
vile 1
cigar 1
he 1
had 1
greasy 1
ringlets 1
and 1
an 1
enormous 1
diamond 1
blazed 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
a 1
soiled 1
shirt 1
have 1
a 1
box 1
my 1
lord 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
gorgeous 1
servility 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
him 1
harry 1
that 1
amused 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
you 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
i 1
really 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
whole 1
guinea 1
for 1
the 1
stagebox 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
i 1
cant 1
make 1
out 1
why 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
i 1
hadntmy 1
dear 1
harry 1
if 1
i 1
hadnti 1
should 1
have 1
missed 1
the 1
greatest 1
romance 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
are 1
laughing 1
it 1
is 1
horrid 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
laughing 1
dorian 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
laughing 1
at 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
say 1
the 1
greatest 1
romance 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
you 1
should 1
say 1
the 1
first 1
romance 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
loved 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
love 1
a 1
_grande 1
passion_ 1
is 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
idle 1
classes 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
dont 1
be 1
afraid 1
there 1
are 1
exquisite 1
things 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
you 1
this 1
is 1
merely 1
the 1
beginning 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
my 1
nature 1
so 1
shallow 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
angrily 1
no 1
i 1
think 1
your 1
nature 1
so 1
deep 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
love 1
only 1
once 1
in 1
their 1
lives 1
are 1
really 1
the 1
shallow 1
people 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
their 1
loyalty 1
and 1
their 1
fidelity 1
i 1
call 1
either 1
the 1
lethargy 1
of 1
custom 1
or 1
their 1
lack 1
of 1
imagination 1
faithfulness 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
emotional 1
life 1
what 1
consistency 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
intellectsimply 1
a 1
confession 1
of 1
failure 1
faithfulness 1
i 1
must 1
analyse 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
the 1
passion 1
for 1
property 1
is 1
in 1
it 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
things 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
throw 1
away 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
afraid 1
that 1
others 1
might 1
pick 1
them 1
up 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
interrupt 1
you 1
go 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
story 1
well 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
horrid 1
little 1
private 1
box 1
with 1
a 1
vulgar 1
dropscene 1
staring 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
i 1
looked 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
and 1
surveyed 1
the 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
tawdry 1
affair 1
all 1
cupids 1
and 1
cornucopias 1
like 1
a 1
thirdrate 1
weddingcake 1
the 1
gallery 1
and 1
pit 1
were 1
fairly 1
full 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
dingy 1
stalls 1
were 1
quite 1
empty 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
hardly 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
what 1
i 1
suppose 1
they 1
called 1
the 1
dresscircle 1
women 1
went 1
about 1
with 1
oranges 1
and 1
gingerbeer 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
terrible 1
consumption 1
of 1
nuts 1
going 1
on 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
palmy 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
british 1
drama 1
just 1
like 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
and 1
very 1
depressing 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
when 1
i 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
playbill 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
the 1
play 1
was 1
harry 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
the 1
idiot 1
boy 1
or 1
dumb 1
but 1
innocent 1
our 1
fathers 1
used 1
to 1
like 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
piece 1
i 1
believe 1
the 1
longer 1
i 1
live 1
dorian 1
the 1
more 1
keenly 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
whatever 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
our 1
fathers 1
is 1
not 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
in 1
art 1
as 1
in 1
politics 1
_les 1
grandperes 1
ont 1
toujours 1
tort_ 1
this 1
play 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
harry 1
it 1
was 1
romeo 1
and 1
juliet 1
i 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
rather 1
annoyed 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
seeing 1
shakespeare 1
done 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
wretched 1
hole 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
still 1
i 1
felt 1
interested 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
way 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
act 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dreadful 1
orchestra 1
presided 1
over 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
hebrew 1
who 1
sat 1
at 1
a 1
cracked 1
piano 1
that 1
nearly 1
drove 1
me 1
away 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
dropscene 1
was 1
drawn 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
play 1
began 1
romeo 1
was 1
a 1
stout 1
elderly 1
gentleman 1
with 1
corked 1
eyebrows 1
a 1
husky 1
tragedy 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
figure 1
like 1
a 1
beerbarrel 1
mercutio 1
was 1
almost 1
as 1
bad 1
he 1
was 1
played 1
by 1
the 1
lowcomedian 1
who 1
had 1
introduced 1
gags 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
was 1
on 1
most 1
friendly 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
pit 1
they 1
were 1
both 1
as 1
grotesque 1
as 1
the 1
scenery 1
and 1
that 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
countrybooth 1
but 1
juliet 1
harry 1
imagine 1
a 1
girl 1
hardly 1
seventeen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
flowerlike 1
face 1
a 1
small 1
greek 1
head 1
with 1
plaited 1
coils 1
of 1
darkbrown 1
hair 1
eyes 1
that 1
were 1
violet 1
wells 1
of 1
passion 1
lips 1
that 1
were 1
like 1
the 1
petals 1
of 1
a 1
rose 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
loveliest 1
thing 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
you 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
once 1
that 1
pathos 1
left 1
you 1
unmoved 1
but 1
that 1
beauty 1
mere 1
beauty 1
could 1
fill 1
your 1
eyes 1
with 1
tears 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
harry 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
this 1
girl 1
for 1
the 1
mist 1
of 1
tears 1
that 1
came 1
across 1
me 1
and 1
her 1
voicei 1
never 1
heard 1
such 1
a 1
voice 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
low 1
at 1
first 1
with 1
deep 1
mellow 1
notes 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
fall 1
singly 1
upon 1
ones 1
ear 1
then 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
little 1
louder 1
and 1
sounded 1
like 1
a 1
flute 1
or 1
a 1
distant 1
hautboy 1
in 1
the 1
gardenscene 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
tremulous 1
ecstasy 1
that 1
one 1
hears 1
just 1
before 1
dawn 1
when 1
nightingales 1
are 1
singing 1
there 1
were 1
moments 1
later 1
on 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
the 1
wild 1
passion 1
of 1
violins 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
a 1
voice 1
can 1
stir 1
one 1
your 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
are 1
two 1
things 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
when 1
i 1
close 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
hear 1
them 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
says 1
something 1
different 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
which 1
to 1
follow 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
not 1
love 1
her 1
harry 1
i 1
do 1
love 1
her 1
she 1
is 1
everything 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
life 1
night 1
after 1
night 1
i 1
go 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
play 1
one 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
rosalind 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
imogen 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
die 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
of 1
an 1
italian 1
tomb 1
sucking 1
the 1
poison 1
from 1
her 1
lovers 1
lips 1
i 1
have 1
watched 1
her 1
wandering 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
of 1
arden 1
disguised 1
as 1
a 1
pretty 1
boy 1
in 1
hose 1
and 1
doublet 1
and 1
dainty 1
cap 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
mad 1
and 1
has 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
guilty 1
king 1
and 1
given 1
him 1
rue 1
to 1
wear 1
and 1
bitter 1
herbs 1
to 1
taste 1
of 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
innocent 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
hands 1
of 1
jealousy 1
have 1
crushed 1
her 1
reedlike 1
throat 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
in 1
every 1
age 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
costume 1
ordinary 1
women 1
never 1
appeal 1
to 1
ones 1
imagination 1
they 1
are 1
limited 1
to 1
their 1
century 1
no 1
glamour 1
ever 1
transfigures 1
them 1
one 1
knows 1
their 1
minds 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
one 1
knows 1
their 1
bonnets 1
one 1
can 1
always 1
find 1
them 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
mystery 1
in 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
ride 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
chatter 1
at 1
teaparties 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
they 1
have 1
their 1
stereotyped 1
smile 1
and 1
their 1
fashionable 1
manner 1
they 1
are 1
quite 1
obvious 1
but 1
an 1
actress 1
how 1
different 1
an 1
actress 1
is 1
harry 1
why 1
didnt 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
loving 1
is 1
an 1
actress 1
because 1
i 1
have 1
loved 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
dorian 1
oh 1
yes 1
horrid 1
people 1
with 1
dyed 1
hair 1
and 1
painted 1
faces 1
dont 1
run 1
down 1
dyed 1
hair 1
and 1
painted 1
faces 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
charm 1
in 1
them 1
sometimes 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
i 1
wish 1
now 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
helped 1
telling 1
me 1
dorian 1
all 1
through 1
your 1
life 1
you 1
will 1
tell 1
me 1
everything 1
you 1
do 1
yes 1
harry 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
is 1
true 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
telling 1
you 1
things 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
curious 1
influence 1
over 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
ever 1
did 1
a 1
crime 1
i 1
would 1
come 1
and 1
confess 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
me 1
people 1
like 1
youthe 1
wilful 1
sunbeams 1
of 1
lifedont 1
commit 1
crimes 1
dorian 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
obliged 1
for 1
the 1
compliment 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
now 1
tell 1
mereach 1
me 1
the 1
matches 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
boythankswhat 1
are 1
your 1
actual 1
relations 1
with 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
dorian 1
gray 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
with 1
flushed 1
cheeks 1
and 1
burning 1
eyes 1
harry 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
is 1
sacred 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
sacred 1
things 1
that 1
are 1
worth 1
touching 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
touch 1
of 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
but 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
be 1
annoyed 1
i 1
suppose 1
she 1
will 1
belong 1
to 1
you 1
some 1
day 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
in 1
love 1
one 1
always 1
begins 1
by 1
deceiving 1
ones 1
self 1
and 1
one 1
always 1
ends 1
by 1
deceiving 1
others 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
a 1
romance 1
you 1
know 1
her 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
i 1
suppose 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
know 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
the 1
horrid 1
old 1
jew 1
came 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
box 1
after 1
the 1
performance 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
offered 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
behind 1
the 1
scenes 1
and 1
introduce 1
me 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
was 1
furious 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
juliet 1
had 1
been 1
dead 1
for 1
hundreds 1
of 1
years 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
body 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
a 1
marble 1
tomb 1
in 1
verona 1
i 1
think 1
from 1
his 1
blank 1
look 1
of 1
amazement 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
too 1
much 1
champagne 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
surprised 1
then 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
wrote 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
newspapers 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
never 1
even 1
read 1
them 1
he 1
seemed 1
terribly 1
disappointed 1
at 1
that 1
and 1
confided 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
dramatic 1
critics 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
conspiracy 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
bought 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
there 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
judging 1
from 1
their 1
appearance 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
cannot 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
expensive 1
well 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
they 1
were 1
beyond 1
his 1
means 1
laughed 1
dorian 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
however 1
the 1
lights 1
were 1
being 1
put 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
he 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
try 1
some 1
cigars 1
that 1
he 1
strongly 1
recommended 1
i 1
declined 1
the 1
next 1
night 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
he 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
low 1
bow 1
and 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
munificent 1
patron 1
of 1
art 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
offensive 1
brute 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
passion 1
for 1
shakespeare 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
pride 1
that 1
his 1
five 1
bankruptcies 1
were 1
entirely 1
due 1
to 1
the 1
bard 1
as 1
he 1
insisted 1
on 1
calling 1
him 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
a 1
distinction 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
distinction 1
my 1
dear 1
doriana 1
great 1
distinction 1
most 1
people 1
become 1
bankrupt 1
through 1
having 1
invested 1
too 1
heavily 1
in 1
the 1
prose 1
of 1
life 1
to 1
have 1
ruined 1
ones 1
self 1
over 1
poetry 1
is 1
an 1
honour 1
but 1
when 1
did 1
you 1
first 1
speak 1
to 1
miss 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
rosalind 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
going 1
round 1
i 1
had 1
thrown 1
her 1
some 1
flowers 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
looked 1
at 1
meat 1
least 1
i 1
fancied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
old 1
jew 1
was 1
persistent 1
he 1
seemed 1
determined 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
behind 1
so 1
i 1
consented 1
it 1
was 1
curious 1
my 1
not 1
wanting 1
to 1
know 1
her 1
wasnt 1
it 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
so 1
my 1
dear 1
harry 1
why 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
some 1
other 1
time 1
now 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
girl 1
sibyl 1
oh 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
shy 1
and 1
so 1
gentle 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
about 1
her 1
her 1
eyes 1
opened 1
wide 1
in 1
exquisite 1
wonder 1
when 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
what 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
performance 1
and 1
she 1
seemed 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
her 1
power 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
were 1
both 1
rather 1
nervous 1
the 1
old 1
jew 1
stood 1
grinning 1
at 1
the 1
doorway 1
of 1
the 1
dusty 1
greenroom 1
making 1
elaborate 1
speeches 1
about 1
us 1
both 1
while 1
we 1
stood 1
looking 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
like 1
children 1
he 1
would 1
insist 1
on 1
calling 1
me 1
my 1
lord 1
so 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
assure 1
sibyl 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
she 1
said 1
quite 1
simply 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
look 1
more 1
like 1
a 1
prince 1
i 1
must 1
call 1
you 1
prince 1
charming 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
dorian 1
miss 1
sibyl 1
knows 1
how 1
to 1
pay 1
compliments 1
you 1
dont 1
understand 1
her 1
harry 1
she 1
regarded 1
me 1
merely 1
as 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
a 1
play 1
she 1
knows 1
nothing 1
of 1
life 1
she 1
lives 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
a 1
faded 1
tired 1
woman 1
who 1
played 1
lady 1
capulet 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
magenta 1
dressingwrapper 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
and 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
better 1
days 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
look 1
it 1
depresses 1
me 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
examining 1
his 1
rings 1
the 1
jew 1
wanted 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
her 1
history 1
but 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
interest 1
me 1
you 1
were 1
quite 1
right 1
there 1
is 1
always 1
something 1
infinitely 1
mean 1
about 1
other 1
peoples 1
tragedies 1
sibyl 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
i 1
care 1
about 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
where 1
she 1
came 1
from 1
from 1
her 1
little 1
head 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
feet 1
she 1
is 1
absolutely 1
and 1
entirely 1
divine 1
every 1
night 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
go 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
act 1
and 1
every 1
night 1
she 1
is 1
more 1
marvellous 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
never 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
curious 1
romance 1
on 1
hand 1
you 1
have 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
quite 1
what 1
i 1
expected 1
my 1
dear 1
harry 1
we 1
either 1
lunch 1
or 1
sup 1
together 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
with 1
you 1
several 1
times 1
said 1
dorian 1
opening 1
his 1
blue 1
eyes 1
in 1
wonder 1
you 1
always 1
come 1
dreadfully 1
late 1
well 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
sibyl 1
play 1
he 1
cried 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
act 1
i 1
get 1
hungry 1
for 1
her 1
presence 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
soul 1
that 1
is 1
hidden 1
away 1
in 1
that 1
little 1
ivory 1
body 1
i 1
am 1
filled 1
with 1
awe 1
you 1
can 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
tonight 1
dorian 1
cant 1
you 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
tonight 1
she 1
is 1
imogen 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
tomorrow 1
night 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
juliet 1
when 1
is 1
she 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
never 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
how 1
horrid 1
you 1
are 1
she 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
great 1
heroines 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
one 1
she 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
individual 1
you 1
laugh 1
but 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
she 1
has 1
genius 1
i 1
love 1
her 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
make 1
her 1
love 1
me 1
you 1
who 1
know 1
all 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
charm 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
to 1
love 1
me 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
romeo 1
jealous 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
dead 1
lovers 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
hear 1
our 1
laughter 1
and 1
grow 1
sad 1
i 1
want 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
our 1
passion 1
to 1
stir 1
their 1
dust 1
into 1
consciousness 1
to 1
wake 1
their 1
ashes 1
into 1
pain 1
my 1
god 1
harry 1
how 1
i 1
worship 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
hectic 1
spots 1
of 1
red 1
burned 1
on 1
his 1
cheeks 1
he 1
was 1
terribly 1
excited 1
lord 1
henry 1
watched 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
subtle 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
how 1
different 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
shy 1
frightened 1
boy 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
in 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
studio 1
his 1
nature 1
had 1
developed 1
like 1
a 1
flower 1
had 1
borne 1
blossoms 1
of 1
scarlet 1
flame 1
out 1
of 1
its 1
secret 1
hidingplace 1
had 1
crept 1
his 1
soul 1
and 1
desire 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
meet 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
and 1
basil 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
some 1
night 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
act 1
i 1
have 1

not 1
laid 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
horrid 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
sent 1
me 1
my 1
portrait 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
frame 1
specially 1
designed 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
though 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
jealous 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
whole 1
month 1
younger 1
than 1

am 1

him 1

very 1
fond 1
of 1
giving 1
away 1
what 1
they 1
need 1
most 1
themselves 1
it 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
call 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
generosity 1
oh 1
basil 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
fellows 1
but 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
philistine 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
you 1
harry 1

have 1
discovered 1
