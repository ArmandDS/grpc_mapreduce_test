revealed 1
_i 1
love 1
you_ 1
oh 1
you 1
bad 1
thing 1
and 1
she 1
hit 1
his 1
hand 1
a 1
smart 1
rap 1
but 1
reddened 1
and 1
looked 1
pleased 1
nevertheless 1
just 1
at 1
this 1
juncture 1
the 1
boy 1
felt 1
a 1
slow 1
fateful 1
grip 1
closing 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
a 1
steady 1
lifting 1
impulse 1
in 1
that 1
wise 1
he 1
was 1
borne 1
across 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
deposited 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
seat 1
under 1
a 1
peppering 1
fire 1
of 1
giggles 1
from 1
the 1
whole 1
school 1
then 1
the 1
master 1
stood 1
over 1
him 1
during 1
a 1
few 1
awful 1
moments 1
and 1
finally 1
moved 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
throne 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
but 1
although 1
toms 1
ear 1
tingled 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
jubilant 1
as 1
the 1
school 1
quieted 1
down 1
tom 1
made 1
an 1
honest 1
effort 1
to 1
study 1
but 1
the 1
turmoil 1
within 1
him 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
in 1
turn 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
reading 1
class 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
botch 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
geography 1
class 1
and 1
turned 1
lakes 1
into 1
mountains 1
mountains 1
into 1
rivers 1
and 1
rivers 1
into 1
continents 1
till 1
chaos 1
was 1
come 1
again 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
spelling 1
class 1
and 1
got 1
turned 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
mere 1
baby 1
words 1
till 1
he 1
brought 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
and 1
yielded 1
up 1
the 1
pewter 1
medal 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
with 1
ostentation 1
for 1
months 1
chapter 1
vii 1
the 1
harder 1
tom 1
tried 1
to 1
fasten 1
his 1
mind 1
on 1
his 1
book 1
the 1
more 1
his 1
ideas 1
wandered 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
a 1
yawn 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
noon 1
recess 1
would 1
never 1
come 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
utterly 1
dead 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
breath 1
stirring 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
sleepiest 1
of 1
sleepy 1
days 1
the 1
drowsing 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
studying 1
scholars 1
soothed 1
the 1
soul 1
like 1
the 1
spell 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
bees 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
flaming 1
sunshine 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
lifted 1
its 1
soft 1
green 1
sides 1
through 1
a 1
shimmering 1
veil 1
of 1
heat 1
tinted 1
with 1
the 1
purple 1
of 1
distance 1
a 1
few 1
birds 1
floated 1
on 1
lazy 1
wing 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
no 1
other 1
living 1
thing 1
was 1
visible 1
but 1
some 1
cows 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
asleep 1
toms 1
heart 1
ached 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
or 1
else 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
dreary 1
time 1
his 1
hand 1
wandered 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
glow 1
of 1
gratitude 1
that 1
was 1
prayer 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
then 1
furtively 1
the 1
percussioncap 1
box 1
came 1
out 1
he 1
released 1
the 1
tick 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
long 1
flat 1
desk 1
the 1
creature 1
probably 1
glowed 1
with 1
a 1
gratitude 1
that 1
amounted 1
to 1
prayer 1
too 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
premature 1
for 1
when 1
he 1
started 1
thankfully 1
to 1
travel 1
off 1
tom 1
turned 1
him 1
aside 1
with 1
a 1
pin 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
take 1
a 1
new 1
direction 1
toms 1
bosom 1
friend 1
sat 1
next 1
him 1
suffering 1
just 1
as 1
tom 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
and 1
gratefully 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
entertainment 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
this 1
bosom 1
friend 1
was 1
joe 1
harper 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
were 1
sworn 1
friends 1
all 1
the 1
week 1
and 1
embattled 1
enemies 1
on 1
saturdays 1
joe 1
took 1
a 1
pin 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
lapel 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
assist 1
in 1
exercising 1
the 1
prisoner 1
the 1
sport 1
grew 1
in 1
interest 1
momently 1
soon 1
tom 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
interfering 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
neither 1
getting 1
the 1
fullest 1
benefit 1
of 1
the 1
tick 1
so 1
he 1
put 1
joes 1
slate 1
on 1
the 1
desk 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
line 1
down 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
from 1
top 1
to 1
bottom 1
now 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
on 1
your 1
side 1
you 1
can 1
stir 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
ill 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
get 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
youre 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
keep 1
him 1
from 1
crossing 1
over 1
all 1
right 1
go 1
ahead 1
start 1
him 1
up 1
the 1
tick 1
escaped 1
from 1
tom 1
presently 1
and 1
crossed 1
the 1
equator 1
joe 1
harassed 1
him 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
away 1
and 1
crossed 1
back 1
again 1
this 1
change 1
of 1
base 1
occurred 1
often 1
while 1
one 1
boy 1
was 1
worrying 1
the 1
tick 1
with 1
absorbing 1
interest 1
the 1
other 1
would 1
look 1
on 1
with 1
interest 1
as 1
strong 1
the 1
two 1
heads 1
bowed 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
slate 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
souls 1
dead 1
to 1
all 1
things 1
else 1
at 1
last 1
luck 1
seemed 1
to 1
settle 1
and 1
abide 1
with 1
joe 1
the 1
tick 1
tried 1
this 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
course 1
and 1
got 1
as 1
excited 1
and 1
as 1
anxious 1
as 1
the 1
boys 1
themselves 1
but 1
time 1
and 1
again 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
victory 1
in 1
his 1
very 1
grasp 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
toms 1
fingers 1
would 1
be 1
twitching 1
to 1
begin 1
joes 1
pin 1
would 1
deftly 1
head 1
him 1
off 1
and 1
keep 1
possession 1
at 1
last 1
tom 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
the 1
temptation 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
so 1
he 1
reached 1
out 1
and 1
lent 1
a 1
hand 1
with 1
his 1
pin 1
joe 1
was 1
angry 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
said 1
he 1
tom 1
you 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
i 1
only 1
just 1
want 1
to 1

or 1

a 1
tremendous 1
whack 1
came 1
down 1
on 1
toms 1
shoulders 1
and 1
its 1
duplicate 1
on 1
joes 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
two 1
minutes 1
the 1
dust 1
continued 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
two 1
jackets 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
school 1
to 1
enjoy 1
it 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
absorbed 1
to 1
notice 1
the 1
hush 1
that 1
had 1
stolen 1
upon 1
the 1
school 1
awhile 1
before 1
when 1
the 1
master 1
came 1
tiptoeing 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
stood 1
over 1
them 1
he 1
had 1
contemplated 1
a 1
good 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
performance 1
before 1
he 1
contributed 1
his 1
bit 1
of 1
variety 1
to 1
it 1
when 1
school 1
broke 1
up 1
at 1
noon 1
tom 1
flew 1
to 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
her 1
ear 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
bonnet 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
youre 1
going 1
home 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
give 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
em 1
the 1
slip 1
and 1
turn 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
ill 1
go 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
and 1
come 1
it 1
over 1
em 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
so 1
the 1
one 1
went 1
off 1
with 1
one 1
group 1
of 1
scholars 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
another 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
the 1
two 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
school 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
themselves 1
then 1
they 1
sat 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
slate 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
tom 1
gave 1
becky 1
the 1
pencil 1
and 1
held 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
guiding 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
created 1
another 1
surprising 1
house 1
when 1
the 1
interest 1
in 1
art 1
began 1
to 1
wane 1
the 1
two 1
fell 1
to 1
talking 1
tom 1
was 1
swimming 1
in 1
bliss 1
he 1
said 1

so 1
they 1
chewed 1
it 1
turn 1
about 1
and 1
dangled 1
their 1
legs 1
against 1
the 1
bench 1

tom 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
his 1
arm 1
about 1
her 1
neck 1
but 1
she 1
pushed 1
him 1
away 1
and 1
turned 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
crying 1
tom 1
tried 1
again 1
with 1
soothing 1
words 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
was 1
repulsed 1
again 1
then 1
his 1
pride 1
was 1
up 1
and 1
he 1
strode 1
away 1
and 1
went 1
outside 1
he 1
stood 1
about 1
restless 1
and 1
uneasy 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
hoping 1
she 1
would 1
repent 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
then 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
badly 1
and 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
hard 1
struggle 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
new 1
advances 1
now 1
but 1
he 1
nerved 1
himself 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
entered 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
standing 1
back 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
sobbing 1
with 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
toms 1
heart 1
smote 1
him 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
stood 1
a 1
moment 1
not 1
knowing 1
exactly 1
how 1
to 1
proceed 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
hesitatingly 1
becky 1
ii 1

for 1

but 1

sobs 1
beckypleadingly 1
becky 1

sobs 1
tom 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
chiefest 1
jewel 1
a 1
brass 1
knob 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
an 1
andiron 1
and 1
passed 1
it 1
around 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
please 1
becky 1
wont 1
you 1
take 1
it 1
she 1
struck 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
then 1
tom 1
marched 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
school 1
no 1
more 1
that 1
day 1
presently 1
becky 1
began 1
to 1
suspect 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
sight 1
she 1
flew 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
playyard 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
then 1
she 1
called 1
tom 1
come 1
back 1
tom 1
she 1
listened 1
intently 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
companions 1
but 1
silence 1
and 1
loneliness 1
so 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
cry 1
again 1
and 1
upbraid 1
herself 1
and 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
scholars 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
hide 1
her 1
griefs 1
and 1
still 1
her 1
broken 1
heart 1
and 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
cross 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
dreary 1
aching 1
afternoon 1
with 1
none 1
among 1
the 1
strangers 1
about 1
her 1
to 1
exchange 1
sorrows 1
with 1
chapter 1
viii 1
tom 1
dodged 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
through 1
lanes 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
returning 1
scholars 1
and 1
then 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
moody 1
jog 1
he 1
crossed 1
a 1
small 1
branch 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
because 1
of 1
a 1
prevailing 1
juvenile 1
superstition 1
that 1
to 1
cross 1
water 1
baffled 1
pursuit 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
disappearing 1
behind 1
the 1
douglas 1
mansion 1
on 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
cardiff 1
hill 1
and 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
was 1
hardly 1
distinguishable 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
valley 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
entered 1
a 1
dense 1
wood 1
picked 1
his 1
pathless 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
mossy 1
spot 1
under 1
a 1
spreading 1
oak 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
zephyr 1
stirring 1
the 1
dead 1
noonday 1
heat 1
had 1
even 1
stilled 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
nature 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
that 1
was 1
broken 1
by 1
no 1
sound 1
but 1
the 1
occasional 1
faroff 1
hammering 1
of 1
a 1
woodpecker 1
and 1
this 1
seemed 1
to 1
render 1
the 1
pervading 1
silence 1
and 1
sense 1
of 1
loneliness 1
the 1
more 1
profound 1
the 1
boys 1
soul 1
was 1
steeped 1
in 1
melancholy 1
his 1
feelings 1
were 1
in 1
happy 1
accord 1
with 1
his 1
surroundings 1
he 1
sat 1
long 1
with 1
his 1
elbows 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
his 1
chin 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
meditating 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
life 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
trouble 1
at 1
best 1
and 1
he 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
envied 1
jimmy 1
hodges 1
so 1
lately 1
released 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
peaceful 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
lie 1
and 1
slumber 1
and 1
dream 1
forever 1
and 1
ever 1
with 1
the 1
wind 1
whispering 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
caressing 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
over 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
bother 1
and 1
grieve 1
about 1
ever 1
any 1
more 1
if 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
clean 1
sundayschool 1
record 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
willing 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
be 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
all 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
girl 1
what 1
had 1
he 1
done 1
nothing 1
he 1
had 1
meant 1
the 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
been 1
treated 1
like 1
a 1
doglike 1
a 1
very 1
dog 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
sorry 1
some 1
daymaybe 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
ah 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
die 1
_temporarily_ 1
but 1
the 1
elastic 1
heart 1
of 1
youth 1
cannot 1
be 1
compressed 1
into 1
one 1
constrained 1
shape 1
long 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
tom 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
drift 1
insensibly 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
concerns 1
of 1
this 1
life 1
again 1
what 1
if 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
now 1
and 1
disappeared 1
mysteriously 1
what 1
if 1
he 1
went 1
awayever 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
into 1
unknown 1
countries 1
beyond 1
the 1
seasand 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
any 1
more 1
how 1
would 1
she 1
feel 1
then 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
clown 1
recurred 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
only 1
to 1
fill 1
him 1
with 1
disgust 1
for 1
frivolity 1
and 1
jokes 1
and 1
spotted 1
tights 1
were 1
an 1
offense 1
when 1
they 1
intruded 1
themselves 1
upon 1
a 1
spirit 1
that 1
was 1
exalted 1
into 1
the 1
vague 1
august 1
realm 1
of 1
the 1
romantic 1
no 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
soldier 1
and 1
return 1
after 1
long 1
years 1
all 1
warworn 1
and 1
illustrious 1
nobetter 1
still 1
he 1
would 1
join 1
the 1
indians 1
and 1
hunt 1
buffaloes 1
and 1
go 1
on 1
the 1
warpath 1
in 1
the 1
mountain 1
ranges 1
and 1
the 1
trackless 1
great 1
plains 1
of 1
the 1
far 1
west 1
and 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
come 1
back 1
a 1
great 1
chief 1
bristling 1
with 1
feathers 1
hideous 1
with 1
paint 1
and 1
prance 1
into 1
sundayschool 1
some 1
drowsy 1
summer 1
morning 1
with 1
a 1
bloodcurdling 1
warwhoop 1
and 1
sear 1
the 1
eyeballs 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
companions 1
with 1
unappeasable 1
envy 1
but 1
no 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
gaudier 1
even 1
than 1
this 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
_now_ 1
his 1
future 1
lay 1
plain 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
glowing 1
with 1
unimaginable 1
splendor 1
how 1
his 1
name 1
would 1
fill 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
make 1
people 1
shudder 1
how 1
gloriously 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
plowing 1
the 1
dancing 1
seas 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
low 1
blackhulled 1
racer 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
storm 1
with 1
his 1
grisly 1
flag 1
flying 1
at 1
the 1
fore 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
zenith 1
of 1
his 1
fame 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
suddenly 1
appear 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
village 1
and 1
stalk 1
into 1
church 1
brown 1
and 1
weatherbeaten 1
in 1
his 1
black 1
velvet 1
doublet 1
and 1
trunks 1
his 1
great 1
jackboots 1
his 1
crimson 1
sash 1
his 1
belt 1
bristling 1
with 1
horsepistols 1
his 1
crimerusted 1
cutlass 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
his 1
slouch 1
hat 1
with 1
waving 1
plumes 1
his 1
black 1
flag 1
unfurled 1
with 1
the 1
skull 1
and 1
crossbones 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
hear 1
with 1
swelling 1
ecstasy 1
the 1
whisperings 1
its 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
the 1
piratethe 1
black 1
avenger 1
of 1
the 1
spanish 1
main 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
his 1
career 1
was 1
determined 1
he 1
would 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
enter 1
upon 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
start 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
morning 1
therefore 1
he 1
must 1
now 1
begin 1
to 1
get 1
ready 1
he 1
would 1
collect 1
his 1
resources 1
together 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
rotten 1
log 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
under 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
barlow 1
knife 1
he 1
soon 1
struck 1
wood 1
that 1
sounded 1
hollow 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
there 1
and 1
uttered 1
this 1
incantation 1
impressively 1
what 1
hasnt 1
come 1
here 1
come 1
whats 1
here 1
stay 1
here 1
then 1
he 1
scraped 1
away 1
the 1
dirt 1
and 1
exposed 1
a 1
pine 1
shingle 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
disclosed 1
a 1
shapely 1
little 1
treasurehouse 1
whose 1
bottom 1
and 1
sides 1
were 1
of 1
shingles 1
in 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
marble 1
toms 1
astonishment 1
was 1
boundless 1
he 1
scratched 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
perplexed 1
air 1
and 1
said 1
well 1
that 1
beats 1
anything 1
then 1
he 1
tossed 1
the 1
marble 1
away 1
pettishly 1
and 1
stood 1
cogitating 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
that 1
a 1
superstition 1
of 1
his 1
had 1
failed 1
here 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
comrades 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
infallible 1
if 1
you 1
buried 1
a 1
marble 1
with 1
certain 1
necessary 1
incantations 1
and 1
left 1
it 1
alone 1
a 1
fortnight 1
and 1
then 1
opened 1
the 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
incantation 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
used 1
you 1
would 1
find 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
marbles 1
you 1
had 1
ever 1
lost 1
had 1
gathered 1
themselves 1
together 1
there 1
meantime 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
widely 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
separated 1
but 1
now 1
this 1
thing 1
had 1
actually 1
and 1
unquestionably 1
failed 1
toms 1
whole 1
structure 1
of 1
faith 1
was 1
shaken 1
to 1
its 1
foundations 1
he 1
had 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
thing 1
succeeding 1
but 1
never 1
of 1
its 1
failing 1
before 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
it 1
several 1
times 1
before 1
himself 1
but 1
could 1
never 1
find 1
the 1
hidingplaces 1
afterward 1
he 1
puzzled 1
over 1
the 1
matter 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
finally 1
decided 1
that 1
some 1
witch 1
had 1
interfered 1
and 1
broken 1
the 1
charm 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
satisfy 1
himself 1
on 1
that 1
point 1
so 1
he 1
searched 1
around 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
small 1
sandy 1
spot 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
funnelshaped 1
depression 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
mouth 1
close 1
to 1
this 1
depression 1
and 1
called 1
doodlebug 1
doodlebug 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
doodlebug 1
doodlebug 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
sand 1
began 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
presently 1
a 1
small 1
black 1
bug 1
appeared 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
then 1
darted 1
under 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
fright 1
he 1
dasnt 1
tell 1
so 1
it 1
_was_ 1
a 1
witch 1
that 1
done 1
it 1
i 1
just 1
knowed 1
it 1
he 1
well 1
knew 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
contend 1
against 1
witches 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
up 1
discouraged 1
but 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
have 1
the 1
marble 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
thrown 1
away 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
went 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
patient 1
search 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
now 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
treasurehouse 1
and 1
carefully 1
placed 1
himself 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
standing 1
when 1
he 1
tossed 1
the 1
marble 1
away 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
marble 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
tossed 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
saying 1
brother 1
go 1
find 1
your 1
brother 1
he 1
watched 1
where 1
it 1
stopped 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
looked 1
but 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
fallen 1
short 1
or 1
gone 1
too 1
far 1
so 1
he 1
tried 1
twice 1
more 1
the 1
last 1
repetition 1
was 1
successful 1
the 1
two 1
marbles 1
lay 1
within 1
a 1
foot 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
just 1
here 1
the 1
blast 1
of 1
a 1
toy 1
tin 1
trumpet 1
came 1
faintly 1
down 1
the 1
green 1
aisles 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
tom 1
flung 1
off 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
trousers 1
turned 1
a 1
suspender 1
into 1
a 1
belt 1
raked 1
away 1
some 1
brush 1
behind 1
the 1
rotten 1
log 1
disclosing 1
a 1
rude 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
a 1
lath 1
sword 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
trumpet 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
had 1
seized 1
these 1
things 1
and 1
bounded 1
away 1
barelegged 1
with 1
fluttering 1
shirt 1
he 1
presently 1
halted 1
under 1
a 1
great 1
elm 1
blew 1
an 1
answering 1
blast 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
to 1
tiptoe 1
and 1
look 1
warily 1
out 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
cautiouslyto 1
an 1
imaginary 1
company 1
hold 1
my 1
merry 1
men 1
keep 1
hid 1
till 1
i 1

now 1
appeared 1
joe 1
harper 1
as 1
airily 1
clad 1
and 1
elaborately 1
armed 1
as 1
tom 1
tom 1
called 1

tom 1
promptingfor 1

by 1
the 1
book 1
from 1
memory 1

they 1
took 1
their 1
lath 1
swords 1
dumped 1
their 1
other 1
traps 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
struck 1
a 1
fencing 1
attitude 1
foot 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
grave 1
careful 1
combat 1
two 1
up 1
and 1
two 1
down 1
presently 1
tom 1
said 1
now 1
if 1
youve 1
got 1
the 1
hang 1
go 1
it 1
lively 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
it 1
lively 1
panting 1
and 1
perspiring 1
with 1
the 1
work 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
tom 1
shouted 1
fall 1
fall 1

the 1
way 1
it 1

in 1
the 1
book 1
the 1
book 1

with 1
one 1
backhanded 1
stroke 1
he 1
slew 1

guisborne 1

to 1

around 1
and 1

me 1
hit 1

in 1
the 1
back 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
the 1
authorities 1
so 1
joe 1
turned 1
received 1
the 1
whack 1
and 1
fell 1
now 1
said 1
joe 1
getting 1
up 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
kill 1
_you_ 1
thats 1

joe 1

millers 1

and 1
lam 1

a 1
quarterstaff 1
or 1
ill 1
be 1
the 1
sheriff 1
of 1
nottingham 1
and 1
you 1
be 1
robin 1
hood 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
kill 1
me 1
this 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
so 1
these 1
adventures 1
were 1
carried 1
out 1
then 1
tom 1
became 1
robin 1
hood 1
again 1
and 1
was 1
allowed 1
by 1
the 1
treacherous 1
nun 1
to 1
bleed 1
his 1
strength 1
away 1
through 1
his 1
neglected 1
wound 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
joe 1
representing 1
a 1
whole 1
tribe 1
of 1
weeping 1
outlaws 1
dragged 1
him 1
sadly 1
forth 1
gave 1
his 1
bow 1
into 1
his 1
feeble 1
hands 1
and 1
tom 1
said 1
where 1
this 1
arrow 1
falls 1
there 1
bury 1
poor 1
robin 1
hood 1
under 1
the 1
greenwood 1
tree 1
then 1
he 1
shot 1
the 1
arrow 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
died 1
but 1
he 1
lit 1
on 1
a 1
nettle 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
too 1
gaily 1
for 1
a 1
corpse 1
the 1
boys 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
hid 1
their 1
accoutrements 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
grieving 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
outlaws 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
modern 1
civilization 1
could 1
claim 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
compensate 1
for 1
their 1
loss 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
rather 1
be 1
outlaws 1
a 1
year 1
in 1
sherwood 1
forest 1
than 1
president 1
of 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
forever 1
chapter 1
ix 1
at 1
halfpast 1
nine 1
that 1
night 1
tom 1
and 1
sid 1
were 1
sent 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
usual 1
they 1
said 1
their 1
prayers 1
and 1
sid 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
tom 1
lay 1
awake 1
and 1
waited 1
in 1
restless 1
impatience 1
when 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
nearly 1
daylight 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
strike 1
ten 1
this 1
was 1
despair 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
tossed 1
and 1
fidgeted 1
as 1
his 1
nerves 1
demanded 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
he 1
might 1
wake 1
sid 1
so 1
he 1
lay 1
still 1
and 1
stared 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
everything 1
was 1
dismally 1
still 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
stillness 1
little 1
scarcely 1
perceptible 1
noises 1
began 1
to 1
emphasize 1
themselves 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
began 1
to 1
bring 1
itself 1
into 1
notice 1
old 1
beams 1
began 1
to 1
crack 1
mysteriously 1
the 1
stairs 1
creaked 1
faintly 1
evidently 1
spirits 1
were 1
abroad 1
a 1
measured 1
muffled 1
snore 1
issued 1
from 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
chamber 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
tiresome 1
chirping 1
of 1
a 1
cricket 1
that 1
no 1
human 1
ingenuity 1
could 1
locate 1
began 1
next 1
the 1
ghastly 1
ticking 1
of 1
a 1
deathwatch 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
beds 1
head 1
made 1
tom 1
shudderit 1
meant 1
that 1
somebodys 1
days 1
were 1
numbered 1
then 1
the 1
howl 1
of 1
a 1
faroff 1
dog 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
and 1
was 1
answered 1
by 1
a 1
fainter 1
howl 1
from 1
a 1
remoter 1
distance 1
tom 1
was 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
that 1
time 1
had 1
ceased 1
and 1
eternity 1
begun 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
doze 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
the 1
clock 1
chimed 1
eleven 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
mingling 1
with 1
his 1
halfformed 1
dreams 1
a 1
most 1
melancholy 1
caterwauling 1
the 1
raising 1
of 1
a 1
neighboring 1
window 1
disturbed 1
him 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
scat 1
you 1
devil 1
and 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
an 1
empty 1
bottle 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
aunts 1
woodshed 1
brought 1
him 1
wide 1
awake 1
and 1
a 1
single 1
minute 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
creeping 1
along 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
ell 1
on 1
all 1
fours 1
he 1
meowd 1
with 1
caution 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
then 1
jumped 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
woodshed 1
and 1
thence 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
huckleberry 1
finn 1
was 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
dead 1
cat 1
the 1
boys 1
moved 1
off 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
they 1
were 1
wading 1
through 1
the 1
tall 1
grass 1
of 1
the 1
graveyard 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
graveyard 1
of 1
the 1
oldfashioned 1
western 1
kind 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
hill 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
crazy 1
board 1
fence 1
around 1
it 1
which 1
leaned 1
inward 1
in 1
places 1
and 1
outward 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
stood 1
upright 1
nowhere 1
grass 1
and 1
weeds 1
grew 1
rank 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
cemetery 1
all 1
the 1
old 1
graves 1
were 1
sunken 1
in 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
tombstone 1
on 1
the 1
place 1
roundtopped 1
wormeaten 1
boards 1
staggered 1
over 1
the 1
graves 1
leaning 1
for 1
support 1
and 1
finding 1
none 1
sacred 1
to 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
soandso 1
had 1
been 1
painted 1
on 1
them 1
once 1
but 1
it 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
been 1
read 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
now 1
even 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
light 1
a 1
faint 1
wind 1
moaned 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
tom 1
feared 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
complaining 1
at 1
being 1
disturbed 1
the 1
boys 1
talked 1
little 1
and 1
only 1
under 1
their 1
breath 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
the 1
pervading 1
solemnity 1
and 1
silence 1
oppressed 1
their 1
spirits 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
sharp 1
new 1
heap 1
they 1
were 1
seeking 1
and 1
ensconced 1
themselves 1
within 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
three 1
great 1
elms 1
that 1
grew 1
in 1
a 1
bunch 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
then 1
they 1
waited 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
hooting 1
of 1
a 1
distant 1
owl 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
sound 1
that 1
troubled 1
the 1
dead 1
stillness 1
toms 1
reflections 1
grew 1
oppressive 1
he 1
must 1
force 1
some 1
talk 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
whisper 1
hucky 1
do 1
you 1
believe 1
the 1
dead 1
people 1
like 1

solemn 1
like 1
_aint_ 1
it 1
i 1

there 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
pause 1
while 1
the 1
boys 1
canvassed 1
this 1
matter 1
inwardly 1
then 1
tom 1
whispered 1
say 1

dead 1

tom 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
damper 1
and 1
conversation 1
died 1
again 1
presently 1
tom 1
seized 1
his 1
comrades 1
arm 1
and 1
said 1
sh 1
what 1
is 1

the 1

bent 1
their 1
heads 1
together 1
and 1
scarcely 1
breathed 1
a 1
muffled 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
floated 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
graveyard 1
look 1

whispered 1
tom 1

some 1
vague 1

through 1
the 1
gloom 1
swinging 1
an 1
oldfashioned 1
tin 1
lantern 1
that 1
freckled 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
innumerable 1
little 1
spangles 1
of 1
light 1
presently 1
huckleberry 1
whispered 1

kin 1
they 1
be 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
whisper 1
died 1
wholly 1
out 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
men 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
stood 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
hidingplace 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
the 1
third 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
held 1
the 1
lantern 1
up 1
and 1
revealed 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
young 1
doctor 1
robinson 1
potter 1
and 1
injun 1
joe 1
were 1
carrying 1
a 1
handbarrow 1
with 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
shovels 1
on 1
it 1
they 1
cast 1
down 1
their 1
load 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
grave 1
the 1
doctor 1
put 1
the 1
lantern 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
came 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
against 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
elm 1
trees 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
close 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
have 1
touched 1
him 1
hurry 1
men 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
the 1
moon 1
might 1
come 1
out 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
they 1
growled 1
a 1
response 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
digging 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
noise 1
but 1
the 1
grating 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
spades 1
discharging 1
their 1
freight 1
of 1
mould 1
and 1
gravel 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
monotonous 1
finally 1
a 1
spade 1
struck 1
upon 1
the 1
coffin 1
with 1
a 1
dull 1
woody 1
accent 1
and 1
within 1
another 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
hoisted 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
they 1
pried 1
off 1
the 1
lid 1
with 1
their 1
shovels 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
dumped 1
it 1
rudely 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
moon 1
drifted 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
clouds 1
and 1
exposed 1
the 1
pallid 1
face 1
the 1
barrow 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
corpse 1
placed 1
on 1
it 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
blanket 1
and 1
bound 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
rope 1
potter 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
large 1
springknife 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
dangling 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
then 1
said 1

cussed 1

the 1
doctor 1

and 1

than 1

said 1
injun 1
joe 1
approaching 1
the 1
doctor 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
standing 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
you 1
drove 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
your 1
fathers 1
kitchen 1
one 1
night 1
when 1

and 1

when 1

a 1
hundred 1
years 1
your 1
father 1

me 1
jailed 1
for 1

vagrant 1

and 1
now 1

_got_ 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
_settle_ 1
you 1
know 1
he 1
was 1
threatening 1
the 1
doctor 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
doctor 1
struck 1
out 1
suddenly 1
and 1
stretched 1
the 1
ruffian 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
potter 1
dropped 1
his 1
knife 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
here 1
now 1
dont 1
you 1
hit 1
my 1
pard 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
grappled 1
with 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
were 1
struggling 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
trampling 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
their 1
heels 1
injun 1
joe 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
his 1
eyes 1
flaming 1
with 1
passion 1
snatched 1
up 1
potters 1
knife 1
and 1
went 1
creeping 1
catlike 1
and 1
stooping 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
combatants 1
seeking 1
an 1
opportunity 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
doctor 1
flung 1
himself 1
free 1
seized 1
the 1
heavy 1
headboard 1
of 1
williams 1
grave 1
and 1
felled 1
potter 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
with 1
itand 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
the 1
halfbreed 1
saw 1
his 1
chance 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
knife 1
to 1
the 1
hilt 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
mans 1
breast 1
he 1
reeled 1
and 1
fell 1
partly 1
upon 1
potter 1
flooding 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
blood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
the 1
clouds 1
blotted 1
out 1
the 1
dreadful 1
spectacle 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
frightened 1
boys 1
went 1
speeding 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
presently 1
when 1
the 1
moon 1
emerged 1
again 1
injun 1
joe 1
was 1
standing 1
over 1
the 1
two 1
forms 1
contemplating 1
them 1
the 1
doctor 1
murmured 1
inarticulately 1
gave 1
a 1
long 1
gasp 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
the 1
halfbreed 1
muttered 1
_that_ 1
score 1
is 1
settleddamn 1
you 1
then 1
he 1
robbed 1
the 1
body 1
after 1
which 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
fatal 1
knife 1
in 1
potters 1
open 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
dismantled 1
coffin 1
threefourfive 1
minutes 1
passed 1
and 1
then 1
potter 1
began 1
to 1
stir 1
and 1
moan 1
his 1
hand 1
closed 1
upon 1
the 1
knife 1
he 1
raised 1
it 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
let 1
it 1
fall 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
then 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
pushing 1
the 1
body 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
around 1
him 1
confusedly 1
his 1
eyes 1
met 1
joes 1
lord 1
how 1
is 1

joe 1
he 1
said 1
its 1

the 1

stolid 1
murderer 1
and 1
clasped 1
his 1
appealing 1
hands 1

to 1
cry 1

of 1
that 1

tracks 1
behind 1
you 1
potter 1
started 1
on 1
a 1
trot 1
that 1
quickly 1
increased 1
to 1
a 1
run 1
the 1
halfbreed 1
stood 1
looking 1
after 1
him 1
he 1
muttered 1
if 1
hes 1
as 1
much 1
stunned 1
with 1
the 1
lick 1
and 1
fuddled 1
with 1
the 1
rum 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
being 1
he 1
wont 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
knife 1
till 1
hes 1
gone 1
so 1
far 1
hell 1
be 1
afraid 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
after 1
it 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
by 1
himselfchickenheart 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
later 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
the 1
blanketed 1
corpse 1
the 1
lidless 1
coffin 1
and 1
the 1
open 1
grave 1
were 1
under 1
no 1
inspection 1
but 1
the 1
moons 1
the 1
stillness 1
was 1
complete 1
again 1
too 1
chapter 1
x 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
flew 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
toward 1
the 1
village 1
speechless 1
with 1
horror 1
they 1
glanced 1
backward 1
over 1
their 1
shoulders 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
apprehensively 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
feared 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
every 1
stump 1
that 1
started 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
path 1
seemed 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
an 1
enemy 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
catch 1
their 1
breath 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
sped 1
by 1
some 1
outlying 1
cottages 1
that 1
lay 1
near 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
barking 1
of 1
the 1
aroused 1
watchdogs 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
wings 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
tannery 1
before 1
we 1
break 1
down 1
whispered 1
tom 1
in 1
short 1
catches 1
between 1
breaths 1
i 1
cant 1
stand 1
it 1
much 1
longer 1
huckleberrys 1
hard 1
pantings 1
were 1
his 1
only 1
reply 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
fixed 1
their 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
goal 1
of 1
their 1
hopes 1
and 1
bent 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
to 1
win 1
it 1
they 1
gained 1
steadily 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
breast 1
to 1
breast 1
they 1
burst 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
fell 1
grateful 1
and 1
exhausted 1
in 1
the 1
sheltering 1
shadows 1
beyond 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
their 1
pulses 1
slowed 1
down 1
and 1
tom 1
whispered 1
huckleberry 1
what 1

reckonll 1
come 1
of 1

thought 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
he 1
said 1

on 1
thinking 1
presently 1
he 1
whispered 1

and 1
besides 1
he 1

toms 1
whole 1
being 1
applauded 1
this 1
idea 1
it 1
was 1
deep 1
and 1
dark 1
and 1
awful 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
circumstances 1
the 1
surroundings 1
were 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
it 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
clean 1
pine 1
shingle 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
took 1
a 1
little 1
fragment 1
of 1
red 1
keel 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
got 1
the 1
moon 1
on 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
painfully 1
scrawled 1
these 1
lines 1
emphasizing 1
each 1
slow 1
downstroke 1
by 1
clamping 1
his 1
tongue 1
between 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
letting 1
up 1
the 1
pressure 1
on 1
the 1
upstrokes 1

huck 1
finn 1
and 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
swears 1
they 1
will 1
keep 1
mum 1
about 1
this 1
and 1
they 1
wish 1
they 1
may 1
drop 1
down 1
dead 1
in 1
their 1
tracks 1
if 1
they 1
ever 1
tell 1
and 1
rot 1
huckleberry 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
admiration 1
of 1
toms 1
facility 1
in 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
sublimity 1
of 1
his 1
language 1
he 1
at 1
once 1
took 1
a 1
pin 1
from 1
his 1
lapel 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
prick 1
his 1
flesh 1
but 1
tom 1
said 1
hold 1
on 1
dont 1
do 1
that 1
a 1
pins 1

onceyoull 1
see 1
so 1
tom 1
unwound 1
the 1
thread 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
needles 1
and 1
each 1
boy 1
pricked 1
the 1
ball 1
of 1
his 1
thumb 1
and 1
squeezed 1
out 1
a 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
in 1
time 1
after 1
many 1
squeezes 1
tom 1
managed 1
to 1
sign 1
his 1
initials 1
using 1
the 1
ball 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
finger 1
for 1
a 1
pen 1
then 1
he 1
showed 1
huckleberry 1
how 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
h 1
and 1
an 1
f 1
and 1
the 1
oath 1
was 1
complete 1
they 1
buried 1
the 1
shingle 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
some 1
dismal 1
ceremonies 1
and 1
incantations 1
and 1
the 1
fetters 1
that 1
bound 1
their 1
tongues 1
were 1
considered 1
to 1
be 1
locked 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
thrown 1
away 1
a 1
figure 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
through 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
ruined 1
building 1
now 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
notice 1
it 1
tom 1
whispered 1
huckleberry 1

so 1
they 1
continued 1
to 1
whisper 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
presently 1
a 1
dog 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
lugubrious 1
howl 1
just 1
outsidewithin 1
ten 1
feet 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
boys 1
clasped 1
each 1
other 1
suddenly 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
fright 1
which 1

with 1
fear 1
yielded 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
eye 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
his 1
whisper 1
was 1
hardly 1
audible 1
when 1
he 1
said 1

whispered 1

long 1
with 1

hogs 1

laws 1

just 1

reckon 1
he 1
aint 1
ever 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
this 1
town 1
any 1
more 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
adventure 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
boys 1
souls 1
once 1
more 1
hucky 1
do 1
you 1
dast 1
to 1
go 1

like 1
to 1
much 1
tom 1
spose 1
its 1
injun 1
joe 1
tom 1
quailed 1
but 1
presently 1
the 1
temptation 1
rose 1
up 1
strong 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
agreed 1
to 1
try 1
with 1
the 1
understanding 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
to 1
their 1
heels 1
if 1
the 1
snoring 1
stopped 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
tiptoeing 1
stealthily 1
down 1
the 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
to 1
within 1
five 1
steps 1
of 1
the 1
snorer 1
tom 1
stepped 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
it 1
broke 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
snap 1
the 1
man 1
moaned 1
writhed 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
moonlight 1
it 1
was 1
muff 1
potter 1
the 1
boys 1
hearts 1
had 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
their 1
hopes 1
too 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
moved 1
but 1
their 1
fears 1
passed 1
away 1
now 1
they 1
tiptoed 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
broken 1
weatherboarding 1
and 1
stopped 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
distance 1
to 1
exchange 1
a 1
parting 1
word 1
that 1
long 1
lugubrious 1
howl 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
again 1
they 1
turned 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
strange 1
dog 1
standing 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
where 1
potter 1
was 1
lying 1
and 1
_facing_ 1
potter 1
with 1
his 1
nose 1
pointing 1
heavenward 1
oh 1
geeminy 1
its 1
_him_ 1
exclaimed 1
both 1
boys 1
in 1
a 1
breath 1
say 1

say 1

stray 1
dog 1
come 1
howling 1
around 1

much 1
as 1
two 1
weeks 1
ago 1
and 1
a 1
whippoorwill 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
the 1
banisters 1
and 1
sung 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
evening 1
and 1
there 1
aint 1
anybody 1

yet 1
well 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
and 1
suppose 1

kitchen 1

and 1

terrible 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
saturday 1
yes 1
but 1
she 1

and 1

thats 1
what 1
the 1
niggers 1
say 1
and 1
they 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
these 1
kind 1
of 1
things 1
huck 1
then 1
they 1
separated 1
cogitating 1
when 1
tom 1
crept 1
in 1
at 1
his 1
bedroom 1
window 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
almost 1
spent 1
he 1
undressed 1
with 1
excessive 1
caution 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
congratulating 1
himself 1
that 1
nobody 1
knew 1
of 1
his 1
escapade 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
the 1
gentlysnoring 1
sid 1
was 1
awake 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
when 1
tom 1
awoke 1
sid 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
gone 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
late 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
a 1
late 1
sense 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
he 1
was 1
startled 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
been 1
calledpersecuted 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
as 1
usual 1
the 1
thought 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
bodings 1
within 1
five 1
minutes 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
downstairs 1
feeling 1
sore 1
and 1
drowsy 1
the 1
family 1
were 1
still 1
at 1
table 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
finished 1
breakfast 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
voice 1
of 1
rebuke 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
averted 1
eyes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
silence 1
and 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
solemnity 1
that 1
struck 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
the 1
culprits 1
heart 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
seem 1
gay 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
uphill 1
work 1
it 1
roused 1
no 1
smile 1
no 1
response 1
and 1
he 1
lapsed 1
into 1
silence 1
and 1
let 1
his 1
heart 1
sink 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
depths 1
after 1
breakfast 1
his 1
aunt 1
took 1
him 1
aside 1
and 1
tom 1
almost 1
brightened 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
flogged 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
his 1
aunt 1
wept 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
and 1
break 1
her 1
old 1
heart 1
so 1
and 1
finally 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
ruin 1
himself 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1
gray 1
hairs 1
with 1
sorrow 1
to 1
the 1
grave 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
try 1
any 1
more 1
this 1
was 1
worse 1
than 1
a 1
thousand 1
whippings 1
and 1
toms 1
heart 1
was 1
sorer 1
now 1
than 1
his 1
body 1
he 1
cried 1
he 1
pleaded 1
for 1
forgiveness 1
promised 1
to 1
reform 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
received 1
his 1
dismissal 1
feeling 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
won 1
but 1
an 1
imperfect 1
forgiveness 1
and 1
established 1
but 1
a 1
feeble 1
confidence 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
presence 1
too 1
miserable 1
to 1
even 1
feel 1
revengeful 1
toward 1
sid 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
latters 1
prompt 1
retreat 1
through 1
the 1
back 1
gate 1
was 1
unnecessary 1
he 1
moped 1
to 1
school 1
gloomy 1
and 1
sad 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
flogging 1
along 1
with 1
joe 1
harper 1
for 1
playing 1
hookey 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
one 1
whose 1
heart 1
was 1
busy 1
with 1
heavier 1
woes 1
and 1
wholly 1
dead 1
to 1
trifles 1
then 1
he 1
betook 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
rested 1
his 1
elbows 1
on 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
his 1
jaws 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
the 1
stony 1
stare 1
of 1
suffering 1
that 1
has 1
reached 1
the 1
limit 1
and 1
can 1
no 1
further 1
go 1
his 1
elbow 1
was 1
pressing 1
against 1
some 1
hard 1
substance 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
slowly 1
and 1
sadly 1
changed 1
his 1
position 1
and 1
took 1
up 1
this 1
object 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
paper 1
he 1
unrolled 1
it 1
a 1
long 1
lingering 1
colossal 1
sigh 1
followed 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
broke 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
brass 1
andiron 1
knob 1
this 1
final 1
feather 1
broke 1
the 1
camels 1
back 1
chapter 1
xi 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
noon 1
the 1
whole 1
village 1
was 1
suddenly 1
electrified 1
with 1
the 1
ghastly 1
news 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
the 1
as 1
yet 1
undreamedof 1

the 1
tale 1
flew 1
from 1

to 1
man 1
from 1
group 1
to 1

from 1
house 1
to 1

the 1
schoolmaster 1
gave 1
holiday 1
for 1
that 1
afternoon 1
the 1
town 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
strangely 1
of 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
gory 1
knife 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
recognized 1
by 1
somebody 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
muff 1
potterso 1
the 1
story 1
ran 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
a 1
belated 1
citizen 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
potter 1
washing 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
branch 1
about 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
that 1
potter 1
had 1
at 1
once 1
sneaked 1
offsuspicious 1
circumstances 1
especially 1
the 1
washing 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
habit 1
with 1
potter 1
it 1
was 1
also 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
town 1
had 1
been 1
ransacked 1
for 1
this 1
murderer 1
the 1
public 1
are 1
not 1
slow 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
sifting 1
evidence 1
and 1
arriving 1
at 1
a 1
verdict 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
found 1
horsemen 1
had 1
departed 1
down 1
all 1
the 1
roads 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
and 1
the 1
sheriff 1
was 1
confident 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
captured 1
before 1
night 1
all 1
the 1
town 1
was 1
drifting 1
toward 1
the 1
graveyard 1
toms 1
heartbreak 1
vanished 1
and 1
he 1
joined 1
the 1
procession 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
rather 1
go 1
anywhere 1
else 1
but 1
because 1
an 1
awful 1
unaccountable 1
fascination 1
drew 1
him 1
on 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
dreadful 1
place 1
he 1
wormed 1
his 1
small 1
body 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
dismal 1
spectacle 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
age 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
before 1
somebody 1
pinched 1
his 1
arm 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
met 1
huckleberrys 1
then 1
both 1
looked 1
elsewhere 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
anybody 1
had 1
noticed 1
anything 1
in 1
their 1
mutual 1
glance 1
but 1
everybody 1
was 1
talking 1
and 1
intent 1
upon 1
the 1
grisly 1
spectacle 1
before 1
them 1
poor 1
fellow 1
poor 1
young 1
fellow 1
this 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
lesson 1
to 1
grave 1
robbers 1
muff 1
potterll 1
hang 1
for 1
this 1
if 1
they 1
catch 1
him 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
drift 1
of 1
remark 1
and 1
the 1
minister 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
judgment 1
his 1
hand 1
is 1
here 1
now 1
tom 1
shivered 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
heel 1
for 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
stolid 1
face 1
of 1
injun 1
joe 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
the 1
crowd 1
began 1
to 1
sway 1
and 1
struggle 1
and 1
voices 1
shouted 1
its 1

he 1

only 1

doubtful 1
and 1
perplexed 1
infernal 1
impudence 1
said 1
a 1
bystander 1

to 1
come 1
and 1

a 1
quiet 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
work 1
i 1
reckondidnt 1
expect 1
any 1
company 1
the 1
crowd 1
fell 1
apart 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
sheriff 1
came 1
through 1
ostentatiously 1
leading 1
potter 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
the 1
poor 1
fellows 1
face 1
was 1
haggard 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
showed 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
was 1
upon 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
he 1
shook 1
as 1
with 1
a 1
palsy 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
i 1
didnt 1
do 1
it 1

he 1
sobbed 1
pon 1
my 1
word 1
and 1
honor 1
i 1
never 1
done 1
it 1
whos 1
accused 1
you 1
shouted 1
a 1
voice 1
this 1
shot 1
seemed 1
to 1
carry 1
home 1
potter 1
lifted 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
pathetic 1
hopelessness 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
saw 1
injun 1
joe 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
oh 1
injun 1
joe 1
you 1
promised 1
me 1
youd 1
never 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
knife 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
thrust 1
before 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
sheriff 1
potter 1
would 1
have 1
fallen 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
eased 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
something 1
told 1
me 1
t 1
if 1
i 1
didnt 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
get 1
he 1
shuddered 1
then 1
waved 1
his 1
nerveless 1
hand 1
with 1
a 1
vanquished 1
gesture 1
and 1
said 1
tell 1
em 1
joe 1
tell 1
emit 1
aint 1
any 1
use 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
huckleberry 1
and 1
tom 1
stood 1
dumb 1
and 1
staring 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
stonyhearted 1
liar 1
reel 1
off 1
his 1
serene 1
statement 1
they 1
expecting 1
every 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
clear 1
sky 1
would 1
deliver 1
gods 1
lightnings 1
upon 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
wondering 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
long 1
the 1
stroke 1
was 1
delayed 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
and 1
still 1
stood 1
alive 1
and 1
whole 1
their 1
wavering 1
impulse 1
to 1
break 1
their 1
oath 1
and 1
save 1
the 1
poor 1
betrayed 1
prisoners 1
life 1
faded 1
and 1
vanished 1
away 1
for 1
plainly 1
this 1
miscreant 1
had 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
satan 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
to 1
meddle 1
with 1
the 1
property 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
power 1
as 1
that 1
why 1
didnt 1
you 1
leave 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
here 1
for 1
somebody 1
said 1
i 1

potter 1
moaned 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
i 1
couldnt 1
seem 1
to 1
come 1
anywhere 1
but 1
here 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
to 1
sobbing 1
again 1
injun 1
joe 1
repeated 1
his 1
statement 1
just 1
as 1
calmly 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
afterward 1
on 1
the 1
inquest 1
under 1
oath 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
seeing 1
that 1
the 1
lightnings 1
were 1
still 1
withheld 1
were 1
confirmed 1
in 1
their 1
belief 1
that 1
joe 1
had 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
devil 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
become 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
most 1
balefully 1
interesting 1
object 1
they 1
had 1
ever 1
looked 1
upon 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
their 1
fascinated 1
eyes 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
they 1
inwardly 1
resolved 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
nights 1
when 1
opportunity 1
should 1
offer 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
getting 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
his 1
dread 1
master 1
injun 1
joe 1
helped 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
wagon 1
for 1
removal 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
whispered 1
through 1
the 1
shuddering 1
crowd 1
that 1
the 1
wound 1
bled 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
boys 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
happy 1
circumstance 1
would 1
turn 1
suspicion 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
direction 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
disappointed 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
villager 1
remarked 1
it 1
was 1
within 1
three 1
feet 1
of 1
muff 1
potter 1
when 1
it 1
done 1
it 1
toms 1
fearful 1
secret 1
and 1
gnawing 1
conscience 1
disturbed 1
his 1
sleep 1
for 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
week 1
after 1
this 1
and 1
at 1
breakfast 1
one 1
morning 1
sid 1
said 1
tom 1
you 1
pitch 1
around 1
and 1
talk 1
in 1
your 1
sleep 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
you 1
keep 1
me 1
awake 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
tom 1
blanched 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
eyes 1
its 1
a 1
bad 1
sign 1
said 1
aunt 1
polly 1
gravely 1
what 1
you 1
got 1
on 1
your 1
mind 1
tom 1
nothing 1
nothing 1
t 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
but 1
the 1
boys 1
hand 1
shook 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
spilled 1
his 1
coffee 1
and 1
you 1
do 1
talk 1
such 1
stuff 1
sid 1
said 1
last 1
night 1
you 1
said 1
its 1
blood 1
its 1
blood 1
thats 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
and 1
you 1
said 1
dont 1
torment 1
me 1
soill 1
tell 1
tell 1
_what_ 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
youll 1
tell 1
everything 1
was 1
swimming 1
before 1
tom 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
telling 1
what 1
might 1
have 1
happened 1
now 1
but 1
luckily 1
the 1
concern 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
aunt 1
pollys 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
toms 1
relief 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
she 1
said 1
sho 1
its 1
that 1
dreadful 1
murder 1
i 1
dream 1
about 1
it 1
most 1
every 1
night 1
myself 1
sometimes 1
i 1
dream 1
its 1
me 1
that 1
done 1
it 1
mary 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
affected 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
sid 1
seemed 1
satisfied 1
tom 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
presence 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
he 1
plausibly 1
could 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
complained 1
of 1
toothache 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
his 1
jaws 1
every 1
night 1
he 1
never 1
knew 1
that 1
sid 1
lay 1
nightly 1
watching 1
and 1
frequently 1
slipped 1
the 1
bandage 1
free 1
and 1
then 1
leaned 1
on 1
his 1
elbow 1
listening 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
afterward 1
slipped 1
the 1
bandage 1
back 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
again 1
toms 1
distress 1
of 1
mind 1
wore 1
off 1
gradually 1
and 1
the 1
toothache 1
grew 1
irksome 1
and 1
was 1
discarded 1
if 1
sid 1
really 1
managed 1
to 1
make 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
toms 1
disjointed 1
mutterings 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
to 1
himself 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
tom 1
that 1
his 1
schoolmates 1
never 1
would 1
get 1
done 1
holding 1
inquests 1
on 1
dead 1
cats 1
and 1
thus 1
keeping 1
his 1
trouble 1
present 1
to 1
his 1
mind 1
sid 1
noticed 1
that 1
tom 1
never 1
was 1
coroner 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
inquiries 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
habit 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
lead 1
in 1
all 1
new 1
enterprises 1
he 1
noticed 1
too 1
that 1
tom 1
never 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
witnessand 1
that 1
was 1
strange 1
and 1
sid 1
did 1
not 1
overlook 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
tom 1
even 1
showed 1
a 1
marked 1
aversion 1
to 1
these 1
inquests 1
and 1
always 1
avoided 1
them 1
when 1
he 1
could 1
sid 1
marvelled 1
but 1
said 1
nothing 1
however 1
even 1
inquests 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
vogue 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
ceased 1
to 1
torture 1
toms 1
conscience 1
every 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
sorrow 1
tom 1
watched 1
his 1
opportunity 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
grated 1
jailwindow 1
and 1
smuggled 1
such 1
small 1
comforts 1
through 1
to 1
the 1
murderer 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
jail 1
was 1
a 1
trifling 1
little 1
brick 1
den 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
a 1
marsh 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
no 1
guards 1
were 1
afforded 1
for 1
it 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
seldom 1
occupied 1
these 1
offerings 1
greatly 1
helped 1
to 1
ease 1
toms 1
conscience 1
the 1
villagers 1
had 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
tarandfeather 1
injun 1
joe 1
and 1
ride 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
rail 1
for 1
bodysnatching 1
but 1
so 1
formidable 1
was 1
his 1
character 1
that 1
nobody 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
who 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
lead 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
dropped 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
careful 1
to 1
begin 1
both 1
of 1
his 1
inqueststatements 1
with 1
the 1
fight 1
without 1
confessing 1
the 1
graverobbery 1
that 1
preceded 1
it 1
therefore 1
it 1
was 1
deemed 1
wisest 1
not 1
to 1
try 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
the 1
courts 1
at 1
present 1
chapter 1
xii 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
reasons 1
why 1
toms 1
mind 1
had 1
drifted 1
away 1
from 1
its 1
secret 1
troubles 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
weighty 1
matter 1
to 1
interest 1
itself 1
about 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
had 1
stopped 1
coming 1
to 1
school 1
tom 1
had 1
struggled 1
with 1
his 1
pride 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
whistle 1
her 1
down 1
the 1
wind 1
but 1
failed 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
find 1
himself 1
hanging 1
around 1
her 1
fathers 1
house 1
nights 1
and 1
feeling 1
very 1
miserable 1
she 1
was 1
ill 1
what 1
if 1
she 1
should 1
die 1
there 1
was 1
distraction 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
he 1
no 1
longer 1
took 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
war 1
nor 1
even 1
in 1
piracy 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
gone 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
but 1
dreariness 1
left 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hoop 1
away 1
and 1
his 1
bat 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
joy 1
in 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
his 1
aunt 1
was 1
concerned 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
try 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
remedies 1
on 1
him 1
she 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
infatuated 1
with 1
patent 1
medicines 1
and 1
all 1
newfangled 1
methods 1
of 1
producing 1
health 1
or 1
mending 1
it 1
she 1
was 1
an 1
inveterate 1
experimenter 1
in 1
these 1
things 1
when 1
something 1
fresh 1
in 1
this 1
line 1
came 1
out 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
fever 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
not 1
on 1
herself 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
ailing 1
but 1
on 1
anybody 1
else 1
that 1
came 1
handy 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
subscriber 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
health 1
periodicals 1
and 1
phrenological 1
frauds 1
and 1
the 1
solemn 1
ignorance 1
they 1
were 1
inflated 1
with 1
was 1
breath 1
to 1
her 1
nostrils 1
all 1
the 1
rot 1
they 1
contained 1
about 1
ventilation 1
and 1
how 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
what 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
what 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
exercise 1
to 1
take 1
and 1
what 1
frame 1
of 1
mind 1
to 1
keep 1
ones 1
self 1
in 1
and 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
clothing 1
to 1
wear 1
was 1
all 1
gospel 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
never 1
observed 1
that 1
her 1
healthjournals 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
month 1
customarily 1
upset 1
everything 1
they 1
had 1
recommended 1
the 1
month 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
as 1
simplehearted 1
and 1
honest 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
an 1
easy 1
victim 1
she 1
gathered 1
together 1
her 1
quack 1
periodicals 1
and 1
her 1
quack 1
medicines 1
and 1
thus 1
armed 1
with 1
death 1
went 1
about 1
on 1
her 1
pale 1
horse 1
metaphorically 1
speaking 1
with 1
hell 1
following 1
after 1
but 1
she 1
never 1
suspected 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
angel 1
of 1
healing 1
and 1
the 1
balm 1
of 1
gilead 1
in 1
disguise 1
to 1
the 1
suffering 1
neighbors 1
the 1
water 1
treatment 1
was 1
new 1
now 1
and 1
toms 1
low 1
condition 1
was 1
a 1
windfall 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
him 1
out 1
at 1
daylight 1
every 1
morning 1
stood 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
woodshed 1
and 1
drowned 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
deluge 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
then 1
she 1
scrubbed 1
him 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
towel 1
like 1
a 1
file 1
and 1
so 1
brought 1
him 1
to 1
then 1
she 1
rolled 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
wet 1
sheet 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
away 1
under 1
blankets 1
till 1
she 1
sweated 1
his 1
soul 1
clean 1
and 1
the 1
yellow 1
stains 1
of 1
it 1
came 1
through 1
his 1
poresas 1
tom 1
said 1
yet 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
this 1
the 1
boy 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
melancholy 1
and 1
pale 1
and 1
dejected 1
she 1
added 1
hot 1
baths 1
sitz 1
baths 1
shower 1
baths 1
and 1
plunges 1
the 1
boy 1
remained 1
as 1
dismal 1
as 1
a 1
hearse 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
assist 1
the 1
water 1
with 1
a 1
slim 1
oatmeal 1
diet 1
and 1
blisterplasters 1
she 1
calculated 1
his 1
capacity 1
as 1
she 1
would 1
a 1
jugs 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
up 1
every 1
day 1
with 1
quack 1
curealls 1
tom 1
had 1
become 1
indifferent 1
to 1
persecution 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
this 1
phase 1
filled 1
the 1
old 1
ladys 1
heart 1
with 1
consternation 1
this 1
indifference 1
must 1
be 1
broken 1
up 1
at 1
any 1
cost 1
now 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
painkiller 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
she 1
ordered 1
a 1
lot 1
at 1
once 1
she 1
tasted 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
gratitude 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
fire 1
in 1
a 1
liquid 1
form 1
she 1
dropped 1
the 1
water 1
treatment 1
and 1
everything 1
else 1
and 1
pinned 1
her 1
faith 1
to 1
painkiller 1
she 1
gave 1
tom 1
a 1
teaspoonful 1
and 1
watched 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
anxiety 1
for 1
the 1
result 1
her 1
troubles 1
were 1
instantly 1
at 1
rest 1
her 1
soul 1
at 1
peace 1
again 1
for 1
the 1
indifference 1
was 1
broken 1
up 1
the 1
boy 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
shown 1
a 1
wilder 1
heartier 1
interest 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
him 1
tom 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
wake 1
up 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
might 1
be 1
romantic 1
enough 1
in 1
his 1
blighted 1
condition 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
to 1
have 1
too 1
little 1
sentiment 1
and 1
too 1
much 1
distracting 1
variety 1
about 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
thought 1
over 1
various 1
plans 1
for 1
relief 1
and 1
finally 1
hit 1
upon 1
that 1
of 1
professing 1
to 1
be 1
fond 1
of 1
painkiller 1
he 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
so 1
often 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
nuisance 1
and 1
his 1
aunt 1
ended 1
by 1
telling 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
and 1
quit 1
bothering 1
her 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
sid 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
no 1
misgivings 1
to 1
alloy 1
her 1
delight 1
but 1
since 1
it 1
was 1
tom 1
she 1
watched 1
the 1
bottle 1
clandestinely 1
she 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
medicine 1
did 1
really 1
diminish 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
mending 1
the 1
health 1
of 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
floor 1
with 1
it 1
one 1
day 1
tom 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
dosing 1
the 1
crack 1
when 1
his 1
aunts 1
yellow 1
cat 1
came 1
along 1
purring 1
eyeing 1
the 1
teaspoon 1
avariciously 1
and 1
begging 1
for 1
a 1
taste 1
tom 1
said 1
dont 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
unless 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
peter 1
but 1
peter 1
signified 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
want 1
it 1
you 1
better 1
make 1
sure 1
peter 1
was 1
sure 1
now 1
youve 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
ill 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
because 1
there 1
aint 1
anything 1
mean 1
about 1
me 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
find 1
you 1
dont 1
like 1
it 1
you 1
mustnt 1
blame 1
anybody 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
self 1
peter 1
was 1
agreeable 1
so 1
tom 1
pried 1
his 1
mouth 1
open 1
and 1
poured 1
down 1
the 1
painkiller 1
peter 1
sprang 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
yards 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
delivered 1
a 1
warwhoop 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
banging 1
against 1
furniture 1
upsetting 1
flowerpots 1
and 1
making 1
general 1
havoc 1
next 1
he 1
rose 1
on 1
his 1
hind 1
feet 1
and 1
pranced 1
around 1
in 1
a 1
frenzy 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
proclaiming 1
his 1
unappeasable 1
happiness 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
tearing 1
around 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
spreading 1
chaos 1
and 1
destruction 1
in 1
his 1
path 1
aunt 1
polly 1
entered 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
throw 1
a 1
few 1
double 1
summersets 1
deliver 1
a 1
final 1
mighty 1
hurrah 1
and 1
sail 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
carrying 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
flowerpots 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
stood 1
petrified 1
with 1
astonishment 1
peering 1
over 1
her 1
glasses 1
tom 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
expiring 1
with 1
laughter 1
tom 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
ails 1
that 1
cat 1
i 1
dont 1

the 1
old 1
lady 1
was 1
bending 1
down 1
tom 1
watching 1
with 1
interest 1
emphasized 1
by 1
anxiety 1
too 1
late 1
he 1
divined 1
her 1
drift 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
telltale 1
teaspoon 1

visible 1
under 1

by 1

with 1

if 1
he 1

a 1
human 1
aunt 1
polly 1
felt 1
a 1
sudden 1
pang 1
of 1
remorse 1
this 1
was 1
putting 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
what 1
was 1
cruelty 1
to 1
a 1
cat 1
_might_ 1
be 1
cruelty 1
to 1
a 1
boy 1
too 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
soften 1
she 1
felt 1
sorry 1
her 1
eyes 1
watered 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
toms 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
gently 1
i 1
was 1
meaning 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
tom 1
and 1
tom 1
it 1
_did_ 1
do 1

good 1
tom 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
with 1
just 1
a 1
perceptible 1
twinkle 1
peeping 1
through 1
his 1
gravity 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
was 1
meaning 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
aunty 1

around 1
so 1
since 1
oh 1

tom 1
before 1

aggravate 1
me 1
again 1
and 1
you 1
try 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
cant 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
for 1
once 1
and 1
you 1
neednt 1
take 1
any 1
more 1
medicine 1
tom 1
reached 1
school 1
ahead 1
of 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
noticed 1
that 1
this 1
strange 1
thing 1
had 1
been 1
occurring 1
every 1
day 1
latterly 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
usual 1
of 1
late 1
he 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
schoolyard 1
instead 1
of 1
playing 1
with 1
his 1
comrades 1
he 1
was 1
sick 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
it 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
everywhere 1
but 1
whither 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
lookingdown 1
the 1
road 1
presently 1
jeff 1
thatcher 1
hove 1
in 1
sight 1
and 1
toms 1
face 1
lighted 1
he 1
gazed 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
sorrowfully 1
away 1
when 1
jeff 1
arrived 1
tom 1
accosted 1
him 1
and 1
led 1
up 1
warily 1
to 1
opportunities 1
for 1
remark 1
about 1
becky 1
but 1
the 1
giddy 1
lad 1
never 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
bait 1
tom 1
watched 1
and 1
watched 1
hoping 1
whenever 1
a 1
frisking 1
frock 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
and 1
hating 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
one 1
at 1
last 1
frocks 1
ceased 1
to 1
appear 1
and 1
he 1
dropped 1
hopelessly 1
into 1
the 1
dumps 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
empty 1
schoolhouse 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
suffer 1
then 1
one 1
more 1
frock 1
passed 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
and 1
toms 1
heart 1
gave 1
a 1
great 1
bound 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
and 1
going 1
on 1
like 1
an 1
indian 1
yelling 1
laughing 1
chasing 1
boys 1
jumping 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
at 1
risk 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
limb 1
throwing 1
handsprings 1
standing 1
on 1
his 1
headdoing 1
all 1
the 1
heroic 1
things 1
he 1
could 1
conceive 1
of 1
and 1
keeping 1
a 1
furtive 1
eye 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
while 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
becky 1
thatcher 1
was 1
noticing 1
but 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
unconscious 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
she 1
never 1
looked 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
he 1
carried 1
his 1
exploits 1
to 1
her 1
immediate 1
vicinity 1
came 1
warwhooping 1
around 1
snatched 1
a 1
boys 1
cap 1
hurled 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
broke 1
through 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
tumbling 1
them 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
and 1
fell 1
sprawling 1
himself 1
under 1
beckys 1
nose 1
almost 1
upsetting 1
herand 1
she 1
turned 1
with 1
her 1
nose 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
her 1
say 1
mf 1
some 1
people 1
think 1
theyre 1
mighty 1
smartalways 1
showing 1
off 1
toms 1
cheeks 1
burned 1
he 1
gathered 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
sneaked 1
off 1
crushed 1
and 1
crestfallen 1
chapter 1
xiii 1
toms 1
mind 1
was 1
made 1
up 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
gloomy 1
and 1
desperate 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
forsaken 1
friendless 1
boy 1
he 1
said 1
nobody 1
loved 1
him 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
out 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
driven 1
him 1
to 1
perhaps 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
sorry 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
and 1
get 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
since 1
nothing 1
would 1
do 1
them 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
let 1
it 1
be 1
so 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
blame 1
_him_ 1
for 1
the 1
consequenceswhy 1
shouldnt 1
they 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
the 1
friendless 1
to 1
complain 1
yes 1
they 1
had 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
would 1
lead 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
crime 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
choice 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
far 1
down 1
meadow 1
lane 1
and 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
school 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
tinkled 1
faintly 1
upon 1
his 1
ear 1
he 1
sobbed 1
now 1
to 1
think 1
he 1
should 1
never 1
never 1
hear 1
that 1
old 1
familiar 1
sound 1
any 1
moreit 1
was 1
very 1
hard 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
forced 1
on 1
him 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
driven 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
he 1
must 1
submitbut 1
he 1
forgave 1
them 1
then 1
the 1
sobs 1
came 1
thick 1
and 1
fast 1
just 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
souls 1
sworn 1
comrade 1
joe 1
harperhardeyed 1
and 1
with 1
evidently 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
dismal 1
purpose 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
plainly 1
here 1
were 1
two 1
souls 1
with 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
thought 1
tom 1
wiping 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
sleeve 1
began 1
to 1
blubber 1
out 1
something 1
about 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
hard 1
usage 1
and 1
lack 1
of 1
sympathy 1
at 1
home 1
by 1
roaming 1
abroad 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
world 1
never 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
ended 1
by 1
hoping 1
that 1
joe 1
would 1
not 1
forget 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
transpired 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
request 1
which 1
joe 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
tom 1
and 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
hunt 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
his 1
mother 1
had 1
whipped 1
him 1
for 1
drinking 1
some 1
cream 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
tasted 1
and 1
knew 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
if 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
way 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
succumb 1
he 1
hoped 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
never 1
regret 1
having 1
driven 1
her 1
poor 1
boy 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
unfeeling 1
world 1
to 1
suffer 1
and 1
die 1
as 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
walked 1
sorrowing 1
along 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
new 1
compact 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
be 1
brothers 1
and 1
never 1
separate 1
till 1
death 1
relieved 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
troubles 1
then 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
lay 1
their 1
plans 1
joe 1
was 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
hermit 1
and 1
living 1
on 1
crusts 1
in 1
a 1
remote 1
cave 1
and 1
dying 1
some 1
time 1
of 1
cold 1
and 1
want 1
and 1
grief 1
but 1
after 1
listening 1
to 1
tom 1
he 1
conceded 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
conspicuous 1
advantages 1
about 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
crime 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
consented 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
three 1
miles 1
below 1
st 1
petersburg 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
the 1
mississippi 1
river 1
was 1
a 1
trifle 1
over 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
narrow 1
wooded 1
island 1
with 1
a 1
shallow 1
bar 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
this 1
offered 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
rendezvous 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
inhabited 1
it 1
lay 1
far 1
over 1
toward 1
the 1
further 1
shore 1
abreast 1
a 1
dense 1
and 1
almost 1
wholly 1
unpeopled 1
forest 1
so 1
jacksons 1
island 1
was 1
chosen 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
subjects 1
of 1
their 1
piracies 1
was 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
them 1
then 1
they 1
hunted 1
up 1
huckleberry 1
finn 1
and 1
he 1
joined 1
them 1
promptly 1
for 1
all 1
careers 1
were 1
one 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
indifferent 1
they 1
presently 1
separated 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
a 1
lonely 1
spot 1
on 1
the 1
riverbank 1
two 1
miles 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
at 1
the 1
favorite 1
hourwhich 1
was 1
midnight 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
log 1
raft 1
there 1
which 1
they 1
meant 1
to 1
capture 1
each 1
would 1
bring 1
hooks 1
and 1
lines 1
and 1
such 1
provision 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
steal 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
dark 1
and 1
mysterious 1
wayas 1
became 1
outlaws 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
afternoon 1
was 1
done 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
managed 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
sweet 1
glory 1
of 1
spreading 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
town 1
would 1
hear 1
something 1
all 1
who 1
got 1
this 1
vague 1
hint 1
were 1
cautioned 1
to 1
be 1
mum 1
and 1
wait 1
about 1
midnight 1
tom 1
arrived 1
with 1
a 1
boiled 1
ham 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
trifles 1
and 1
stopped 1
in 1
a 1
dense 1
undergrowth 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
bluff 1
overlooking 1
the 1
meetingplace 1
it 1
was 1
starlight 1
and 1
very 1
still 1
the 1
mighty 1
river 1
lay 1
like 1
an 1
ocean 1
at 1
rest 1
tom 1
listened 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
no 1
sound 1
disturbed 1
the 1
quiet 1
then 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
low 1
distinct 1
whistle 1
it 1
was 1
answered 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bluff 1
tom 1
whistled 1
twice 1
more 1
these 1
signals 1
were 1
answered 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
then 1
a 1
guarded 1
voice 1
said 1
who 1
goes 1
there 1
tom 1
sawyer 1
the 1
black 1
avenger 1
of 1
the 1
spanish 1
main 1
name 1
your 1
names 1
huck 1
finn 1
the 1
redhanded 1
and 1
joe 1
harper 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
tom 1
had 1
furnished 1
these 1
titles 1
from 1
his 1
favorite 1
literature 1
tis 1
well 1
give 1
the 1
countersign 1
two 1
hoarse 1
whispers 1
delivered 1
the 1
same 1
awful 1
word 1
simultaneously 1
to 1
the 1
brooding 1
night 1
_blood_ 1
then 1
tom 1
tumbled 1
his 1
ham 1
over 1
the 1
bluff 1
and 1
let 1
himself 1
down 1
after 1
it 1
tearing 1
both 1
skin 1
and 1
clothes 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
in 1
the 1
effort 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
easy 1
comfortable 1
path 1
along 1
the 1
shore 1
under 1
the 1
bluff 1
but 1
it 1
lacked 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
difficulty 1
and 1
danger 1
so 1
valued 1
by 1
a 1
pirate 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
had 1
brought 1
a 1
side 1
of 1
bacon 1
and 1
had 1
about 1
worn 1
himself 1
out 1
with 1
getting 1
it 1
there 1
finn 1
the 1
redhanded 1
had 1
stolen 1
a 1
skillet 1
and 1
a 1
quantity 1
of 1
halfcured 1
leaf 1
tobacco 1
and 1
had 1
also 1
brought 1
a 1
few 1
corncobs 1
to 1
make 1
pipes 1
with 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
pirates 1
smoked 1
or 1
chewed 1
but 1
himself 1
the 1
black 1
avenger 1
of 1
the 1
spanish 1
main 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
do 1
to 1
start 1
without 1
some 1
fire 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
wise 1
thought 1
matches 1
were 1
hardly 1
known 1
there 1
in 1
that 1
day 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
fire 1
smouldering 1
upon 1
a 1
great 1
raft 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
above 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
stealthily 1
thither 1
and 1
helped 1
themselves 1
to 1
a 1
chunk 1
they 1
made 1
an 1
imposing 1
adventure 1
of 1
it 1
saying 1
hist 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
suddenly 1
halting 1
with 1
finger 1
on 1
lip 1
moving 1
with 1
hands 1
on 1
imaginary 1
daggerhilts 1
and 1
giving 1
orders 1
in 1
dismal 1
whispers 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
foe 1
stirred 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
hilt 1
because 1
dead 1
men 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
they 1
knew 1
well 1
enough 1
that 1
the 1
raftsmen 1
were 1
all 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
laying 1
in 1
stores 1
or 1
having 1
a 1
spree 1
but 1
still 1
that 1
was 1
no 1
excuse 1
for 1
their 1
conducting 1
this 1
thing 1
in 1
an 1
unpiratical 1
way 1
they 1
shoved 1
off 1
presently 1
tom 1
in 1
command 1
huck 1
at 1
the 1
after 1
oar 1
and 1
joe 1
at 1
the 1
forward 1
tom 1
stood 1
amidships 1
gloomybrowed 1
and 1
with 1
folded 1
arms 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
orders 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
stern 1
whisper 1
luff 1

as 1
the 1
boys 1
steadily 1
and 1
monotonously 1
drove 1
the 1
raft 1
toward 1
midstream 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
understood 1
that 1
these 1
orders 1
were 1
given 1
only 1
for 1
style 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
intended 1
to 1
mean 1
anything 1

sir 1
the 1
raft 1
drew 1
beyond 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
the 1
boys 1
pointed 1
her 1
head 1
right 1
and 1
then 1
lay 1
on 1
their 1
oars 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
not 1
high 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
mile 1
current 1
hardly 1
a 1
word 1
was 1
said 1
during 1
the 1
next 1
threequarters 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
now 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
passing 1
before 1
the 1
distant 1
town 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
glimmering 1
lights 1
showed 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
peacefully 1
sleeping 1
beyond 1
the 1
vague 1
vast 1
sweep 1
of 1
stargemmed 1
water 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
event 1
that 1
was 1
happening 1
the 1
black 1
avenger 1
stood 1
still 1
with 1
folded 1
arms 1
looking 1
his 1
last 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
his 1
former 1
joys 1
and 1
his 1
later 1
sufferings 1
and 1
wishing 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
abroad 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
sea 1
facing 1
peril 1
and 1
death 1
with 1
dauntless 1
heart 1
going 1
to 1
his 1
doom 1
with 1
a 1
grim 1
smile 1
on 1
his 1
lips 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
strain 1
on 1
his 1
imagination 1
to 1
remove 1
jacksons 1
island 1
beyond 1
eyeshot 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
looked 1
his 1
last 1
with 1
a 1
broken 1
and 1
satisfied 1
heart 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
were 1
looking 1
their 1
last 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
looked 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
they 1
came 1
near 1
letting 1
the 1
current 1
drift 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
but 1
they 1
discovered 1
the 1
danger 1
in 1
time 1
and 1
made 1
shift 1
to 1
avert 1
it 1
about 1
two 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
raft 1
grounded 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
above 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
they 1
waded 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
until 1
they 1
had 1
landed 1
their 1
freight 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
rafts 1
belongings 1
consisted 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
sail 1
and 1
this 1
they 1
spread 1
over 1
a 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
bushes 1
for 1
a 1
tent 1
to 1
shelter 1
their 1
provisions 1
but 1
they 1
themselves 1
would 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
in 1
good 1
weather 1
as 1
became 1
outlaws 1
they 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
against 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
log 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
steps 1
within 1
the 1
sombre 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
then 1
cooked 1
some 1
bacon 1
in 1
the 1
fryingpan 1
for 1
supper 1
and 1
used 1
up 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
corn 1
pone 1
stock 1
they 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
seemed 1
glorious 1
sport 1
to 1
be 1
feasting 1
in 1
that 1
wild 1
free 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
virgin 1
forest 1
of 1
an 1
unexplored 1
and 1
uninhabited 1
island 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
haunts 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
never 1
would 1
return 1
to 1
civilization 1
the 1
climbing 1
fire 1
lit 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
threw 1
its 1
ruddy 1
glare 1
upon 1
the 1
pillared 1
treetrunks 1
of 1
their 1
forest 1
temple 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
varnished 1
foliage 1
and 1
festooning 1
vines 1
when 1
the 1
last 1
crisp 1
slice 1
of 1
bacon 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
allowance 1
of 1
corn 1
pone 1
devoured 1
the 1
boys 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
filled 1
with 1
contentment 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
cooler 1
place 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
deny 1
themselves 1
such 1
a 1
romantic 1
feature 1
as 1
the 1
roasting 1
campfire 1
_aint_ 1
it 1
gay 1
said 1
joe 1
its 1
_nuts_ 1
said 1
tom 1

weed 1
stem 1
to 1

with 1
tobacco 1
and 1
was 1
pressing 1
a 1
coal 1
to 1
the 1
charge 1
and 1
blowing 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
fragrant 1
smokehe 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
full 1
bloom 1
of 1
luxurious 1
contentment 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
envied 1
him 1
this 1
majestic 1
vice 1
and 1
secretly 1
resolved 1
to 1

shortly 1
presently 1
huck 1

bulliest 1
clothes 1
oh 1

and 1
silver 1
and 1
dimonds 1
said 1
joe 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
who 1
said 1
huck 1
why 1
the 1
pirates 1
huck 1
scanned 1
his 1
own 1
clothing 1
forlornly 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
aint 1
dressed 1
fitten 1
for 1
a 1
pirate 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
regretful 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
but 1
i 1
aint 1
got 1
none 1
but 1
these 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
fine 1
clothes 1
would 1
come 1
fast 1
enough 1
after 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
begun 1
their 1
adventures 1
they 1
made 1
him 1
understand 1
that 1
his 1
poor 1
rags 1
would 1
do 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
customary 1
for 1
wealthy 1
pirates 1
to 1
start 1
with 1
a 1
proper 1
wardrobe 1
gradually 1
their 1
talk 1
died 1
out 1
and 1
drowsiness 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
upon 1
the 1
eyelids 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
waifs 1
the 1
pipe 1
dropped 1
from 1
the 1
fingers 1
of 1
the 1
redhanded 1
and 1
he 1
slept 1
the 1
sleep 1
of 1
the 1
consciencefree 1
and 1
the 1
weary 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
avenger 1
of 1
the 1
spanish 1
main 1
had 1
more 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
to 1
sleep 1
they 1
said 1
their 1
prayers 1
inwardly 1
and 1
lying 1
down 1
since 1
there 1
was 1
nobody 1
there 1
with 1
authority 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
kneel 1
and 1
recite 1
aloud 1
in 1
truth 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
not 1
to 1
say 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
to 1
proceed 1
to 1
such 1
lengths 1
as 1
that 1
lest 1
they 1
might 1
call 1
down 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
special 1
thunderbolt 1
from 1
heaven 1
then 1
at 1
once 1
they 1
reached 1
and 1
hovered 1
upon 1
the 1
imminent 1
verge 1
of 1
sleepbut 1
an 1
intruder 1
came 1
now 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
down 1
it 1
was 1
conscience 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
vague 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
wrong 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
next 1
they 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
stolen 1
meat 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
real 1
torture 1
came 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
argue 1
it 1
away 1
by 1
reminding 1
conscience 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
purloined 1
sweetmeats 1
and 1
apples 1
scores 1
of 1
times 1
but 1
conscience 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
appeased 1
by 1
such 1
thin 1
plausibilities 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
the 1
stubborn 1
fact 1
that 1
taking 1
sweetmeats 1
was 1
only 1
hooking 1
while 1
taking 1
bacon 1
and 1
hams 1
and 1
such 1
valuables 1
was 1
plain 1
simple 1
stealingand 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
command 1
against 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
bible 1
so 1
they 1
inwardly 1
resolved 1
that 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
their 1
piracies 1
should 1
not 1
again 1
be 1
sullied 1
with 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
stealing 1
then 1
conscience 1
granted 1
a 1
truce 1
and 1
these 1
curiously 1
inconsistent 1
pirates 1
fell 1
peacefully 1
to 1
sleep 1
chapter 1
xiv 1
when 1
tom 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
wondered 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
then 1
he 1
comprehended 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
cool 1
gray 1
dawn 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
delicious 1
sense 1
of 1
repose 1
and 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
pervading 1
calm 1
and 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
not 1
a 1
leaf 1
stirred 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
obtruded 1
upon 1
great 1
natures 1
meditation 1
beaded 1
dewdrops 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
grasses 1
a 1
white 1
layer 1
of 1
ashes 1
covered 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
a 1
thin 1
blue 1
breath 1
of 1
smoke 1
rose 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
joe 1
and 1
huck 1
still 1
slept 1
now 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
a 1
bird 1
called 1
another 1
answered 1
presently 1
the 1
hammering 1
of 1
a 1
woodpecker 1
was 1
heard 1
gradually 1
the 1
cool 1
dim 1
gray 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
whitened 1
and 1
as 1
gradually 1
sounds 1
multiplied 1
and 1
life 1
manifested 1
itself 1
the 1
marvel 1
of 1
nature 1
shaking 1
off 1
sleep 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
work 1
unfolded 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
musing 1
boy 1
a 1
little 1
green 1
worm 1
came 1
crawling 1
over 1
a 1
dewy 1
leaf 1
lifting 1
twothirds 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
sniffing 1
around 1
then 1
proceeding 1
againfor 1
he 1
was 1
measuring 1
tom 1
said 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
worm 1
approached 1
him 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
a 1
stone 1
with 1
his 1
hopes 1
rising 1
and 1
falling 1
by 1
turns 1
as 1
the 1
creature 1
still 1
came 1
toward 1
him 1
or 1
seemed 1
inclined 1
to 1
go 1
elsewhere 1
and 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
considered 1
a 1
painful 1
moment 1
with 1
its 1
curved 1
body 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
came 1
decisively 1
down 1
upon 1
toms 1
leg 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
journey 1
over 1
him 1
his 1
whole 1
heart 1
was 1
gladfor 1
that 1
meant 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
suit 1
of 1
clotheswithout 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
a 1
gaudy 1
piratical 1
uniform 1
now 1
a 1
procession 1
of 1
ants 1
appeared 1
from 1
nowhere 1
in 1
particular 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
their 1
labors 1
one 1
struggled 1
manfully 1
by 1
with 1
a 1
dead 1
spider 1
five 1
times 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
itself 1
in 1
its 1
arms 1
and 1
lugged 1
it 1
straight 1
up 1
a 1
treetrunk 1
a 1
brown 1
spotted 1
ladybug 1
climbed 1
the 1
dizzy 1
height 1
of 1
a 1
grass 1
blade 1
and 1
tom 1
bent 1
down 1
close 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
ladybug 1
ladybug 1
fly 1
away 1
home 1
your 1
house 1
is 1
on 1
fire 1
your 1
childrens 1
alone 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
wing 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
see 1
about 1
itwhich 1
did 1
not 1
surprise 1
the 1
boy 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
old 1
that 1
this 1
insect 1
was 1
credulous 1
about 1
conflagrations 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
practised 1
upon 1
its 1
simplicity 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
a 1
tumblebug 1
came 1
next 1
heaving 1
sturdily 1
at 1
its 1
ball 1
and 1
tom 1
touched 1
the 1
creature 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
shut 1
its 1
legs 1
against 1
its 1
body 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
dead 1
the 1
birds 1
were 1
fairly 1
rioting 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
catbird 1
the 1
northern 1
mocker 1
lit 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
over 1
toms 1
head 1
and 1
trilled 1
out 1
her 1
imitations 1
of 1
her 1
neighbors 1
in 1
a 1
rapture 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
then 1
a 1
shrill 1
jay 1
swept 1
down 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
blue 1
flame 1
and 1
stopped 1
on 1
a 1
twig 1
almost 1
within 1
the 1
boys 1
reach 1
cocked 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
eyed 1
the 1
strangers 1
with 1
a 1
consuming 1
curiosity 1
a 1
gray 1
squirrel 1
and 1
a 1
big 1
fellow 1
of 1
the 1
fox 1
kind 1
came 1
skurrying 1
along 1
sitting 1
up 1
at 1
intervals 1
to 1
inspect 1
and 1
chatter 1
at 1
the 1
boys 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
things 1
had 1
probably 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
before 1
and 1
scarcely 1
knew 1
whether 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
or 1
not 1
all 1
nature 1
was 1
wide 1
awake 1
and 1
stirring 1
now 1
long 1
lances 1
of 1
sunlight 1
pierced 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
dense 1
foliage 1
far 1
and 1
near 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
butterflies 1
came 1
fluttering 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
tom 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
clattered 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
shout 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
were 1
stripped 1
and 1
chasing 1
after 1
and 1
tumbling 1
over 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
shallow 1
limpid 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
sandbar 1
they 1
felt 1
no 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
village 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
beyond 1
the 1
majestic 1
waste 1
of 1
water 1
a 1
vagrant 1
current 1
or 1
a 1
slight 1
rise 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
their 1
raft 1
but 1
this 1
only 1
gratified 1
them 1
since 1
its 1
going 1
was 1
something 1
like 1
burning 1
the 1
bridge 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
civilization 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
wonderfully 1
refreshed 1
gladhearted 1
and 1
ravenous 1
and 1
they 1
soon 1
had 1
the 1
campfire 1
blazing 1
up 1
again 1
huck 1
found 1
a 1
spring 1
of 1
clear 1
cold 1
water 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
made 1
cups 1
of 1
broad 1
oak 1
or 1
hickory 1
leaves 1
and 1
felt 1
that 1
water 1
sweetened 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wildwood 1
charm 1
as 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
substitute 1
for 1
coffee 1
while 1
joe 1
was 1
slicing 1
bacon 1
for 1
breakfast 1
tom 1
and 1
huck 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
a 1
minute 1
they 1
stepped 1
to 1
a 1
promising 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
riverbank 1
and 1
threw 1
in 1
their 1
lines 1
almost 1
immediately 1
they 1
had 1
reward 1
joe 1
had 1
not 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
impatient 1
before 1
they 1
were 1
back 1
again 1
with 1
some 1
handsome 1
bass 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
sunperch 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
catfishprovisions 1
enough 1
for 1
quite 1
a 1
family 1
they 1
fried 1
the 1
fish 1
with 1
the 1
bacon 1
and 1
were 1
astonished 1
for 1
no 1
fish 1
had 1
ever 1
seemed 1
so 1
delicious 1
before 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
quicker 1
a 1
freshwater 1
fish 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
after 1
he 1
is 1
caught 1
the 1
better 1
he 1
is 1
and 1
they 1
reflected 1
little 1
upon 1
what 1
a 1
sauce 1
openair 1
sleeping 1
openair 1
exercise 1
bathing 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
ingredient 1
of 1
hunger 1
make 1
too 1
they 1
lay 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
after 1
breakfast 1
while 1
huck 1
had 1
a 1
smoke 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
an 1
exploring 1
expedition 1
they 1
tramped 1
gayly 1
along 1
over 1
decaying 1
logs 1
through 1
tangled 1
underbrush 1
among 1
solemn 1
monarchs 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
hung 1
from 1
their 1
crowns 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
a 1
drooping 1
regalia 1
of 1
grapevines 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
upon 1
snug 1
nooks 1
carpeted 1
with 1
grass 1
and 1
jeweled 1
with 1
flowers 1
they 1
found 1
plenty 1
of 1
things 1
to 1
be 1
delighted 1
with 1
but 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
astonished 1
at 1
they 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
island 1
was 1
about 1
three 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
shore 1
it 1
lay 1
closest 1
to 1
was 1
only 1
separated 1
from 1
it 1
by 1
a 1
narrow 1
channel 1
hardly 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
wide 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
swim 1
about 1
every 1
hour 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
hungry 1
to 1
stop 1
to 1
fish 1
but 1
they 1
fared 1
sumptuously 1
upon 1
cold 1
ham 1
and 1
then 1
threw 1
themselves 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
to 1
talk 1
but 1
the 1
talk 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
drag 1
and 1
then 1
died 1
the 1
stillness 1
the 1
solemnity 1
that 1
brooded 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
loneliness 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
upon 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
they 1
fell 1
to 1
thinking 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
undefined 1
longing 1
crept 1
upon 1
them 1
this 1
took 1
dim 1
shape 1
presentlyit 1
was 1
budding 1
homesickness 1
even 1
finn 1
the 1
redhanded 1
was 1
dreaming 1
of 1
his 1
doorsteps 1
and 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
ashamed 1
of 1
their 1
weakness 1
and 1
none 1
was 1
brave 1
enough 1
to 1
speak 1
his 1
thought 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
now 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
been 1
dully 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
just 1
as 1
one 1
sometimes 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
a 1
clock 1
which 1
he 1
takes 1
no 1
distinct 1
note 1
of 1
but 1
now 1
this 1
mysterious 1
sound 1
became 1
more 1
pronounced 1
and 1
forced 1
a 1
recognition 1
the 1
boys 1
started 1
glanced 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
then 1
each 1
assumed 1
a 1
listening 1
attitude 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
profound 1
and 1
unbroken 1
then 1
a 1
deep 1
sullen 1
boom 1
came 1
floating 1
down 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
joe 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
i 1
wonder 1
said 1
tom 1
in 1
a 1
whisper 1
taint 1
thunder 1
said 1
huckleberry 1
in 1
an 1
awed 1
tone 1
becuz 1
thunder 1
hark 1
said 1
tom 1
listendont 1
talk 1
they 1
waited 1
a 1
time 1
that 1
seemed 1
an 1
age 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
same 1
muffled 1
boom 1
troubled 1
the 1
solemn 1
hush 1
lets 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
they 1
sprang 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
hurried 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
toward 1
the 1
town 1
they 1
parted 1
the 1
bushes 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
peered 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
little 1
steam 1
ferryboat 1
was 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
drifting 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
her 1
broad 1
deck 1
seemed 1
crowded 1
with 1
people 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
skiffs 1
rowing 1
about 1
or 1
floating 1
with 1
the 1
stream 1
in 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
but 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
not 1
determine 1
what 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
them 1
were 1
doing 1
presently 1
a 1
great 1
jet 1
of 1
white 1
smoke 1
burst 1
from 1
the 1
ferryboats 1
side 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
expanded 1
and 1
rose 1
in 1
a 1
lazy 1
cloud 1
that 1
same 1
dull 1
throb 1
of 1
sound 1
was 1
borne 1
to 1
the 1
listeners 1
again 1
i 1
know 1
now 1
exclaimed 1
tom 1
somebodys 1
drownded 1
thats 1
it 1
said 1
huck 1
they 1
done 1
that 1
last 1
summer 1
when 1
bill 1
turner 1
got 1
drownded 1
they 1
shoot 1
a 1
cannon 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
that 1
makes 1
him 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
yes 1
and 1
they 1
take 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
put 1
quicksilver 1
in 1
em 1
and 1
set 1
em 1
afloat 1
and 1
wherever 1
theres 1
anybody 1
thats 1
drownded 1
theyll 1
float 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
stop 1
yes 1
ive 1
heard 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
joe 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
makes 1
the 1
bread 1
do 1
that 1
oh 1
it 1
aint 1
the 1
bread 1
so 1
much 1
said 1
tom 1
i 1
reckon 1
its 1
mostly 1
what 1
they 1
_say_ 1
over 1
it 1
before 1
they 1
start 1
it 1
out 1
but 1
they 1
dont 1
say 1
anything 1
over 1
it 1
said 1
huck 1
ive 1
seen 1
em 1
and 1
they 1
dont 1
well 1
thats 1
funny 1
said 1
tom 1
but 1
maybe 1
they 1
say 1
it 1
to 1
themselves 1
of 1
_course_ 1
they 1
do 1
anybody 1
might 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
agreed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
reason 1
in 1
what 1
tom 1
said 1
because 1
an 1
ignorant 1
lump 1
of 1
bread 1
uninstructed 1
by 1
an 1
incantation 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
act 1
very 1
intelligently 1
when 1
set 1
upon 1
an 1
errand 1
of 1
such 1
gravity 1
by 1
jings 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
was 1
over 1
there 1
now 1
said 1
joe 1
i 1
do 1
too 1
said 1
huck 1
id 1
give 1
heaps 1
to 1
know 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
boys 1
still 1
listened 1
and 1
watched 1
presently 1
a 1
revealing 1
thought 1
flashed 1
through 1
toms 1
mind 1
and 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
boys 1
i 1
know 1
whos 1
drowndedits 1
us 1
they 1
felt 1
like 1
heroes 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
gorgeous 1
triumph 1
they 1
were 1
missed 1
they 1
were 1
mourned 1
hearts 1
were 1
breaking 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
tears 1
were 1
being 1
shed 1
accusing 1
memories 1
of 1
unkindness 1
to 1
these 1
poor 1
lost 1
lads 1
were 1
rising 1
up 1
and 1
unavailing 1
regrets 1
and 1
remorse 1
were 1
being 1
indulged 1
and 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
departed 1
were 1
the 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
and 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
this 1
dazzling 1
notoriety 1
was 1
concerned 1
this 1
was 1
fine 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
after 1
all 1
as 1
twilight 1
drew 1
on 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
accustomed 1
business 1
and 1
the 1
skiffs 1
disappeared 1
the 1
pirates 1
returned 1
to 1
camp 1
they 1
were 1
jubilant 1
with 1
vanity 1
over 1
their 1
new 1
grandeur 1
and 1
the 1
illustrious 1
trouble 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
they 1
caught 1
fish 1
cooked 1
supper 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
fell 1
to 1
guessing 1
at 1
what 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
thinking 1
and 1
saying 1
about 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
pictures 1
they 1
drew 1
of 1
the 1
public 1
distress 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
were 1
gratifying 1
to 1
look 1
uponfrom 1
their 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
night 1
closed 1
them 1
in 1
they 1
gradually 1
ceased 1
to 1
talk 1
and 1
sat 1
gazing 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
with 1
their 1
minds 1
evidently 1
wandering 1
elsewhere 1
the 1
excitement 1
was 1
gone 1
now 1
and 1
tom 1
and 1
joe 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
back 1
thoughts 1
of 1
certain 1
persons 1
at 1
home 1
who 1
were 1
not 1
enjoying 1
this 1
fine 1
frolic 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
misgivings 1
came 1
they 1
grew 1
troubled 1
and 1
unhappy 1
a 1
sigh 1
or 1
two 1
escaped 1
unawares 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
joe 1
timidly 1
ventured 1
upon 1
a 1
roundabout 1
feeler 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
the 1
others 1
might 1
look 1
upon 1
a 1
return 1
to 1
civilizationnot 1
right 1
now 1
but 1
tom 1
withered 1
him 1
with 1
derision 1
huck 1
being 1
uncommitted 1
as 1
yet 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
tom 1
and 1
the 1
waverer 1
quickly 1
explained 1
and 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
scrape 1
with 1
as 1
little 1
taint 1
of 1
chickenhearted 1
homesickness 1
clinging 1
to 1
his 1
garments 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
mutiny 1
was 1
effectually 1
laid 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
deepened 1
huck 1
began 1
to 1
nod 1
and 1
presently 1
to 1
snore 1
joe 1
followed 1
next 1
tom 1
lay 1
upon 1
his 1
elbow 1
motionless 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
watching 1
the 1
two 1
intently 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
cautiously 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
went 1
searching 1
among 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1
flickering 1
reflections 1
flung 1
by 1
the 1
campfire 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
and 1
inspected 1
several 1
large 1
semicylinders 1
of 1
the 1
thin 1
white 1
bark 1
of 1
a 1
sycamore 1
and 1
finally 1
chose 1
two 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
suit 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
knelt 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
painfully 1
wrote 1
something 1
upon 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
with 1
his 1
red 1
keel 1
one 1
he 1
rolled 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
joes 1
hat 1
and 1
removed 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
owner 1
and 1
he 1
also 1
put 1
into 1
the 1
hat 1
certain 1
schoolboy 1
treasures 1
of 1
almost 1
inestimable 1
valueamong 1
them 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
chalk 1
an 1
indiarubber 1
ball 1
three 1
fishhooks 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
marbles 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
sure 1
nough 1
crystal 1
then 1
he 1
tiptoed 1
his 1
way 1
cautiously 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
till 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
hearing 1
and 1
straightway 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
keen 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
sandbar 1
chapter 1
xv 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
tom 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
shoal 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
bar 1
wading 1
toward 1
the 1
illinois 1
shore 1
before 1
the 1
depth 1
reached 1
his 1
middle 1
he 1
was 1
halfway 1
over 1
the 1
current 1
would 1
permit 1
no 1
more 1
wading 1
now 1
so 1
he 1
struck 1
out 1
confidently 1
to 1
swim 1
the 1
remaining 1
hundred 1
yards 1
he 1
swam 1
quartering 1
upstream 1
but 1
still 1
was 1
swept 1
downward 1
rather 1
faster 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
expected 1
however 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
shore 1
finally 1
and 1
drifted 1
along 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
low 1
place 1
and 1
drew 1
himself 1
out 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
found 1
his 1
piece 1
of 1
bark 1
safe 1
and 1
then 1
struck 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
following 1
the 1
shore 1
with 1
streaming 1
garments 1
shortly 1
before 1
ten 1
oclock 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
into 1
an 1
open 1
place 1
opposite 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
high 1
bank 1
everything 1
was 1
quiet 1
under 1
the 1
blinking 1
stars 1
he 1
crept 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
watching 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
eyes 1
slipped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
swam 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
strokes 1
and 1
climbed 1
into 1
the 1
skiff 1
that 1
did 1
yawl 1
duty 1
at 1
the 1
boats 1
stern 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
under 1
the 1
thwarts 1
and 1
waited 1
panting 1
presently 1
the 1
cracked 1
bell 1
tapped 1
and 1
a 1
voice 1
gave 1
the 1
order 1
to 1
cast 1
off 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
later 1
the 1
skiffs 1
head 1
was 1
standing 1
high 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
boats 1
swell 1
and 1
the 1
voyage 1
was 1
begun 1
tom 1
felt 1
happy 1
in 1
his 1
success 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
boats 1
last 1
trip 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
twelve 1
or 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
the 1
wheels 1
stopped 1
and 1
tom 1
slipped 1
overboard 1
and 1
swam 1
ashore 1
in 1
the 1
dusk 1
landing 1
fifty 1
yards 1
downstream 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
of 1
possible 1
stragglers 1
he 1
flew 1
along 1
unfrequented 1
alleys 1
and 1
shortly 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
aunts 1
back 1
fence 1
he 1
climbed 1
over 1
approached 1
the 1
ell 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
window 1
for 1
a 1
light 1
was 1
burning 1
there 1
there 1
sat 1
aunt 1
polly 1
sid 1
mary 1
and 1
joe 1
harpers 1
mother 1
grouped 1
together 1
talking 1
they 1
were 1
by 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
the 1
bed 1
was 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
tom 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
softly 1
lift 1
the 1
latch 1
then 1
he 1
pressed 1
gently 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
yielded 1
a 1
crack 1
he 1
continued 1
pushing 1
cautiously 1
and 1
quaking 1
every 1
time 1
it 1
creaked 1
till 1
he 1
judged 1
he 1
might 1
squeeze 1
through 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
so 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
through 1
and 1
began 1
warily 1
what 1
makes 1
the 1
candle 1
blow 1
so 1
said 1
aunt 1
polly 1
tom 1
hurried 1
up 1
why 1
that 1
doors 1
open 1
i 1
believe 1
why 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
strange 1
things 1
now 1
go 1
long 1
and 1
shut 1
it 1
sid 1
tom 1
disappeared 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
he 1
lay 1
and 1
breathed 1
himself 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
crept 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
almost 1
touch 1
his 1
aunts 1
foot 1
but 1
as 1
i 1

yesterday 1
noon 1
my 1
tom 1
took 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
cat 1
full 1
of 1
painkiller 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
think 1
the 1
cretur 1
would 1
tear 1
the 1
house 1
down 1
and 1
god 1
forgive 1
me 1
i 1
cracked 1
toms 1
head 1
with 1
my 1
thimble 1
poor 1
boy 1
poor 1
dead 1
boy 1
but 1
hes 1
out 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
words 1
i 1
ever 1
heard 1
him 1
say 1
was 1
to 1
reproach 1
but 1
this 1
memory 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
and 1
she 1
broke 1
entirely 1
down 1
tom 1
was 1
snuffling 1
now 1
himselfand 1
more 1
in 1
pity 1
of 1
himself 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
mary 1
crying 1
and 1
putting 1
in 1
a 1
kindly 1
word 1
for 1
him 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
nobler 1
opinion 1
of 1
himself 1
than 1
ever 1
before 1
still 1
he 1
was 1
sufficiently 1
touched 1
by 1
his 1
aunts 1
grief 1
to 1
long 1
to 1
rush 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
overwhelm 1
her 1
with 1
joyand 1
the 1
theatrical 1
gorgeousness 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
appealed 1
strongly 1
to 1
his 1
nature 1
too 1
but 1
he 1
resisted 1
and 1
lay 1
still 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
listening 1
and 1
gathered 1
by 1
odds 1
and 1
ends 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
conjectured 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
got 1
drowned 1
while 1
taking 1
a 1
swim 1
then 1
the 1
small 1
raft 1
had 1
been 1
missed 1
next 1
certain 1
boys 1
said 1
the 1
missing 1
lads 1
had 1
promised 1
that 1
the 1
village 1
should 1
hear 1
something 1
soon 1
the 1
wiseheads 1
had 1
put 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
together 1
and 1
decided 1
that 1
the 1
lads 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
on 1
that 1
raft 1
and 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
next 1
town 1
below 1
presently 1
but 1
toward 1
noon 1
the 1
raft 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
lodged 1
against 1
the 1
missouri 1
shore 1
some 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
miles 1
below 1
the 1
villageand 1
then 1
hope 1
perished 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
drowned 1
else 1
hunger 1
would 1
have 1
driven 1
them 1
home 1
by 1
nightfall 1
if 1
not 1
sooner 1
it 1
was 1
believed 1
that 1
the 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
bodies 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
fruitless 1
effort 1
merely 1
because 1
the 1
drowning 1
must 1
have 1
occurred 1
in 1
midchannel 1
since 1
the 1
boys 1
being 1
good 1
swimmers 1
would 1
otherwise 1
have 1
escaped 1
to 1
shore 1
this 1
was 1
wednesday 1
night 1
if 1
the 1
bodies 1
continued 1
missing 1
until 1
sunday 1
all 1
hope 1
would 1
be 1
given 1
over 1
and 1
the 1
funerals 1
would 1
be 1
preached 1
on 1
that 1
morning 1
tom 1
shuddered 1
mrs 1
harper 1
gave 1
a 1
sobbing 1
goodnight 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
go 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
mutual 1
impulse 1
the 1
two 1
bereaved 1
women 1
flung 1
themselves 1
into 1
each 1
others 1
arms 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
consoling 1
cry 1
and 1
then 1
parted 1
aunt 1
polly 1
was 1
tender 1
far 1
beyond 1
her 1
wont 1
in 1
her 1
goodnight 1
to 1
sid 1
and 1
mary 1
sid 1
snuffled 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
mary 1
went 1
off 1
crying 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
heart 1
aunt 1
polly 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
prayed 1
for 1
tom 1
so 1
touchingly 1
so 1
appealingly 1
and 1
with 1
such 1
measureless 1
love 1
in 1
her 1
words 1
and 1
her 1
old 1
trembling 1
voice 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
weltering 1
in 1
tears 1
again 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
through 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
long 1
after 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
for 1
she 1
kept 1
making 1
brokenhearted 1
ejaculations 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
tossing 1
unrestfully 1
and 1
turning 1
over 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
only 1
moaning 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
her 1
sleep 1
now 1
the 1
boy 1
stole 1
out 1
rose 1
gradually 1
by 1
the 1
bedside 1
shaded 1
the 1
candlelight 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
stood 1
regarding 1
her 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
pity 1
for 1
her 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
his 1
sycamore 1
scroll 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
candle 1
but 1
something 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
lingered 1
considering 1
his 1
face 1
lighted 1
with 1
a 1
happy 1
solution 1
of 1
his 1
thought 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
bark 1
hastily 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
then 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
faded 1
lips 1
and 1
straightway 1
made 1
his 1
stealthy 1
exit 1
latching 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
threaded 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
found 1
nobody 1
at 1
large 1
there 1
and 1
walked 1
boldly 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
boat 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
tenantless 1
except 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
watchman 1
who 1
always 1
turned 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
like 1
a 1
graven 1
image 1
he 1
untied 1
the 1
skiff 1
at 1
the 1
stern 1
slipped 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
rowing 1
cautiously 1
upstream 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
pulled 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
he 1
started 1
quartering 1
across 1
and 1
bent 1
himself 1
stoutly 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
he 1
hit 1
the 1
landing 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
neatly 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
familiar 1
bit 1
of 1
work 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
moved 1
to 1
capture 1
the 1
skiff 1
arguing 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
considered 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
therefore 1
legitimate 1
prey 1
for 1
a 1
pirate 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
a 1
thorough 1
search 1
would 1
be 1
made 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
might 1
end 1
in 1
revelations 1
so 1
he 1
stepped 1
ashore 1
and 1
entered 1
the 1
woods 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
long 1
rest 1
torturing 1
himself 1
meanwhile 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
and 1
then 1
started 1
warily 1
down 1
the 1
homestretch 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
far 1
spent 1
it 1
was 1
broad 1
daylight 1
before 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
fairly 1
abreast 1
the 1
island 1
bar 1
he 1
rested 1
again 1
until 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
well 1
up 1
and 1
gilding 1
the 1
great 1
river 1
with 1
its 1
splendor 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
a 1
little 1
later 1
he 1
paused 1
dripping 1
upon 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
and 1
heard 1
joe 1
say 1
no 1
toms 1
trueblue 1
huck 1
and 1
hell 1
come 1
back 1
he 1
wont 1
desert 1
he 1
knows 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
disgrace 1
to 1
a 1
pirate 1
and 1
toms 1
too 1
proud 1
for 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
hes 1
up 1
to 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
now 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
well 1
the 1
things 1
is 1
ours 1
anyway 1
aint 1
they 1
pretty 1
near 1
but 1
not 1
yet 1
huck 1
the 1
writing 1
says 1
they 1
are 1
if 1
he 1
aint 1
back 1
here 1
to 1
breakfast 1
which 1
he 1
is 1
exclaimed 1
tom 1
with 1
fine 1
dramatic 1
effect 1
stepping 1
grandly 1
into 1
camp 1
a 1
sumptuous 1
breakfast 1
of 1
bacon 1
and 1
fish 1
was 1
shortly 1
provided 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
boys 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
upon 1
it 1
tom 1
recounted 1
and 1
adorned 1
his 1
adventures 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
vain 1
and 1
boastful 1
company 1
of 1
heroes 1
when 1
the 1
tale 1
was 1
done 1
then 1
tom 1
hid 1
himself 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
shady 1
nook 1
to 1
sleep 1
till 1
noon 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
fish 1
and 1
explore 1
chapter 1
xvi 1
after 1
dinner 1
all 1
the 1
gang 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
hunt 1
for 1
turtle 1
eggs 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
they 1
went 1
about 1
poking 1
sticks 1
into 1
the 1
sand 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
soft 1
place 1
they 1
went 1
down 1
on 1
their 1
knees 1
and 1
dug 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
sometimes 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
fifty 1
or 1
sixty 1
eggs 1
out 1
of 1
one 1
hole 1
they 1
were 1
perfectly 1
round 1
white 1
things 1
a 1
trifle 1
smaller 1
than 1
an 1
english 1
walnut 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
famous 1
friedegg 1
feast 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
another 1
on 1
friday 1
morning 1
after 1
breakfast 1
they 1
went 1
whooping 1
and 1
prancing 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
and 1
chased 1
each 1
other 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
shedding 1
clothes 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
until 1
they 1
were 1
naked 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
the 1
frolic 1
far 1
away 1
up 1
the 1
shoal 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
bar 1
against 1
the 1
stiff 1
current 1
which 1
latter 1
tripped 1
their 1
legs 1
from 1
under 1
them 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
greatly 1
increased 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
stooped 1
in 1
a 1
group 1
and 1
splashed 1
water 1
in 1
each 1
others 1
faces 1
with 1
their 1
palms 1
gradually 1
approaching 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
averted 1
faces 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
strangling 1
sprays 1
and 1
finally 1
gripping 1
and 1
struggling 1
till 1
the 1
best 1
man 1
ducked 1
his 1
neighbor 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
under 1
in 1
a 1
tangle 1
of 1
white 1
legs 1
and 1
arms 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
blowing 1
sputtering 1
laughing 1
and 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1
at 1
one 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
exhausted 1
they 1
would 1
run 1
out 1
and 1
sprawl 1
on 1
the 1
dry 1
hot 1
sand 1
and 1
lie 1
there 1
and 1
cover 1
themselves 1
up 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
break 1
for 1
the 1
water 1
again 1
and 1
go 1
through 1
the 1
original 1
performance 1
once 1
more 1
finally 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
their 1
naked 1
skin 1
represented 1
fleshcolored 1
tights 1
very 1
fairly 1
so 1
they 1
drew 1
a 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
circuswith 1
three 1
clowns 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
none 1
would 1
yield 1
this 1
proudest 1
post 1
to 1
his 1
neighbor 1
next 1
they 1
got 1
their 1
marbles 1
and 1
played 1
knucks 1
and 1
ringtaw 1
and 1
keeps 1
till 1
that 1
amusement 1
grew 1
stale 1
then 1
joe 1
and 1
huck 1
had 1
another 1
swim 1
but 1
tom 1
would 1
not 1
venture 1
because 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
kicking 1
off 1
his 1
trousers 1
he 1
had 1
kicked 1
his 1
string 1
of 1
rattlesnake 1
rattles 1
off 1
his 1
ankle 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
escaped 1
cramp 1
so 1
long 1
without 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
this 1
mysterious 1
charm 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
again 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
were 1
tired 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
rest 1
they 1
gradually 1
wandered 1
apart 1
dropped 1
into 1
the 1
dumps 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
gazing 1
longingly 1
across 1
the 1
wide 1
river 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
village 1
lay 1
drowsing 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
tom 1
found 1
himself 1
writing 1
becky 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
with 1
his 1
big 1
toe 1
he 1
scratched 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
was 1
angry 1
with 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
weakness 1
but 1
he 1
wrote 1
it 1
again 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
he 1
erased 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
took 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
temptation 1
by 1
driving 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
together 1
and 1
joining 1
them 1
but 1
joes 1
spirits 1
had 1
gone 1
down 1
almost 1
beyond 1
resurrection 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
homesick 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
endure 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
tears 1
lay 1
very 1
near 1
the 1
surface 1
huck 1
was 1
melancholy 1
too 1
tom 1
was 1
downhearted 1
but 1
tried 1
hard 1
not 1
to 1
show 1
it 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
ready 1
to 1
tell 1
yet 1
but 1
if 1
this 1
mutinous 1
depression 1
was 1
not 1
broken 1
up 1
soon 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
out 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
show 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
i 1
bet 1
theres 1
been 1
pirates 1
on 1
this 1
island 1
before 1
boys 1
well 1
explore 1
it 1
again 1
theyve 1
hid 1
treasures 1
here 1
somewhere 1
howd 1
you 1
feel 1
to 1
light 1
on 1
a 1
rotten 1
chest 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
silverhey 1
but 1
it 1
roused 1
only 1
faint 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
faded 1
out 1
with 1
no 1
reply 1
tom 1
tried 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
other 1
seductions 1
but 1
they 1
failed 1
too 1
it 1
was 1
discouraging 1
work 1
joe 1
sat 1
poking 1
up 1
the 1
sand 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
gloomy 1
finally 1
he 1
said 1
oh 1
boys 1

give 1
it 1
up 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1

tom 1

said 1
joe 1
rising 1
there 1
now 1
and 1
he 1
moved 1
moodily 1
away 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dress 1
himself 1
who 1
cares 1
said 1
tom 1

without 1
him 1
peraps 1
but 1
tom 1
was 1
uneasy 1
nevertheless 1
and 1
was 1
alarmed 1
to 1
see 1
joe 1
go 1
sullenly 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
dressing 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
discomforting 1
to 1
see 1
huck 1
eying 1
joes 1
preparations 1
so 1
wistfully 1
and 1
keeping 1
up 1
such 1
an 1
ominous 1
silence 1
presently 1
without 1
a 1
parting 1
word 1
joe 1
began 1
to 1
wade 1
off 1
toward 1
the 1
illinois 1
shore 1
toms 1
heart 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
he 1
glanced 1
at 1
huck 1
huck 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
look 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
eyes 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
too 1
tom 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
so 1
lonesome 1
anyway 1
and 1
now 1
itll 1
be 1
worse 1
lets 1
us 1
go 1

i 1

tom 1
i 1
better 1
go 1
well 1
go 1
longwhos 1
hendering 1
you 1
huck 1
began 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
his 1
scattered 1
clothes 1
he 1
said 1
tom 1
i 1
wisht 1
youd 1
come 1
too 1
now 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
over 1
well 1
wait 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
shore 1
well 1
youll 1
wait 1
a 1
blame 1
long 1
time 1
thats 1
all 1
huck 1
started 1
sorrowfully 1
away 1
and 1
tom 1
stood 1
looking 1
after 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
tugging 1
at 1
his 1
heart 1
to 1
yield 1
his 1
pride 1
and 1
go 1
along 1
too 1
he 1
hoped 1
the 1
boys 1
would 1
stop 1
but 1
they 1
still 1
waded 1
slowly 1
on 1
it 1
suddenly 1
dawned 1
on 1
tom 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
become 1
very 1
lonely 1
and 1
still 1
he 1
made 1
one 1
final 1
struggle 1
with 1
his 1
pride 1
and 1
then 1
darted 1
after 1
his 1
comrades 1
yelling 1
wait 1
wait 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
they 1
presently 1
stopped 1
and 1
turned 1
around 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
he 1
began 1
unfolding 1
his 1
secret 1
and 1
they 1
listened 1
moodily 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
driving 1
at 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
warwhoop 1
of 1
applause 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
splendid 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
at 1
first 1
they 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
started 1
away 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
plausible 1
excuse 1
but 1
his 1
real 1
reason 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
secret 1
would 1
keep 1
them 1
with 1
him 1
any 1
very 1
great 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
meant 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
in 1
reserve 1
as 1
a 1
last 1
seduction 1
the 1
lads 1
came 1
gayly 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
at 1
their 1
sports 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
will 1
chattering 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
about 1
toms 1
stupendous 1
plan 1
and 1
admiring 1
the 1
genius 1
of 1
it 1
after 1
a 1
dainty 1
egg 1
and 1
fish 1
dinner 1
tom 1
said 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
smoke 1
now 1
joe 1
caught 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
too 1
so 1
huck 1
made 1
pipes 1
and 1
filled 1
them 1
these 1
novices 1
had 1
never 1
smoked 1
anything 1
before 1
but 1
cigars 1
made 1
of 1
grapevine 1
and 1
they 1
bit 1
the 1
tongue 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
considered 1
manly 1
anyway 1
now 1
they 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
elbows 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
puff 1
charily 1
and 1
with 1
slender 1
confidence 1
the 1
smoke 1
had 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
taste 1
and 1
they 1
gagged 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
tom 1
said 1
why 1
its 1
just 1
as 1
easy 1
if 1

oh 1
i 1
reckon 1
not 1
ill 1
just 1
_bet_ 1
they 1
will 1
so 1
the 1
talk 1
ran 1
on 1
but 1
presently 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
flag 1
a 1
trifle 1
and 1
grow 1
disjointed 1
the 1
silences 1
widened 1
the 1
expectoration 1
marvellously 1
increased 1
every 1
pore 1
inside 1
the 1
boys 1
cheeks 1
became 1
a 1
spouting 1
fountain 1
they 1
could 1
scarcely 1
bail 1
out 1
the 1
cellars 1
under 1
their 1
tongues 1
fast 1
enough 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
inundation 1
little 1
overflowings 1
down 1
their 1
throats 1
occurred 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
and 1
sudden 1
retchings 1
followed 1
every 1
time 1
both 1
boys 1
were 1
looking 1
very 1
pale 1
and 1
miserable 1
now 1
joes 1
pipe 1
dropped 1
from 1
his 1
nerveless 1
fingers 1
toms 1
followed 1
both 1
fountains 1
were 1
going 1
furiously 1
and 1
both 1
pumps 1
bailing 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
joe 1
said 1
feebly 1
ive 1
lost 1
my 1
knife 1
i 1
reckon 1
i 1
better 1
go 1
and 1
find 1
it 1
tom 1
said 1
with 1
quivering 1
lips 1
and 1
halting 1
utterance 1
ill 1
help 1
you 1
you 1
go 1
over 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
ill 1
hunt 1
around 1
by 1
the 1
spring 1
no 1
you 1
neednt 1
come 1
huckwe 1
can 1
find 1
it 1
so 1
huck 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
waited 1
an 1
hour 1
then 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
lonesome 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
comrades 1
they 1
were 1
wide 1
apart 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
both 1
very 1
pale 1
both 1
fast 1
asleep 1
but 1
something 1
informed 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
any 1
trouble 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
talkative 1
at 1
supper 1
that 1
night 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
humble 1
look 1
and 1
when 1
huck 1
prepared 1
his 1
pipe 1
after 1
the 1
meal 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
prepare 1
theirs 1
they 1
said 1
no 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
feeling 1
very 1
wellsomething 1
they 1
ate 1
at 1
dinner 1
had 1
disagreed 1
with 1
them 1
about 1
midnight 1
joe 1
awoke 1
and 1
called 1
the 1
boys 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
brooding 1
oppressiveness 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
bode 1
something 1
the 1
boys 1
huddled 1
themselves 1
together 1
and 1
sought 1
the 1
friendly 1
companionship 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
though 1
the 1
dull 1
dead 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
breathless 1
atmosphere 1
was 1
stifling 1
they 1
sat 1
still 1
intent 1
and 1
waiting 1
the 1
solemn 1
hush 1
continued 1
beyond 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1

there 1
came 1
a 1
quivering 1
glow 1
that 1
vaguely 1
revealed 1
the 1

for 1
a 1
moment 1

then 1

by 1

another 1
then 1
a 1
faint 1
moan 1
came 1

through 1
the 1

puts 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
charming 1
in 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
work 1
the 1
consequence 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
nothing 1
left 1
for 1
life 1
but 1
his 1
prejudices 1
his 1
principles 1
and 1
his 1

good 1
artists 1
exist 1
simply 1
in 1
what 1
they 1

consequently 1
are 1
perfectly 1

a 1
really 1
great 1
poet 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
unpoetical 1
of 1
all 1
creatures 1
but 1
inferior 1
poets 1
are 1
absolutely 1
fascinating 1
the 1

are 1

out 1
of 1

waiting 1

dont 1

goodbye 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
lord 1
henrys 1
heavy 1
eyelids 1
drooped 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
certainly 1
few 1
people 1
had 1
ever 1
interested 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
dorian 1
gray 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
lads 1
mad 1
adoration 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
caused 1
him 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
pang 1
of 1
annoyance 1
or 1
jealousy 1
he 1
was 1
pleased 1
by 1
it 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
more 1
interesting 1
study 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
always 1
enthralled 1
by 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
but 1
the 1
ordinary 1
subjectmatter 1
of 1
that 1
science 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
trivial 1
and 1
of 1
no 1
import 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
begun 1
by 1
vivisecting 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
ended 1
by 1
vivisecting 1
others 1
human 1
lifethat 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
worth 1
investigating 1
compared 1
to 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
of 1
any 1
value 1
it 1
was 1
true 1
that 1
as 1
one 1
watched 1
life 1
in 1
its 1
curious 1
crucible 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
pleasure 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
wear 1
over 1
ones 1
face 1
a 1
mask 1
of 1
glass 1
nor 1
keep 1
the 1
sulphurous 1
fumes 1
from 1
troubling 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
making 1
the 1
imagination 1
turbid 1
with 1
monstrous 1
fancies 1
and 1
misshapen 1
dreams 1
there 1
were 1
poisons 1
so 1
subtle 1
that 1
to 1
know 1
their 1
properties 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
sicken 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
were 1
maladies 1
so 1
strange 1
that 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
them 1
if 1
one 1
sought 1
to 1
understand 1
their 1
nature 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
a 1
great 1
reward 1
one 1
received 1
how 1
wonderful 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
became 1
to 1
one 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
curious 1
hard 1
logic 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
the 1
emotional 1
coloured 1

of 1
the 1

where 1
they 1
met 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
separated 1
at 1

point 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
unison 1
and 1
at 1
what 1
point 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
discordthere 1
was 1
a 1
delight 1
in 1
that 1
what 1

was 1

never 1

too 1
high 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
any 1
sensation 1
he 1
was 1
consciousand 1
the 1
thought 1
brought 1
a 1
gleam 1
of 1
pleasure 1
into 1
his 1
brown 1
agate 1
eyesthat 1
it 1
was 1
through 1
certain 1
words 1
of 1
his 1
musical 1
words 1
said 1
with 1
musical 1
utterance 1
that 1
dorian 1
grays 1
soul 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
this 1
white 1
girl 1
and 1
bowed 1
in 1
worship 1
before 1
her 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
extent 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
creation 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
premature 1
that 1
was 1
something 1
ordinary 1
people 1
waited 1
till 1
life 1
disclosed 1
to 1
them 1
its 1
secrets 1
but 1
to 1
the 1
few 1
to 1
the 1
elect 1
the 1
mysteries 1
of 1
life 1
were 1
revealed 1
before 1
the 1
veil 1
was 1
drawn 1
away 1
sometimes 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
art 1
and 1
chiefly 1
of 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
literature 1
which 1
dealt 1
immediately 1
with 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
the 1
intellect 1
but 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
complex 1
personality 1
took 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
assumed 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
art 1
was 1
indeed 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
a 1
real 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
life 1
having 1
its 1
elaborate 1
masterpieces 1
just 1
as 1
poetry 1
has 1
or 1
sculpture 1
or 1
painting 1
yes 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
premature 1
he 1
was 1
gathering 1
his 1
harvest 1
while 1
it 1
was 1
yet 1
spring 1
the 1
pulse 1
and 1
passion 1
of 1
youth 1
were 1
in 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
becoming 1
selfconscious 1
it 1
was 1
delightful 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
beautiful 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
beautiful 1
soul 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
wonder 1
at 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
it 1
all 1
ended 1
or 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
end 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
gracious 1
figures 1
in 1
a 1
pageant 1
or 1
a 1
play 1
whose 1
joys 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
remote 1
from 1
one 1
but 1
whose 1
sorrows 1
stir 1
ones 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
whose 1
wounds 1
are 1
like 1
red 1
roses 1
soul 1
and 1
body 1
body 1
and 1
soulhow 1
mysterious 1
they 1
were 1
there 1
was 1
animalism 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
its 1
moments 1
of 1
spirituality 1
the 1
senses 1
could 1
refine 1
and 1
the 1
intellect 1
could 1
degrade 1
who 1
could 1
say 1
where 1
the 1
fleshly 1
impulse 1
ceased 1
or 1
the 1
psychical 1
impulse 1
began 1
how 1
shallow 1
were 1
the 1
arbitrary 1
definitions 1
of 1
ordinary 1
psychologists 1
and 1
yet 1
how 1
difficult 1
to 1
decide 1
between 1
the 1
claims 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
schools 1
was 1
the 1
soul 1
a 1
shadow 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
sin 1
or 1
was 1
the 1
body 1
really 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
as 1
giordano 1
bruno 1
thought 1
the 1
separation 1
of 1
spirit 1
from 1
matter 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
and 1
the 1
union 1
of 1
spirit 1
with 1
matter 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
also 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
whether 1
we 1
could 1
ever 1
make 1
psychology 1
so 1
absolute 1
a 1
science 1
that 1
each 1
little 1
spring 1
of 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
revealed 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
we 1
always 1
misunderstood 1
ourselves 1
and 1
rarely 1
understood 1
others 1
experience 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
ethical 1
value 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
name 1
men 1
gave 1
to 1
their 1
mistakes 1
moralists 1
had 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
regarded 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
warning 1
had 1
claimed 1
for 1
it 1
a 1
certain 1
ethical 1
efficacy 1
in 1
the 1
formation 1
of 1
character 1
had 1
praised 1
it 1
as 1
something 1
that 1
taught 1
us 1
what 1
to 1
follow 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
what 1
to 1
avoid 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
motive 1
power 1
in 1
experience 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
little 1
of 1
an 1
active 1
cause 1
as 1
conscience 1
itself 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
really 1
demonstrated 1
was 1
that 1
our 1
future 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
our 1
past 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
sin 1
we 1
had 1
done 1
once 1
and 1
with 1
loathing 1
we 1
would 1
do 1
many 1
times 1
and 1
with 1
joy 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
experimental 1
method 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
method 1
by 1
which 1
one 1
could 1
arrive 1
at 1
any 1
scientific 1
analysis 1
of 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
certainly 1
dorian 1
gray 1
was 1
a 1
subject 1
made 1
to 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
promise 1
rich 1
and 1
fruitful 1
results 1
his 1
sudden 1
mad 1
love 1
for 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
was 1
a 1
psychological 1
phenomenon 1
of 1
no 1
small 1
interest 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
curiosity 1
had 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
curiosity 1
and 1
the 1
desire 1
for 1
new 1
experiences 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
simple 1
but 1
rather 1
a 1
very 1
complex 1
passion 1
what 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
purely 1
sensuous 1
instinct 1
of 1
boyhood 1
had 1
been 1
transformed 1
by 1
the 1
workings 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
changed 1
into 1
something 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
the 1
lad 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
remote 1
from 1
sense 1
and 1
was 1
for 1
that 1
very 1
reason 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
dangerous 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
passions 1
about 1
whose 1
origin 1
we 1
deceived 1
ourselves 1
that 1
tyrannized 1
most 1
strongly 1
over 1
us 1
our 1
weakest 1
motives 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
whose 1
nature 1
we 1
were 1
conscious 1
it 1
often 1
happened 1
that 1
when 1
we 1
thought 1
we 1
were 1
experimenting 1
on 1
others 1
we 1
were 1
really 1
experimenting 1
on 1
ourselves 1
while 1
lord 1
henry 1
sat 1
dreaming 1
on 1
these 1
things 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
his 1
valet 1
entered 1
and 1
reminded 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
dinner 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
the 1
sunset 1
had 1
smitten 1
into 1
scarlet 1
gold 1
the 1
upper 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
opposite 1
the 1
panes 1
glowed 1
like 1
plates 1
of 1
heated 1
metal 1
the 1
sky 1
above 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
faded 1
rose 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
young 1
fierycoloured 1
life 1
and 1
wondered 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
going 1
to 1
end 1
when 1
he 1
arrived 1
home 1
about 1
halfpast 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
telegram 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
hall 1
table 1
he 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
dorian 1
gray 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1

with 1

to 1

i 1

the 1

querulously 1
sibyl 1

her 1

then 1
she 1
paused 1
a 1
rose 1
shook 1
in 1

and 1
shadowed 1
her 1
cheeks 1
quick 1
breath 1
parted 1
the 1
petals 1
of 1
her 1
lips 1
they 1
trembled 1
some 1
southern 1
wind 1
of 1
passion 1
swept 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
stirred 1
the 1
dainty 1
folds 1
of 1
her 1

said 1

the 1

flung 1
in 1

the 1

of 1
a 1
caged 1
bird 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
her 1
eyes 1
caught 1
the 1
melody 1
and 1
echoed 1
it 1
in 1
radiance 1
then 1
closed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
hide 1
their 1
secret 1
when 1
they 1
opened 1
the 1
mist 1
of 1
a 1
dream 1
had 1
passed 1
across 1
them 1
thinlipped 1
wisdom 1
spoke 1
at 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
worn 1
chair 1
hinted 1
at 1
prudence 1
quoted 1
from 1
that 1
book 1
of 1
cowardice 1
whose 1
author 1
apes 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
common 1
sense 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
listen 1
she 1
was 1
free 1
in 1
her 1
prison 1
of 1
passion 1
her 1
prince 1
prince 1
charming 1
was 1
with 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
called 1
on 1
memory 1
to 1
remake 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
sent 1
her 1
soul 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
his 1
kiss 1
burned 1
again 1
upon 1
her 1
mouth 1
her 1
eyelids 1
were 1
warm 1
with 1
his 1
breath 1
then 1
wisdom 1
altered 1
its 1
method 1
and 1
spoke 1
of 1
espial 1
and 1
discovery 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
might 1
be 1
rich 1
if 1
so 1
marriage 1
should 1
be 1
thought 1
of 1
against 1
the 1
shell 1
of 1
her 1
ear 1
broke 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
worldly 1
cunning 1
the 1
arrows 1
of 1
craft 1
shot 1
by 1
her 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
thin 1
lips 1
moving 1
and 1
smiled 1
suddenly 1
she 1
felt 1
the 1
need 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
wordy 1
silence 1
troubled 1
her 1
mother 1
mother 1
she 1
cried 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
love 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
i 1
know 1
why 1
i 1
love 1
him 1
i 1
love 1
him 1
because 1
he 1
is 1
like 1
what 1
love 1
himself 1
should 1
be 1
but 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
see 1
in 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
worthy 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
yetwhy 1
i 1
cannot 1
tellthough 1
i 1
feel 1
so 1
much 1
beneath 1
him 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
humble 1
i 1
feel 1
proud 1
terribly 1
proud 1
mother 1
did 1
you 1
love 1
my 1
father 1
as 1
i 1
love 1
prince 1
charming 1
the 1
elder 1
woman 1
grew 1
pale 1
beneath 1
the 1
coarse 1
powder 1
that 1
daubed 1
her 1
cheeks 1
and 1
her 1
dry 1
lips 1
twitched 1
with 1
a 1
spasm 1
of 1
pain 1
sybil 1
rushed 1
to 1
her 1
flung 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
her 1
forgive 1
me 1
mother 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
pains 1
you 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
our 1
father 1
but 1
it 1
only 1
pains 1
you 1
because 1
you 1
loved 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
dont 1
look 1
so 1
sad 1
i 1
am 1
as 1
happy 1
today 1
as 1
you 1
were 1
twenty 1
years 1
ago 1
ah 1
let 1
me 1
be 1
happy 1
for 1
ever 1
my 1
child 1
you 1
are 1
far 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
falling 1
in 1
love 1
besides 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
of 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
you 1
dont 1
even 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
most 1
inconvenient 1
and 1
really 1
when 1
james 1
is 1
going 1
away 1
to 1
australia 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
shown 1
more 1
consideration 1
however 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
before 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
rich 1
ah 1
mother 1
mother 1
let 1
me 1
be 1
happy 1
mrs 1
vane 1
glanced 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
false 1
theatrical 1
gestures 1
that 1
so 1
often 1
become 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
second 1
nature 1
to 1
a 1
stageplayer 1
clasped 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lad 1
with 1
rough 1
brown 1
hair 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
was 1
thickset 1
of 1
figure 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
were 1
large 1
and 1
somewhat 1
clumsy 1
in 1
movement 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
finely 1
bred 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
one 1
would 1
hardly 1
have 1
guessed 1
the 1
close 1
relationship 1
that 1
existed 1
between 1
them 1
mrs 1
vane 1
fixed 1
her 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
intensified 1
her 1
smile 1
she 1
mentally 1
elevated 1
her 1
son 1
to 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
an 1
audience 1
she 1
felt 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
_tableau_ 1
was 1
interesting 1
you 1
might 1
keep 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
kisses 1
for 1
me 1
sibyl 1
i 1
think 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
with 1
a 1
goodnatured 1
grumble 1
ah 1
but 1
you 1
dont 1
like 1
being 1
kissed 1
jim 1
she 1
cried 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
dreadful 1
old 1
bear 1
and 1
she 1
ran 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
hugged 1
him 1
james 1
vane 1
looked 1
into 1
his 1
sisters 1
face 1
with 1
tenderness 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
sibyl 1
i 1
dont 1
suppose 1
i 1
shall 1
ever 1
see 1
this 1
horrid 1
london 1
again 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
my 1
son 1
dont 1
say 1
such 1
dreadful 1
things 1
murmured 1
mrs 1
vane 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
tawdry 1
theatrical 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
beginning 1
to 1
patch 1
it 1
she 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
disappointed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
joined 1
the 1
group 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
increased 1
the 1
theatrical 1
picturesqueness 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
why 1
not 1
mother 1
i 1
mean 1
it 1
you 1
pain 1
me 1
my 1
son 1
i 1
trust 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
from 1
australia 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
of 1
affluence 1
i 1
believe 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
society 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
in 1
the 1
coloniesnothing 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
call 1
societyso 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
fortune 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
assert 1
yourself 1
in 1
london 1
society 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
money 1
to 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
sibyl 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
i 1
hate 1
it 1
oh 1
jim 1
said 1
sibyl 1
laughing 1
how 1
unkind 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
are 1
you 1
really 1
going 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
nice 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
friendsto 1
tom 1
hardy 1
who 1
gave 1
you 1
that 1
hideous 1
pipe 1
or 1
ned 1
langton 1
who 1
makes 1
fun 1
of 1
you 1
for 1
smoking 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
sweet 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
your 1
last 1
afternoon 1
where 1
shall 1
we 1
go 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
shabby 1
he 1
answered 1
frowning 1
only 1
swell 1
people 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
nonsense 1
jim 1
she 1
whispered 1
stroking 1
the 1
sleeve 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
very 1
well 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
but 1
dont 1
be 1
too 1
long 1
dressing 1
she 1
danced 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
one 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
singing 1
as 1
she 1
ran 1
upstairs 1
her 1
little 1
feet 1
pattered 1
overhead 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
still 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
mother 1
are 1
my 1
things 1
ready 1
he 1
asked 1
quite 1
ready 1
james 1
she 1
answered 1
keeping 1
her 1
eyes 1
on 1
her 1
work 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
past 1
she 1
had 1
felt 1
ill 1
at 1
ease 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alone 1
with 1
this 1
rough 1
stern 1
son 1
of 1
hers 1
her 1
shallow 1
secret 1
nature 1
was 1
troubled 1
when 1
their 1
eyes 1
met 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
suspected 1
anything 1
the 1
silence 1
for 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
other 1
observation 1
became 1
intolerable 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
complain 1
women 1
defend 1
themselves 1
by 1
attacking 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
attack 1
by 1
sudden 1
and 1
strange 1
surrenders 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
contented 1
james 1
with 1
your 1
seafaring 1
life 1
she 1
said 1
you 1
must 1
remember 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
choice 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
entered 1
a 1
solicitors 1
office 1
solicitors 1
are 1
a 1
very 1
respectable 1
class 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
often 1
dine 1
with 1
the 1
best 1
families 1
i 1
hate 1
offices 1
and 1
i 1
hate 1
clerks 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
i 1
have 1
chosen 1
my 1
own 1
life 1
all 1
i 1
say 1
is 1
watch 1
over 1
sibyl 1
dont 1
let 1
her 1
come 1
to 1
any 1
harm 1
mother 1
you 1
must 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
james 1
you 1
really 1
talk 1
very 1
strangely 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
watch 1
over 1
sibyl 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
gentleman 1
comes 1
every 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
goes 1
behind 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
her 1
is 1
that 1
right 1
what 1
about 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
speaking 1
about 1
things 1
you 1
dont 1
understand 1
james 1
in 1
the 1
profession 1
we 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
most 1
gratifying 1
attention 1
i 1
myself 1
used 1
to 1
receive 1
many 1
bouquets 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
was 1
when 1
acting 1
was 1
really 1
understood 1
as 1
for 1
sibyl 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
present 1
whether 1
her 1
attachment 1
is 1
serious 1
or 1
not 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
in 1
question 1
is 1
a 1
perfect 1
gentleman 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
most 1
polite 1
to 1
me 1
besides 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
being 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
he 1
sends 1
are 1
lovely 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
though 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
harshly 1
no 1
answered 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
a 1
placid 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
yet 1
revealed 1
his 1
real 1
name 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
romantic 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
is 1
probably 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
james 1
vane 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
watch 1
over 1
sibyl 1
mother 1
he 1
cried 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
my 1
son 1
you 1
distress 1
me 1
very 1
much 1
sibyl 1
is 1
always 1
under 1
my 1
special 1
care 1
of 1
course 1
if 1
this 1
gentleman 1
is 1
wealthy 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
should 1
not 1
contract 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
trust 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
he 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
brilliant 1
marriage 1
for 1
sibyl 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
charming 1
couple 1
his 1
good 1
looks 1
are 1
really 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
everybody 1
notices 1
them 1
the 1
lad 1
muttered 1
something 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
drummed 1
on 1
the 1
windowpane 1
with 1
his 1
coarse 1
fingers 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
turned 1
round 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
sibyl 1
ran 1
in 1
how 1
serious 1
you 1
both 1
are 1
she 1
cried 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
nothing 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
suppose 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
sometimes 1
goodbye 1
mother 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
my 1
dinner 1
at 1
five 1
oclock 1
everything 1
is 1
packed 1
except 1
my 1
shirts 1
so 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
trouble 1
goodbye 1
my 1
son 1
she 1
answered 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
of 1
strained 1
stateliness 1
she 1
was 1
extremely 1
annoyed 1
at 1
the 1
tone 1
he 1
had 1
adopted 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
look 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
her 1
feel 1
afraid 1
kiss 1
me 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
girl 1
her 1
flowerlike 1
lips 1
touched 1
the 1
withered 1
cheek 1
and 1
warmed 1
its 1
frost 1
my 1
child 1
my 1
child 1
cried 1
mrs 1
vane 1
looking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
an 1
imaginary 1
gallery 1
come 1
sibyl 1
said 1
her 1
brother 1
impatiently 1
he 1
hated 1
his 1
mothers 1
affectations 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
flickering 1
windblown 1
sunlight 1
and 1
strolled 1
down 1
the 1
dreary 1
euston 1
road 1
the 1
passersby 1
glanced 1
in 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
sullen 1
heavy 1
youth 1
who 1
in 1
coarse 1
illfitting 1
clothes 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
graceful 1
refinedlooking 1
girl 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
common 1
gardener 1
walking 1
with 1
a 1
rose 1
jim 1
frowned 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
caught 1
the 1
inquisitive 1
glance 1
of 1
some 1
stranger 1
he 1
had 1
that 1
dislike 1
of 1
being 1
stared 1
at 1
which 1
comes 1
on 1
geniuses 1
late 1
in 1
life 1
and 1
never 1
leaves 1
the 1
commonplace 1
sibyl 1
however 1
was 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
effect 1
she 1
was 1
producing 1
her 1
love 1
was 1
trembling 1
in 1
laughter 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
she 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
prince 1
charming 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
talk 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
prattled 1
on 1
about 1
the 1
ship 1
in 1
which 1
jim 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
sail 1
about 1
the 1
gold 1
he 1
was 1
certain 1
to 1
find 1
about 1
the 1
wonderful 1
heiress 1
whose 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
save 1
from 1
the 1
wicked 1
redshirted 1
bushrangers 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
sailor 1
or 1
a 1
supercargo 1
or 1
whatever 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
oh 1
no 1
a 1
sailors 1
existence 1
was 1
dreadful 1
fancy 1
being 1
cooped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
horrid 1
ship 1
with 1
the 1
hoarse 1
humpbacked 1
waves 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
wind 1
blowing 1
the 1
masts 1
down 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
sails 1
into 1
long 1
screaming 1
ribands 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
vessel 1
at 1
melbourne 1
bid 1
a 1
polite 1
goodbye 1
to 1
the 1
captain 1
and 1
go 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
goldfields 1
before 1
a 1
week 1
was 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
across 1
a 1
large 1
nugget 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
the 1
largest 1
nugget 1
that 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
discovered 1
and 1
bring 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
in 1
a 1
waggon 1
guarded 1
by 1
six 1
mounted 1
policemen 1
the 1
bushrangers 1
were 1
to 1
attack 1
them 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
be 1
defeated 1
with 1
immense 1
slaughter 1
or 1
no 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
goldfields 1
at 1
all 1
they 1
were 1
horrid 1
places 1
where 1
men 1
got 1
intoxicated 1
and 1
shot 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
barrooms 1
and 1
used 1
bad 1
language 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
sheepfarmer 1
and 1
one 1
evening 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
home 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
beautiful 1
heiress 1
being 1
carried 1
off 1
by 1
a 1
robber 1
on 1
a 1
black 1
horse 1
and 1
give 1
chase 1
and 1
rescue 1
her 1
of 1
course 1
she 1
would 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
get 1
married 1
and 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
immense 1
house 1
in 1
london 1
yes 1
there 1
were 1
delightful 1
things 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
not 1
lose 1
his 1
temper 1
or 1
spend 1
his 1
money 1
foolishly 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
year 1
older 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
she 1
knew 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
sure 1
also 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
every 1
mail 1
and 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
prayers 1
each 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
god 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
would 1
watch 1
over 1
him 1
she 1
would 1
pray 1
for 1
him 1
too 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
quite 1
rich 1
and 1
happy 1
the 1
lad 1
listened 1
sulkily 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
he 1
was 1
heartsick 1
at 1
leaving 1
home 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
this 1
alone 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
gloomy 1
and 1
morose 1
inexperienced 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
had 1
still 1
a 1
strong 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
sibyls 1
position 1
this 1
young 1
dandy 1
who 1
was 1
making 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
could 1
mean 1
her 1
no 1
good 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
and 1
he 1
hated 1
him 1
for 1
that 1
hated 1
him 1
through 1
some 1
curious 1
raceinstinct 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
and 1
which 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
dominant 1
within 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
conscious 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
shallowness 1
and 1
vanity 1
of 1
his 1
mothers 1
nature 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
saw 1
infinite 1
peril 1
for 1
sibyl 1
and 1
sibyls 1
happiness 1
children 1
begin 1
by 1
loving 1
their 1
parents 1
as 1
they 1
grow 1
older 1
they 1
judge 1
them 1
sometimes 1
they 1
forgive 1
them 1
his 1
mother 1
he 1
had 1
something 1
on 1
his 1
mind 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
her 1
something 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brooded 1
on 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
of 1
silence 1
a 1
chance 1
phrase 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
a 1
whispered 1
sneer 1
that 1
had 1
reached 1
his 1
ears 1
one 1
night 1
as 1
he 1
waited 1
at 1
the 1
stagedoor 1
had 1
set 1
loose 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
horrible 1
thoughts 1
he 1
remembered 1
it 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
lash 1
of 1
a 1
huntingcrop 1
across 1
his 1
face 1
his 1
brows 1
knit 1
together 1
into 1
a 1
wedgelike 1
furrow 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
twitch 1
of 1
pain 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
underlip 1
you 1

not 1
listening 1
to 1
a 1

at 1
him 1

shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1

laughed 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
arm 1
you 1
dear 1
old 1
jim 1
you 1
talk 1
as 1
if 1
you 1

a 1
hundred 1
some 1
day 1
you 1

love 1
yourself 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
dont 1
look 1
so 1
sulky 1
surely 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
though 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
away 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
happier 1
than 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
before 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
hard 1
for 1
us 1
both 1
terribly 1
hard 1
and 1
difficult 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
different 1
now 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
a 1
new 1
world 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
one 1
here 1
are 1
two 1
chairs 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
smart 1
people 1
go 1
by 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
seats 1
amidst 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
watchers 1
the 1
tulipbeds 1
across 1
the 1
road 1
flamed 1
like 1
throbbing 1
rings 1
of 1
fire 1
a 1
white 1
dusttremulous 1
cloud 1
of 1
orrisroot 1
it 1
seemedhung 1
in 1
the 1
panting 1
air 1
the 1
brightly 1
coloured 1
parasols 1
danced 1
and 1
dipped 1
like 1
monstrous 1
butterflies 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
brother 1
talk 1
of 1
himself 1
his 1
hopes 1
his 1
prospects 1
he 1
spoke 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
effort 1
they 1
passed 1
words 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
players 1
at 1
a 1
game 1
pass 1
counters 1
sibyl 1
felt 1
oppressed 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
communicate 1
her 1
joy 1
a 1
faint 1
smile 1
curving 1
that 1
sullen 1
mouth 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
echo 1
she 1
could 1
win 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
she 1
became 1
silent 1
suddenly 1
she 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
golden 1
hair 1
and 1
laughing 1
lips 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
open 1
carriage 1
with 1
two 1
ladies 1
dorian 1
gray 1
drove 1
past 1
she 1
started 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
she 1
cried 1
who 1
said 1
jim 1
vane 1
prince 1
charming 1
she 1
answered 1
looking 1
after 1
the 1
victoria 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
seized 1
her 1
roughly 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
show 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
is 1
he 1
point 1
him 1
out 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
the 1
duke 1
of 1
berwicks 1
fourinhand 1
came 1
between 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
space 1
clear 1
the 1
carriage 1
had 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
park 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
murmured 1
sibyl 1
sadly 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
for 1

in 1
heaven 1
if 1
he 1
ever 1
does 1
you 1
any 1
wrong 1
i 1
shall 1
kill 1
him 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
horror 1
he 1
repeated 1
his 1
words 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
a 1
dagger 1
the 1
people 1
round 1
began 1
to 1
gape 1
a 1
lady 1
standing 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
tittered 1
come 1
away 1
jim 1

away 1
she 1
whispered 1
he 1
followed 1
her 1
doggedly 1
as 1
she 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
he 1
felt 1
glad 1
at 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
achilles 1
statue 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
there 1
was 1
pity 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
became 1
laughter 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
at 1
him 1

had 1
better 1
she 1
shrank 1
from 1
him 1
then 1
she 1
laughed 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
he 1
was 1
merely 1
a 1
boy 1
at 1
the 1
marble 1
arch 1
they 1
hailed 1
an 1
omnibus 1
which 1
left 1
them 1
close 1
to 1
their 1
shabby 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
euston 1
road 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
five 1
oclock 1
and 1
sibyl 1
had 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
before 1
acting 1
jim 1
insisted 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
sooner 1
part 1
with 1
her 1
when 1
their 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
present 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
and 1
he 1
detested 1
scenes 1
of 1
every 1
kind 1
in 1
sybils 1
own 1
room 1
they 1
parted 1
there 1
was 1
jealousy 1
in 1
the 1
lads 1
heart 1
and 1
a 1
fierce 1
murderous 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
who 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
them 1
yet 1
when 1
her 1
arms 1
were 1
flung 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
strayed 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
he 1
softened 1
and 1
kissed 1
her 1
with 1
real 1
affection 1
there 1
were 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
downstairs 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
below 1
she 1
grumbled 1
at 1
his 1
unpunctuality 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
meagre 1
meal 1
the 1
flies 1
buzzed 1
round 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
crawled 1
over 1
the 1
stained 1
cloth 1
through 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
omnibuses 1
and 1
the 1
clatter 1
of 1
streetcabs 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
droning 1
voice 1
devouring 1
each 1
minute 1
that 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
him 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
thrust 1
away 1
his 1
plate 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
it 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
he 1
suspected 1
leaden 1
with 1
fear 1
his 1
mother 1
watched 1
him 1
words 1
dropped 1
mechanically 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
a 1
tattered 1
lace 1
handkerchief 1
twitched 1
in 1
her 1
fingers 1
when 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
six 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
their 1
eyes 1
met 1
in 1
hers 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
wild 1
appeal 1
for 1
mercy 1
it 1
enraged 1
him 1
mother 1
i 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
her 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
vaguely 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
truth 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
were 1
you 1
married 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
she 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
sigh 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
the 1
terrible 1
moment 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
for 1
weeks 1
and 1
months 1
she 1
had 1
dreaded 1
had 1
come 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
felt 1
no 1
terror 1
indeed 1
in 1
some 1
measure 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
disappointment 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
vulgar 1
directness 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
called 1
for 1
a 1
direct 1
answer 1
the 1
situation 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
gradually 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
was 1
crude 1
it 1
reminded 1
her 1
of 1
a 1
bad 1
rehearsal 1
no 1
she 1
answered 1
wondering 1
at 1
the 1
harsh 1
simplicity 1
of 1
life 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
scoundrel 1
then 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
clenching 1
his 1
fists 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
i 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
free 1
we 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
very 1
much 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
provision 1
for 1
us 1
dont 1
speak 1
against 1
him 1
my 1
son 1
he 1
was 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
a 1
gentleman 1
indeed 1
he 1
was 1
highly 1
connected 1
an 1
oath 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
for 1
myself 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
but 1
dont 1
let 1
sibyl 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
gentleman 1
isnt 1
it 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
or 1
says 1
he 1
is 1
highly 1
connected 1
too 1
i 1
suppose 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
a 1
hideous 1
sense 1
of 1
humiliation 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
woman 1
her 1
head 1
drooped 1
she 1
wiped 1
her 1
eyes 1
with 1
shaking 1
hands 1
sibyl 1
has 1
a 1
mother 1
she 1
murmured 1
i 1
had 1
none 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
touched 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
her 1
and 1
stooping 1
down 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
pained 1
you 1
by 1
asking 1
about 1
my 1
father 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
now 1
goodbye 1
dont 1
forget 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
now 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
and 1
believe 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
this 1
man 1
wrongs 1
my 1
sister 1
i 1
will 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
track 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
i 1
swear 1
it 1
the 1
exaggerated 1
folly 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
the 1
passionate 1
gesture 1
that 1
accompanied 1
it 1
the 1
mad 1
melodramatic 1
words 1
made 1
life 1
seem 1
more 1
vivid 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
she 1
breathed 1
more 1
freely 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
she 1
really 1
admired 1
her 1
son 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
continued 1
the 1
scene 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
emotional 1
scale 1
but 1
he 1
cut 1
her 1
short 1
trunks 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
down 1
and 1
mufflers 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
lodginghouse 1
drudge 1
bustled 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
bargaining 1
with 1
the 1
cabman 1
the 1
moment 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
vulgar 1
details 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
renewed 1
feeling 1
of 1
disappointment 1
that 1
she 1
waved 1
the 1
tattered 1
lace 1
handkerchief 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
as 1
her 1
son 1
drove 1
away 1
she 1
was 1
conscious 1
that 1
a 1
great 1
opportunity 1
had 1
been 1
wasted 1
she 1
consoled 1
herself 1
by 1
telling 1
sibyl 1
how 1
desolate 1
she 1
felt 1
her 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
she 1
remembered 1
the 1
phrase 1
it 1
had 1
pleased 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
it 1
was 1
vividly 1
and 1
dramatically 1
expressed 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
all 1
laugh 1
at 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
chapter 1
6 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
the 1
news 1
basil 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
that 1
evening 1
as 1
hallward 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
private 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
bristol 1
where 1
dinner 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
for 1
three 1
no 1
harry 1
answered 1
the 1
artist 1
giving 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
coat 1
to 1
the 1
bowing 1
waiter 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
nothing 1
about 1
politics 1
i 1
hope 1
they 1
dont 1
interest 1
me 1
there 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
single 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
commons 1
worth 1
painting 1
though 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
whitewashing 1
dorian 1
gray 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
watching 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
hallward 1
started 1
and 1
then 1
frowned 1
dorian 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
he 1
cried 1
impossible 1
it 1
is 1
perfectly 1
true 1
to 1
whom 1
to 1
some 1
little 1
actress 1
or 1
other 1
i 1
cant 1
believe 1
it 1
dorian 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
sensible 1
dorian 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
wise 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
foolish 1
things 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
marriage 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
do 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
harry 1
except 1
in 1
america 1
rejoined 1
lord 1
henry 1
languidly 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
say 1
he 1
was 1
married 1
i 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
distinct 1
remembrance 1
of 1
being 1
married 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
recollection 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
being 1
engaged 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
was 1
engaged 1
but 1
think 1
of 1
dorians 1
birth 1
and 1
position 1
and 1
wealth 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
absurd 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
marry 1
so 1
much 1
beneath 1
him 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
marry 1
this 1
girl 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
basil 1
he 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
then 1
whenever 1
a 1
man 1
does 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
stupid 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
from 1
the 1
noblest 1
motives 1
i 1
hope 1
the 1
girl 1
is 1
good 1
harry 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
dorian 1
tied 1
to 1
some 1
vile 1
creature 1
who 1
might 1
degrade 1
his 1
nature 1
and 1
ruin 1
his 1
intellect 1
oh 1
she 1
is 1
better 1
than 1
goodshe 1
is 1
beautiful 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
sipping 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
vermouth 1
and 1
orangebitters 1
dorian 1
says 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
often 1
wrong 1
about 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
your 1
portrait 1
of 1
him 1
has 1
quickened 1
his 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
personal 1
appearance 1
of 1
other 1
people 1
it 1
has 1
had 1
that 1
excellent 1
effect 1
amongst 1
others 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
tonight 1
if 1
that 1
boy 1
doesnt 1
forget 1
his 1
appointment 1
are 1
you 1
serious 1
quite 1
serious 1
basil 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
miserable 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
more 1
serious 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
but 1
do 1
you 1
approve 1
of 1
it 1
harry 1
asked 1
the 1
painter 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
you 1
cant 1
approve 1
of 1
it 1
possibly 1
it 1
is 1
some 1
silly 1
infatuation 1
i 1
never 1
approve 1
or 1
disapprove 1
of 1
anything 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
absurd 1
attitude 1
to 1
take 1
towards 1
life 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
sent 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
air 1
our 1
moral 1
prejudices 1
i 1
never 1
take 1
any 1
notice 1
of 1
what 1
common 1
people 1
say 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
interfere 1
with 1
what 1
charming 1
people 1
do 1
if 1
a 1
personality 1
fascinates 1
me 1
whatever 1
mode 1
of 1
expression 1
that 1
personality 1
selects 1
is 1
absolutely 1
delightful 1
to 1
me 1
dorian 1
gray 1
falls 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
a 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
who 1
acts 1
juliet 1
and 1
proposes 1
to 1
marry 1
her 1
why 1
not 1
if 1
he 1
wedded 1
messalina 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
interesting 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
champion 1
of 1
marriage 1
the 1
real 1
drawback 1
to 1
marriage 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
makes 1
one 1
unselfish 1
and 1
unselfish 1
people 1
are 1
colourless 1
they 1
lack 1
individuality 1
still 1
there 1
are 1
certain 1
temperaments 1
that 1
marriage 1
makes 1
more 1
complex 1
they 1
retain 1
their 1
egotism 1
and 1
add 1
to 1
it 1
many 1
other 1
egos 1
they 1
are 1
forced 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
life 1
they 1
become 1
more 1
highly 1
organized 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
highly 1
organized 1
is 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
mans 1
existence 1
besides 1
every 1
experience 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
and 1
whatever 1
one 1
may 1
say 1
against 1
marriage 1
it 1
is 1
certainly 1
an 1
experience 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
dorian 1
gray 1
will 1
make 1
this 1
girl 1
his 1
wife 1
passionately 1
adore 1
her 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
become 1
fascinated 1
by 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
wonderful 1
study 1
you 1
dont 1
mean 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
harry 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
dont 1
if 1
dorian 1
grays 1
life 1
were 1
spoiled 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
be 1
sorrier 1
than 1
yourself 1
you 1
are 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
lord 1
henry 1
laughed 1
the 1
reason 1
we 1
all 1
like 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
well 1
of 1
others 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
afraid 1
for 1
ourselves 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
optimism 1
is 1
sheer 1
terror 1
we 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
generous 1
because 1
we 1
credit 1
our 1
neighbour 1
with 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
those 1
virtues 1
that 1
are 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
benefit 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
praise 1
the 1
banker 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
overdraw 1
our 1
account 1
and 1
find 1
good 1
qualities 1
in 1
the 1
highwayman 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
spare 1
our 1
pockets 1
i 1
mean 1
everything 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
greatest 1
contempt 1
for 1
optimism 1
as 1
for 1
a 1
spoiled 1
life 1
no 1
life 1
is 1
spoiled 1
but 1
one 1
whose 1
growth 1
is 1
arrested 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
mar 1
a 1
nature 1
you 1
have 1
merely 1
to 1
reform 1
it 1
as 1
for 1
marriage 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
silly 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
and 1
more 1
interesting 1
bonds 1
between 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
i 1
will 1
certainly 1
encourage 1
them 1
they 1
have 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
being 1
fashionable 1
but 1
here 1
is 1
dorian 1
himself 1
he 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
my 1
dear 1
harry 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
you 1
must 1
both 1
congratulate 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
throwing 1
off 1
his 1
evening 1
cape 1
with 1
its 1
satinlined 1
wings 1
and 1
shaking 1
each 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
in 1
turn 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
so 1
happy 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
suddenall 1
really 1
delightful 1
things 1
are 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
looking 1
for 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
flushed 1
with 1
excitement 1
and 1
pleasure 1
and 1
looked 1
extraordinarily 1
handsome 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
dorian 1
said 1
hallward 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
quite 1
forgive 1
you 1
for 1
not 1
having 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
of 1
your 1
engagement 1
you 1
let 1
harry 1
know 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
forgive 1
you 1
for 1
being 1
late 1
for 1
dinner 1
broke 1
in 1
lord 1
henry 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
the 1
lads 1
shoulder 1
and 1
smiling 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
come 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
try 1
what 1
the 1
new 1
_chef_ 1
here 1
is 1
like 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
tell 1
us 1
how 1
it 1
all 1
came 1
about 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
tell 1
cried 1
dorian 1
as 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
seats 1
at 1
the 1
small 1
round 1
table 1
what 1
happened 1
was 1
simply 1
this 1
after 1
i 1
left 1
you 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
harry 1
i 1
dressed 1
had 1
some 1
dinner 1
at 1
that 1
little 1
italian 1
restaurant 1
in 1
rupert 1
street 1
you 1
introduced 1
me 1
to 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
at 1
eight 1
oclock 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
sibyl 1
was 1
playing 1
rosalind 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
scenery 1
was 1
dreadful 1
and 1
the 1
orlando 1
absurd 1
but 1
sibyl 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
on 1
in 1
her 1
boys 1
clothes 1
she 1
was 1
perfectly 1
wonderful 1
she 1
wore 1
a 1
mosscoloured 1
velvet 1
jerkin 1
with 1
cinnamon 1
sleeves 1
slim 1
brown 1
crossgartered 1
hose 1
a 1
dainty 1
little 1
green 1
cap 1
with 1
a 1
hawks 1
feather 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
jewel 1
and 1
a 1
hooded 1
cloak 1
lined 1
with 1
dull 1
red 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
more 1
exquisite 1
she 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
delicate 1
grace 1
of 1
that 1
tanagra 1
figurine 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
in 1
your 1
studio 1
basil 1
her 1
hair 1
clustered 1
round 1
her 1
face 1
like 1
dark 1
leaves 1
round 1
a 1
pale 1
rose 1
as 1
for 1
her 1
actingwell 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
her 1
tonight 1
she 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
born 1
artist 1
i 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
dingy 1
box 1
absolutely 1
enthralled 1
i 1
forgot 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
london 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
i 1
was 1
away 1
with 1
my 1
love 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
after 1
the 1
performance 1
was 1
over 1
i 1
went 1
behind 1
and 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
sitting 1
together 1
suddenly 1
there 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
eyes 1
a 1
look 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
there 1
before 1
my 1
lips 1
moved 1
towards 1
hers 1
we 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1
i 1
cant 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
what 1
i 1
felt 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
had 1
been 1
narrowed 1
to 1
one 1
perfect 1
point 1
of 1
rosecoloured 1
joy 1
she 1
trembled 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
shook 1
like 1
a 1
white 1
narcissus 1
then 1
she 1
flung 1
herself 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
kissed 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
this 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
our 1
engagement 1
is 1
a 1
dead 1
secret 1
she 1
has 1
not 1
even 1
told 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
my 1
guardians 1
will 1
say 1
lord 1
radley 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
furious 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
of 1
age 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
like 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
right 1
basil 1
havent 1
i 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
love 1
out 1
of 1
poetry 1
and 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
wife 1
in 1
shakespeares 1
plays 1
lips 1
that 1
shakespeare 1
taught 1
to 1
speak 1
have 1
whispered 1
their 1
secret 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
rosalind 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
kissed 1
juliet 1
on 1
the 1
mouth 1
yes 1
dorian 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
were 1
right 1
said 1
hallward 1
slowly 1
have 1
you 1
seen 1
her 1
today 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
dorian 1
gray 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
left 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
of 1
arden 1
i 1
shall 1
find 1
her 1
in 1
an 1
orchard 1
in 1
verona 1
lord 1
henry 1
sipped 1
his 1
champagne 1
in 1
a 1
meditative 1
manner 1
at 1
what 1
particular 1
point 1
did 1
you 1
mention 1
the 1
word 1
marriage 1
dorian 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
in 1
answer 1
perhaps 1
you 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
my 1
dear 1
harry 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
treat 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
business 1
transaction 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
any 1
formal 1
proposal 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
worthy 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
wife 1
not 1
worthy 1
why 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
compared 1
with 1
her 1
women 1
are 1
wonderfully 1
practical 1
murmured 1
lord 1
henry 1
much 1
more 1
practical 1
than 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
situations 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
we 1
often 1
forget 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
about 1
marriage 1
and 1
they 1
always 1
remind 1
us 1
hallward 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
dont 1
harry 1
you 1
have 1
annoyed 1
dorian 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
like 1
other 1
men 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
bring 1
misery 1
upon 1
any 1
one 1
his 1
nature 1
is 1
too 1
fine 1
for 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
looked 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
dorian 1
is 1
never 1
annoyed 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
asked 1
the 1
question 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
reason 1
possible 1
for 1
the 1
only 1
reason 1
indeed 1
that 1
excuses 1
one 1
for 1
asking 1
any 1
questionsimple 1
curiosity 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
theory 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
the 1
women 1
who 1
propose 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
not 1
we 1
who 1
propose 1
to 1
the 1
women 1
except 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
middleclass 1
life 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
middle 1
classes 1
are 1
not 1
modern 1
dorian 1
gray 1
laughed 1
and 1
tossed 1
his 1
head 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
incorrigible 1
harry 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
mind 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
be 1
angry 1
with 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
see 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
wrong 1
her 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
beast 1
a 1
beast 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
how 1
any 1
one 1
can 1
wish 1
to 1
shame 1
the 1
thing 1
he 1
loves 1
i 1
love 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
place 1
her 1
on 1
a 1
pedestal 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
worship 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
mine 1
what 1
is 1
marriage 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
vow 1
you 1
mock 1
at 1
it 1
for 1
that 1
ah 1
dont 1
mock 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
vow 1
that 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
trust 1
makes 1
me 1
faithful 1
her 1
belief 1
makes 1
me 1
good 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
with 1
her 1
i 1
regret 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
taught 1
me 1
i 1
become 1
different 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
known 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
i 1
am 1
changed 1
and 1
the 1
mere 1
touch 1
of 1
sibyl 1
vanes 1
hand 1
makes 1
me 1
forget 1
you 1
and 1
all 1
your 1
wrong 1
fascinating 1
poisonous 1
delightful 1
theories 1
and 1
those 1
are 1
asked 1
lord 1
henry 1
helping 1
himself 1
to 1
some 1
salad 1
oh 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
life 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
love 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
pleasure 1
all 1
your 1
theories 1
in 1
fact 1
harry 1
pleasure 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
a 1
theory 1
about 1
he 1
answered 1
in 1
his 1
slow 1
melodious 1
voice 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
cannot 1
claim 1
my 1
theory 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
nature 1
not 1
to 1
me 1
pleasure 1
is 1
natures 1
test 1
her 1
sign 1
of 1
approval 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
happy 1
we 1
are 1
always 1
good 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
good 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
happy 1
ah 1
but 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
good 1
cried 1
basil 1
hallward 1
yes 1
echoed 1
dorian 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
lord 1
henry 1
over 1
the 1
heavy 1
clusters 1
of 1
purplelipped 1
irises 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
good 1
harry 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
ones 1
self 1
he 1
replied 1
touching 1
the 1
thin 1
stem 1
of 1
his 1
glass 1
with 1
his 1
pale 1
finepointed 1
fingers 1
discord 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
others 1
ones 1
own 1
lifethat 1
is 1
the 1
important 1
thing 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
ones 1
neighbours 1
if 1
one 1
wishes 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
prig 1
or 1
a 1
puritan 1
one 1
can 1
flaunt 1
ones 1
moral 1
views 1
about 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
ones 1
concern 1
besides 1
individualism 1
has 1
really 1
the 1
higher 1
aim 1
modern 1
morality 1
consists 1
in 1
accepting 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
ones 1
age 1
i 1
consider 1
that 1
for 1
any 1
man 1
of 1
culture 1
to 1
accept 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
is 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
grossest 1
immorality 1
but 1
surely 1
if 1
one 1
lives 1
merely 1
for 1
ones 1
self 1
harry 1
one 1
pays 1
a 1
terrible 1
price 1
for 1
doing 1
so 1
suggested 1
the 1
painter 1
yes 1
we 1
are 1
overcharged 1
for 1
everything 1
nowadays 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
tragedy 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
afford 1
nothing 1
but 1
selfdenial 1
beautiful 1
sins 1
like 1
beautiful 1
things 1
are 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
one 1
has 1
to 1
pay 1
in 1
other 1
ways 1
but 1
money 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
ways 1
basil 1
oh 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
in 1
remorse 1
in 1
suffering 1
in 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
degradation 1
lord 1
henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
mediaeval 1
art 1
is 1
charming 1
but 1
mediaeval 1
emotions 1
are 1
out 1
of 1
date 1
one 1
can 1
use 1
them 1
in 1
fiction 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
only 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
use 1
in 1
fiction 1
are 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
use 1
in 1
fact 1
believe 1
me 1
no 1
civilized 1
man 1
ever 1
regrets 1
a 1
pleasure 1
and 1
no 1
uncivilized 1
man 1
ever 1
knows 1
what 1
a 1
pleasure 1
is 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
pleasure 1
is 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
adore 1
some 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
certainly 1
better 1
than 1
being 1
adored 1
he 1
answered 1
toying 1
with 1
some 1
fruits 1
being 1
adored 1
is 1
a 1
nuisance 1
women 1
treat 1
us 1
just 1
as 1
humanity 1
treats 1
its 1
gods 1
they 1
worship 1
us 1
and 1
are 1
always 1
bothering 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
for 1
them 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
whatever 1
they 1
ask 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
first 1
given 1
to 1
us 1
murmured 1
the 1
lad 1
gravely 1
they 1
create 1
love 1
in 1
our 1
natures 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
demand 1
it 1
back 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
dorian 1
cried 1
hallward 1
nothing 1
is 1
ever 1
quite 1
true 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
this 1
is 1
interrupted 1
dorian 1
you 1
must 1
admit 1
harry 1
that 1
women 1
give 1
to 1
men 1
the 1
very 1
gold 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
possibly 1
he 1
sighed 1
but 1
they 1
invariably 1
want 1
it 1
back 1
in 1
such 1
very 1
small 1
change 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
worry 1

that 1

lord 1

look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
always 1
ready 1
for 1
a 1
new 1
emotion 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
however 1
that 1

at 1
any 1

thing 1

wonderful 1
girl 1

dorian 1

will 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
basil 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
room 1
for 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
brougham 1
you 1
must 1
follow 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
they 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
their 1
coats 1
sipping 1
their 1
coffee 1
standing 1
the 1
painter 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
preoccupied 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
this 1
marriage 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
many 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
might 1
have 1
happened 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
they 1
all 1
passed 1
downstairs 1
he 1
drove 1
off 1
by 1
himself 1
as 1
had 1
been 1
arranged 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
flashing 1
lights 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
brougham 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
a 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
loss 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
dorian 1
gray 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
life 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
them 1
his 1
eyes 1
darkened 1
and 1
the 1
crowded 1
flaring 1
streets 1
became 1
blurred 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
when 1
the 1
cab 1
drew 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
grown 1
years 1
older 1
chapter 1
7 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
or 1
other 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
crowded 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
fat 1
jew 1
manager 1
who 1
met 1
them 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
beaming 1
from 1
ear 1
to 1
ear 1
with 1
an 1
oily 1
tremulous 1
smile 1
he 1
escorted 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
box 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pompous 1
humility 1
waving 1
his 1
fat 1
jewelled 1
hands 1
and 1
talking 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
dorian 1
gray 1
loathed 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
miranda 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
met 1
by 1
caliban 1
lord 1
henry 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
rather 1
liked 1
him 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
declared 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
insisted 1
on 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
assuring 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
proud 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
real 1
genius 1
and 1
gone 1
bankrupt 1
over 1
a 1
poet 1
hallward 1
amused 1
himself 1
with 1
watching 1
the 1
faces 1
in 1
the 1
pit 1
the 1
heat 1
was 1
terribly 1
oppressive 1
and 1
the 1
huge 1
sunlight 1
flamed 1
like 1
a 1
monstrous 1
dahlia 1
with 1
petals 1
of 1
yellow 1
fire 1
the 1
youths 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
had 1
taken 1
off 1
their 1
coats 1
and 1
waistcoats 1
and 1
hung 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
they 1
talked 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
across 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
shared 1
their 1
oranges 1
with 1
the 1
tawdry 1
girls 1
who 1
sat 1
beside 1
them 1
some 1
women 1
were 1
laughing 1
in 1
the 1
pit 1
their 1
voices 1
were 1
horribly 1
shrill 1
and 1
discordant 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
popping 1
of 1
corks 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
bar 1
what 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
find 1
ones 1
divinity 1
in 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
yes 1
answered 1
dorian 1
gray 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
i 1
found 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
divine 1
beyond 1
all 1
living 1
things 1
when 1
she 1
acts 1
you 1
will 1
forget 1
everything 1
these 1
common 1
rough 1
people 1
with 1
their 1
coarse 1
faces 1
and 1
brutal 1
gestures 1
become 1
quite 1
different 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
they 1
sit 1
silently 1
and 1
watch 1
her 1
they 1
weep 1
and 1
laugh 1
as 1
she 1
wills 1
them 1
to 1
do 1
she 1
makes 1
them 1
as 1
responsive 1
as 1
a 1
violin 1
she 1
spiritualizes 1
them 1
and 1
one 1
feels 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
as 1
ones 1
self 1
the 1
same 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
as 1
ones 1
self 1
oh 1
i 1
hope 1
not 1
exclaimed 1
lord 1
henry 1
who 1
was 1
scanning 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
gallery 1
through 1
his 1
operaglass 1
dont 1
pay 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
him 1
dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
i 1
understand 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
in 1
this 1
girl 1
any 1
one 1
you 1
love 1
must 1
be 1
marvellous 1
and 1
any 1
girl 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
effect 1
you 1
describe 1
must 1
be 1
fine 1
and 1
noble 1
to 1
spiritualize 1
ones 1
agethat 1
is 1
something 1
worth 1
doing 1
if 1
this 1
girl 1
can 1
give 1
a 1
soul 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
lived 1
without 1
one 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
create 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
in 1
people 1
whose 1
lives 1
have 1
been 1
sordid 1
and 1
ugly 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
strip 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
selfishness 1
and 1
lend 1
them 1
tears 1
for 1
sorrows 1
that 1
are 1
not 1
their 1
own 1
she 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
all 1
your 1
adoration 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
adoration 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
this 1
marriage 1
is 1
quite 1
right 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
i 1
admit 1
it 1
now 1
the 1
gods 1
made 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
for 1
you 1
without 1
her 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
incomplete 1
thanks 1
basil 1
answered 1
dorian 1
gray 1
pressing 1
his 1
hand 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
me 1
harry 1
is 1
so 1
cynical 1
he 1
terrifies 1
me 1
but 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
orchestra 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
dreadful 1
but 1
it 1
only 1
lasts 1
for 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
then 1
the 1
curtain 1
rises 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
in 1
me 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
amidst 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
turmoil 1
of 1
applause 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
stepped 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
yes 1
she 1
was 1
certainly 1
lovely 1
to 1
look 1
atone 1
of 1
the 1
loveliest 1
creatures 1
lord 1
henry 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
fawn 1
in 1
her 1
shy 1
grace 1
and 1
startled 1
eyes 1
a 1
faint 1
blush 1
like 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
rose 1
in 1
a 1
mirror 1
of 1
silver 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
cheeks 1
as 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
crowded 1
enthusiastic 1
house 1
she 1
stepped 1
back 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
seemed 1
to 1
tremble 1
basil 1
hallward 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
applaud 1
motionless 1
and 1
as 1
one 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
sat 1
dorian 1
gray 1
gazing 1
at 1
her 1
lord 1
henry 1
peered 1
through 1
his 1
glasses 1
murmuring 1
charming 1
charming 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
capulets 1
house 1
and 1
romeo 1
in 1
his 1
pilgrims 1
dress 1
had 1
entered 1
with 1
mercutio 1
and 1
his 1
other 1
friends 1
the 1
band 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
struck 1
up 1
a 1
few 1
bars 1
of 1
music 1
and 1
the 1
dance 1
began 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
of 1
ungainly 1
shabbily 1
dressed 1
actors 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
moved 1
like 1
a 1
creature 1
from 1
a 1
finer 1
world 1
her 1
body 1
swayed 1
while 1
she 1
danced 1
as 1
a 1
plant 1
sways 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
her 1
throat 1
were 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
a 1
white 1
lily 1
her 1
hands 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
of 1
cool 1
ivory 1
yet 1
she 1
was 1
curiously 1
listless 1
she 1
showed 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
joy 1
when 1
her 1
eyes 1
rested 1
on 1
romeo 1
the 1
few 1
words 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
good 1
pilgrim 1
you 1
do 1
wrong 1
your 1
hand 1
too 1
much 1
which 1
mannerly 1
devotion 1
shows 1
in 1
this 1
for 1
saints 1
have 1
hands 1
that 1
pilgrims 1
hands 1
do 1
touch 1
and 1
palm 1
to 1
palm 1
is 1
holy 1
palmers 1
kiss 1
with 1
the 1
brief 1
dialogue 1
that 1
follows 1
were 1
spoken 1
in 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
artificial 1
manner 1
the 1
voice 1
was 1
exquisite 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
tone 1
it 1
was 1
absolutely 1
false 1
it 1
was 1
wrong 1
in 1
colour 1
it 1
took 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
life 1
from 1
the 1
verse 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
passion 1
unreal 1
dorian 1
gray 1
grew 1
pale 1
as 1
he 1
watched 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
puzzled 1
and 1
anxious 1
neither 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
dared 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
incompetent 1
they 1
were 1
horribly 1
disappointed 1
yet 1
they 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
test 1
of 1
any 1
juliet 1
is 1
the 1
balcony 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
act 1
they 1
waited 1
for 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
failed 1
there 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
her 1
she 1
looked 1
charming 1
as 1
she 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
denied 1
but 1
the 1
staginess 1
of 1
her 1
acting 1
was 1
unbearable 1
and 1
grew 1
worse 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
gestures 1
became 1
absurdly 1
artificial 1
she 1
overemphasized 1
everything 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
beautiful 1
passage 1
thou 1
knowest 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
night 1
is 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
else 1
would 1
a 1
maiden 1
blush 1
bepaint 1
my 1
cheek 1
for 1
that 1
which 1
thou 1
hast 1
heard 1
me 1
speak 1
tonight 1
was 1
declaimed 1
with 1
the 1
painful 1
precision 1
of 1
a 1
schoolgirl 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
recite 1
by 1
some 1
secondrate 1
professor 1
of 1
elocution 1
when 1
she 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
balcony 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
those 1
wonderful 1
lines 1
although 1
i 1
joy 1
in 1
thee 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
joy 1
of 1
this 1
contract 1
tonight 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
rash 1
too 1
unadvised 1
too 1
sudden 1
too 1
like 1
the 1
lightning 1
which 1
doth 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
ere 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
it 1
lightens 1
sweet 1
goodnight 1
this 1
bud 1
of 1
love 1
by 1
summers 1
ripening 1
breath 1
may 1
prove 1
a 1
beauteous 1
flower 1
when 1
next 1
we 1
meet 1
she 1
spoke 1
the 1
words 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
conveyed 1
no 1
meaning 1
to 1
her 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
nervousness 1
indeed 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
nervous 1
she 1
was 1
absolutely 1
selfcontained 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
bad 1
art 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
complete 1
failure 1
even 1
the 1
common 1
uneducated 1
audience 1
of 1
the 1
pit 1
and 1
gallery 1
lost 1
their 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
play 1
they 1
got 1
restless 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
loudly 1
and 1
to 1
whistle 1
the 1
jew 1
manager 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
dresscircle 1
stamped 1
and 1
swore 1
with 1
rage 1
the 1
only 1
person 1
unmoved 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
herself 1
when 1
the 1
second 1
act 1
was 1
over 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
storm 1
of 1
hisses 1
and 1
lord 1
henry 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
coat 1
she 1
is 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
she 1
cant 1
act 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
play 1
through 1
answered 1
the 1
lad 1
in 1
a 1
hard 1
bitter 1
voice 1
i 1
am 1
awfully 1
sorry 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
waste 1
an 1
evening 1
harry 1
i 1
apologize 1
to 1
you 1
both 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
miss 1
vane 1
was 1
ill 1
interrupted 1
hallward 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
some 1
other 1
night 1
i 1
wish 1
she 1
were 1
ill 1
he 1
rejoined 1
but 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
simply 1
callous 1
and 1
cold 1
she 1
has 1
entirely 1
altered 1
last 1
night 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
this 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
merely 1
a 1
commonplace 1
mediocre 1
actress 1
dont 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
about 1
any 1
one 1
you 1
love 1
dorian 1
love 1
is 1
a 1
more 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
than 1
art 1
they 1
are 1
both 1
simply 1
forms 1
of 1
imitation 1
remarked 1
lord 1
henry 1
but 1
do 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
dorian 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
stay 1
here 1
any 1
longer 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
good 1
for 1
ones 1
morals 1
to 1
see 1
bad 1
acting 1
besides 1
i 1
dont 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
want 1
your 1
wife 1
to 1
act 1
so 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
if 1
she 1
plays 1
juliet 1
like 1
a 1
wooden 1
doll 1
she 1
is 1
very 1
lovely 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
knows 1
as 1
little 1
about 1
life 1
as 1
she 1
does 1
about 1
acting 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
experience 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
really 1
fascinatingpeople 1
who 1
know 1
absolutely 1
everything 1
and 1
people 1
who 1
know 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
good 1
heavens 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
dont 1
look 1
so 1
tragic 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
remaining 1
young 1
is 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
emotion 1
that 1
is 1
unbecoming 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
with 1
basil 1
and 1
myself 1
we 1
will 1
smoke 1
cigarettes 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
what 1
more 1
can 1
you 1
want 1

the 1
lad 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
basil 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
ah 1
cant 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
breaking 1
the 1
hot 1
tears 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
his 1
lips 1
trembled 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
he 1
leaned 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
hiding 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
basil 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
tenderness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
passed 1
out 1
together 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
afterwards 1
the 1
footlights 1
flared 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
curtain 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
act 1
dorian 1
gray 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
he 1
looked 1
pale 1
and 1
proud 1
and 1
indifferent 1
the 1
play 1
dragged 1
on 1
and 1
seemed 1
interminable 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
audience 1
went 1
out 1
tramping 1
in 1
heavy 1
boots 1
and 1
laughing 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
a 1
_fiasco_ 1
the 1
last 1
act 1
was 1
played 1
to 1
almost 1
empty 1
benches 1
the 1
curtain 1
went 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
titter 1
and 1
some 1
groans 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
dorian 1
gray 1
rushed 1
behind 1
the 1
scenes 1
into 1
the 1
greenroom 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
standing 1
there 1
alone 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
triumph 1
on 1
her 1
face 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
lit 1
with 1
an 1
exquisite 1
fire 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
radiance 1
about 1
her 1
her 1
parted 1
lips 1
were 1
smiling 1
over 1
some 1
secret 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
infinite 1
joy 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
how 1
badly 1
i 1
acted 1
tonight 1
dorian 1
she 1
cried 1
horribly 1
he 1
answered 1
gazing 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
horribly 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
are 1
you 1
ill 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
i 1
suffered 1
the 1
girl 1
smiled 1
dorian 1
she 1
answered 1
lingering 1
over 1
his 1
name 1
with 1
longdrawn 1
music 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
sweeter 1
than 1
honey 1
to 1
the 1
red 1
petals 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
dorian 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
understood 1
but 1
you 1
understand 1
now 1
dont 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
he 1
asked 1
angrily 1
why 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
bad 1
tonight 1
why 1
i 1
shall 1
always 1
be 1
bad 1
why 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
act 1
well 1
again 1
he 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
i 1
suppose 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
you 1
shouldnt 1
act 1
you 1
make 1
yourself 1
ridiculous 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
bored 1
i 1
was 1
bored 1
she 1
seemed 1
not 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
was 1
transfigured 1
with 1
joy 1
an 1
ecstasy 1
of 1
happiness 1
dominated 1
her 1
dorian 1
dorian 1
she 1
cried 1
before 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
acting 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
reality 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
theatre 1
that 1
i 1
lived 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
true 1
i 1
was 1
rosalind 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
portia 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
beatrice 1
was 1
my 1
joy 1
and 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
cordelia 1
were 1
mine 1
also 1
i 1
believed 1
in 1
everything 1
the 1
common 1
people 1
who 1
acted 1
with 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
godlike 1
the 1
painted 1
scenes 1
were 1
my 1
world 1
i 1
knew 1
nothing 1
but 1
shadows 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
them 1
real 1
you 1
cameoh 1
my 1
beautiful 1
loveand 1
you 1
freed 1
my 1
soul 1
from 1
prison 1
you 1
taught 1
me 1
what 1
reality 1
really 1
is 1
tonight 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
saw 1
through 1
the 1
hollowness 1
the 1
sham 1
the 1
silliness 1
of 1
the 1
empty 1
pageant 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
played 1
tonight 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
became 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
romeo 1
was 1
hideous 1
and 1
old 1
and 1
painted 1
that 1
the 1
moonlight 1
in 1
the 1
orchard 1
was 1
false 1
that 1
the 1
scenery 1
was 1
vulgar 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
were 1
unreal 1
were 1
not 1
my 1
words 1
were 1
not 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
had 1
brought 1
me 1
something 1
higher 1
something 1
of 1
which 1
all 1
art 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
reflection 1
you 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
understand 1
what 1
love 1
really 1
is 1
my 1
love 1
my 1
love 1
prince 1
charming 1
prince 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
have 1
grown 1
sick 1
of 1
shadows 1
you 1
are 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
all 1
art 1
can 1
ever 1
be 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
puppets 1
of 1
a 1
play 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
on 1
tonight 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
everything 1
had 1
gone 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
wonderful 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
suddenly 1
it 1
dawned 1
on 1
my 1
soul 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
meant 1
the 1
knowledge 1
was 1
exquisite 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
heard 1
them 1
hissing 1
and 1
i 1
smiled 1
what 1
could 1
they 1
know 1
of 1
love 1
such 1
as 1
ours 1
take 1
me 1
away 1
doriantake 1
me 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
be 1
quite 1
alone 1
i 1
hate 1
the 1
stage 1
i 1
might 1
mimic 1
a 1
passion 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
mimic 1
one 1
that 1
burns 1
me 1
like 1
fire 1
oh 1
dorian 1
dorian 1
you 1
understand 1
now 1
what 1
it 1
signifies 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
profanation 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
play 1
at 1
being 1
in 1
love 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
turned 1
away 1
his 1
face 1
you 1
have 1
killed 1
my 1
love 1
he 1
muttered 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
wonder 1
and 1
laughed 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
she 1
came 1
across 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
with 1
her 1
little 1
fingers 1
stroked 1
his 1
hair 1
she 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
pressed 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
he 1
drew 1
them 1
away 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
leaped 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
yes 1
he 1
cried 1
you 1
have 1
killed 1
my 1
love 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
stir 1
my 1
imagination 1
now 1
you 1
dont 1
even 1
stir 1
my 1
curiosity 1
you 1
simply 1
produce 1
no 1
effect 1
i 1
loved 1
you 1
because 1
you 1
were 1
marvellous 1
because 1
you 1
had 1
genius 1
and 1
intellect 1
because 1
you 1
realized 1
the 1
dreams 1
of 1
great 1
poets 1
and 1
gave 1
shape 1
and 1
substance 1
to 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
art 1
you 1
have 1
thrown 1
it 1
all 1
away 1
you 1
are 1
shallow 1
and 1
stupid 1
my 1
god 1
how 1
mad 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
what 1
a 1
fool 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
you 1
are 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
think 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
mention 1
your 1
name 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
me 1
once 1
why 1
once 1
oh 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
laid 1
eyes 1
upon 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
spoiled 1
the 1
romance 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
how 1
little 1
you 1
can 1
know 1
of 1
love 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
mars 1
your 1
art 1
without 1
your 1
art 1
you 1
are 1
nothing 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
famous 1
splendid 1
magnificent 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
have 1
worshipped 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
borne 1
my 1
name 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
now 1
a 1
thirdrate 1
actress 1
with 1
a 1
pretty 1
face 1
the 1
girl 1
grew 1
white 1
and 1
trembled 1
she 1
clenched 1
her 1
hands 1
together 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
seemed 1
to 1
catch 1
in 1
her 1
throat 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
dorian 1
she 1
murmured 1
you 1
are 1
acting 1
acting 1
i 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
he 1
answered 1
bitterly 1
she 1
rose 1
from 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
piteous 1
expression 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
came 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
looked 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
thrust 1
her 1
back 1
dont 1
touch 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
a 1
low 1
moan 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
flung 1
herself 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
like 1
a 1
trampled 1
flower 1
dorian 1
dorian 1
dont 1
leave 1
me 1
she 1
whispered 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
i 1
didnt 1
act 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
tryindeed 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
it 1
came 1
so 1
suddenly 1
across 1
me 1
my 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
known 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
kissed 1
meif 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1

love 1

go 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
couldnt 1
bear 1
it 1
oh 1
dont 1
go 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
my 1
brother 1
no 1
never 1
mind 1
he 1
didnt 1
mean 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
jest 1
but 1
you 1
oh 1
cant 1
you 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
tonight 1
i 1
will 1
work 1
so 1
hard 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
improve 1
dont 1
be 1
cruel 1
to 1
me 1
because 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
better 1
than 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
once 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
pleased 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
dorian 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
shown 1
myself 1
more 1
of 1
an 1
artist 1
it 1
was 1
foolish 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
couldnt 1
help 1
it 1
oh 1
dont 1
leave 1
me 1
dont 1
leave 1
me 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
passionate 1
sobbing 1
choked 1
her 1
she 1
crouched 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
like 1
a 1
wounded 1
thing 1
and 1
dorian 1
gray 1
with 1
his 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
his 1
chiselled 1
lips 1
curled 1
in 1
exquisite 1
disdain 1
there 1
is 1
always 1
something 1
ridiculous 1
about 1
the 1
emotions 1
of 1
people 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
absurdly 1
melodramatic 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
sobs 1
annoyed 1
him 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
his 1
calm 1
clear 1
voice 1
i 1
dont 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
unkind 1
but 1
i 1
cant 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
you 1
have 1
disappointed 1
me 1
she 1
wept 1
silently 1
and 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
crept 1
nearer 1
her 1
little 1
hands 1
stretched 1
blindly 1
out 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
seeking 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
theatre 1
where 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
he 1
hardly 1
knew 1
he 1
remembered 1
wandering 1
through 1
dimly 1
lit 1
streets 1
past 1
gaunt 1
blackshadowed 1
archways 1
and 1
evillooking 1
houses 1
women 1
with 1
hoarse 1
voices 1
and 1
harsh 1
laughter 1
had 1
called 1
after 1
him 1
drunkards 1
had 1
reeled 1
by 1
cursing 1
and 1
chattering 1
to 1
themselves 1
like 1
monstrous 1
apes 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
grotesque 1
children 1
huddled 1
upon 1
doorsteps 1
and 1
heard 1
shrieks 1
and 1
oaths 1
from 1
gloomy 1
courts 1
as 1
the 1
dawn 1
was 1
just 1
breaking 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
close 1
to 1
covent 1
garden 1
the 1
darkness 1
lifted 1
and 1
flushed 1
with 1
faint 1
fires 1
the 1
sky 1
hollowed 1
itself 1
into 1
a 1
perfect 1
pearl 1
huge 1
carts 1
filled 1
with 1
nodding 1
lilies 1
rumbled 1
slowly 1
down 1
the 1
polished 1
empty 1
street 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
heavy 1
with 1
the 1
perfume 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
and 1
their 1
beauty 1
seemed 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
an 1
anodyne 1
for 1
his 1
pain 1
he 1
followed 1
into 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
men 1
unloading 1
their 1
waggons 1
a 1
whitesmocked 1
carter 1
offered 1
him 1
some 1
cherries 1
he 1
thanked 1
him 1
wondered 1
why 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
accept 1
any 1
money 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
them 1
listlessly 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
plucked 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
coldness 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
them 1
a 1
long 1
line 1
of 1
boys 1
carrying 1
crates 1
of 1
striped 1
tulips 1
and 1
of 1
yellow 1
and 1
red 1
roses 1
defiled 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
threading 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
huge 1
jadegreen 1
piles 1
of 1
vegetables 1
under 1
the 1
portico 1
with 1
its 1
grey 1
sunbleached 1
pillars 1
loitered 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
draggled 1
bareheaded 1
girls 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
auction 1
to 1
be 1
over 1
others 1
crowded 1
round 1
the 1
swinging 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
coffeehouse 1
in 1
the 1
piazza 1
the 1
heavy 1
carthorses 1
slipped 1
and 1
stamped 1
upon 1
the 1
rough 1
stones 1
shaking 1
their 1
bells 1
and 1
trappings 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
drivers 1
were 1
lying 1
asleep 1
on 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
sacks 1
irisnecked 1
and 1
pinkfooted 1
the 1
pigeons 1
ran 1
about 1
picking 1
up 1
seeds 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
hailed 1
a 1
hansom 1
and 1
drove 1
home 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
loitered 1
upon 1
the 1
doorstep 1
looking 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
silent 1
square 1
with 1
its 1
blank 1
closeshuttered 1
windows 1
and 1
its 1
staring 1
blinds 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
pure 1
opal 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
glistened 1
like 1
silver 1
against 1
it 1
from 1
some 1
chimney 1
opposite 1
a 1
thin 1
wreath 1
of 1
smoke 1
was 1
rising 1
it 1
curled 1
a 1
violet 1
riband 1
through 1
the 1
nacrecoloured 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
huge 1
gilt 1
venetian 1
lantern 1
spoil 1
of 1
some 1
doges 1
barge 1
that 1
hung 1
from 1
the 1
ceiling 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
oakpanelled 1
hall 1
of 1
entrance 1
lights 1
were 1
still 1
burning 1
from 1
three 1
flickering 1
jets 1
thin 1
blue 1
petals 1
of 1
flame 1
they 1
seemed 1
rimmed 1
with 1
white 1
fire 1
he 1
turned 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
having 1
thrown 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
cape 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
library 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
bedroom 1
a 1
large 1
octagonal 1
chamber 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
newborn 1
feeling 1
for 1
luxury 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
had 1
decorated 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
hung 1
with 1
some 1
curious 1
renaissance 1
tapestries 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
stored 1
in 1
a 1
disused 1
attic 1
at 1
selby 1
royal 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
turning 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
portrait 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
started 1
back 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
surprise 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
looking 1
somewhat 1
puzzled 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
buttonhole 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
hesitate 1
finally 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
arrested 1
light 1
that 1
struggled 1
through 1
the 1
creamcoloured 1
silk 1
blinds 1
the 1
face 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
changed 1
the 1
expression 1
looked 1
different 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
strange 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
walking 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
drew 1
up 1
the 1
blind 1
the 1
bright 1
dawn 1
flooded 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
swept 1
the 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
into 1
dusky 1
corners 1
where 1
they 1
lay 1
shuddering 1
but 1
the 1
strange 1
expression 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
noticed 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
seemed 1
to 1
linger 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
intensified 1
even 1
the 1
quivering 1
ardent 1
sunlight 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
cruelty 1
round 1
the 1
mouth 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
into 1
a 1
mirror 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
some 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
he 1
winced 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
an 1
oval 1
glass 1
framed 1
in 1
ivory 1
cupids 1
one 1
of 1
lord 1
henrys 1
many 1
presents 1
to 1
him 1
glanced 1
hurriedly 1
into 1
its 1
polished 1
depths 1
no 1
line 1
like 1
that 1
warped 1
his 1
red 1
lips 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
mean 1
he 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
again 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
change 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
actual 1
painting 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
expression 1
had 1
altered 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
mere 1
fancy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
horribly 1
apparent 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
suddenly 1
there 1
flashed 1
across 1
his 1
mind 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
in 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
studio 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
been 1
finished 1
yes 1
he 1
remembered 1
it 1
perfectly 1
he 1
had 1
uttered 1
a 1
mad 1
wish 1
that 1
he 1
himself 1
might 1
remain 1
young 1
and 1
the 1
portrait 1
grow 1
old 1
that 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
might 1
be 1
untarnished 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
passions 1
and 1
his 1
sins 1
that 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
might 1
be 1
seared 1
with 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
suffering 1
and 1
thought 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
keep 1
all 1
the 1
delicate 1
bloom 1
and 1
loveliness 1
of 1
his 1
then 1
just 1
conscious 1
boyhood 1
surely 1
his 1
wish 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
fulfilled 1
such 1
things 1
were 1
impossible 1
it 1
seemed 1
monstrous 1
even 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
picture 1
before 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
cruelty 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
cruel 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
girls 1
fault 1
not 1
his 1
he 1
had 1
dreamed 1
of 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
her 1
great 1
then 1
she 1
had 1
disappointed 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
shallow 1
and 1
unworthy 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
infinite 1
regret 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
lying 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
sobbing 1
like 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
he 1
remembered 1
with 1
what 1
callousness 1
he 1
had 1
watched 1
her 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
made 1
like 1
that 1
why 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
soul 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
also 1
during 1
the 1
three 1
terrible 1
hours 1
that 1
the 1
play 1
had 1
lasted 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
centuries 1
of 1
pain 1
aeon 1
upon 1
aeon 1
of 1
torture 1
his 1
life 1
was 1
well 1
worth 1
hers 1
she 1
had 1
marred 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
wounded 1
her 1
for 1
an 1
age 1
besides 1
women 1
were 1
better 1
suited 1
to 1
bear 1
sorrow 1
than 1
men 1
they 1
lived 1
on 1
their 1
emotions 1
they 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
their 1
emotions 1
when 1
they 1
took 1
lovers 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
scenes 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
and 1
lord 1
henry 1
knew 1
what 1
women 1
were 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
trouble 1
about 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
she 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
but 1
the 1
picture 1
what 1
was 1
he 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
that 1
it 1
held 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
story 1
it 1
had 1
taught 1
him 1
to 1
love 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
would 1
it 1
teach 1
him 1
to 1
loathe 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
would 1
he 1
ever 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
again 1
no 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
an 1
illusion 1
wrought 1
on 1
the 1
troubled 1
senses 1
the 1
horrible 1
night 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
had 1
left 1
phantoms 1
behind 1
it 1
suddenly 1
there 1
had 1
fallen 1
upon 1
his 1
brain 1
that 1
tiny 1
scarlet 1
speck 1
that 1
makes 1
men 1
mad 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
not 1
changed 1
it 1
was 1
folly 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
watching 1
him 1
with 1
its 1
beautiful 1
marred 1
face 1
and 1
its 1
cruel 1
smile 1
its 1
bright 1
hair 1
gleamed 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
sunlight 1
its 1
blue 1
eyes 1
met 1
his 1
own 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
infinite 1
pity 1
not 1
for 1
himself 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
of 1
himself 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
altered 1
already 1
and 1
would 1
alter 1
more 1
its 1
gold 1
would 1
wither 1
into 1
grey 1
its 1
red 1
and 1
white 1
roses 1
would 1
die 1
for 1
every 1
sin 1
that 1
he 1
committed 1
a 1
stain 1
would 1
fleck 1
and 1
wreck 1
its 1
fairness 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
sin 1
the 1
picture 1
changed 1
or 1
unchanged 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
visible 1
emblem 1
of 1
conscience 1
he 1
would 1
resist 1
temptation 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
see 1
lord 1
henry 1
any 1
morewould 1
not 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
listen 1
to 1
those 1
subtle 1
poisonous 1
theories 1
that 1
in 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
garden 1
had 1
first 1
stirred 1
within 1
him 1
the 1
passion 1
for 1
impossible 1
things 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
make 1
her 1
amends 1
marry 1
her 1
try 1
to 1
love 1
her 1
again 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
duty 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
poor 1
child 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
selfish 1
and 1
cruel 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
fascination 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
exercised 1
over 1
him 1
would 1
return 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
happy 1
together 1
his 1
life 1
with 1
her 1
would 1
be 1
beautiful 1
and 1
pure 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
large 1
screen 1
right 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
shuddering 1
as 1
he 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
how 1
horrible 1
he 1
murmured 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
he 1
walked 1
across 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
stepped 1
out 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
grass 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
the 1
fresh 1
morning 1
air 1
seemed 1
to 1
drive 1
away 1
all 1
his 1
sombre 1
passions 1
he 1
thought 1
only 1
of 1
sibyl 1
a 1
faint 1
echo 1
of 1
his 1
love 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
repeated 1
her 1
name 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
the 1
birds 1
that 1
were 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
dewdrenched 1
garden 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
telling 1
the 1
flowers 1
about 1
her 1
chapter 1
8 1
it 1
was 1
long 1
past 1
noon 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
his 1
valet 1
had 1
crept 1
several 1
times 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
stirring 1
and 1
had 1
wondered 1
what 1
made 1
his 1
young 1
master 1
sleep 1
so 1
late 1
finally 1
his 1
bell 1
sounded 1
and 1
victor 1
came 1
in 1
softly 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
and 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
letters 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
tray 1
of 1
old 1
sevres 1
china 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
olivesatin 1
curtains 1
with 1
their 1
shimmering 1
blue 1
lining 1
that 1
hung 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
tall 1
windows 1
monsieur 1
has 1
well 1
slept 1
this 1
morning 1
he 1
said 1
smiling 1
what 1
oclock 1
is 1
it 1
victor 1
asked 1
dorian 1
gray 1
drowsily 1
one 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
monsieur 1
how 1
late 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
and 1
having 1
sipped 1
some 1
tea 1
turned 1
over 1
his 1
letters 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
from 1
lord 1
henry 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
by 1
hand 1
that 1
morning 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
it 1
aside 1
the 1
others 1
he 1
opened 1
listlessly 1
they 1
contained 1
the 1
usual 1
collection 1
of 1
cards 1
invitations 1
to 1
dinner 1
tickets 1
for 1
private 1
views 1
programmes 1
of 1
charity 1
concerts 1
and 1
the 1
like 1
that 1
are 1
showered 1
on 1
fashionable 1
young 1
men 1
every 1
morning 1
during 1
the 1
season 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rather 1
heavy 1
bill 1
for 1
a 1
chased 1
silver 1
louisquinze 1
toiletset 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
send 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
guardians 1
who 1
were 1
extremely 1
oldfashioned 1
people 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
realize 1
that 1
we 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
when 1
unnecessary 1
things 1
are 1
our 1
only 1
necessities 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
very 1
courteously 1
worded 1
communications 1
from 1
jermyn 1
street 1
moneylenders 1
offering 1
to 1
advance 1
any 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
at 1
a 1
moments 1
notice 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
reasonable 1
rates 1
of 1
interest 1
after 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
throwing 1
on 1
an 1
elaborate 1
dressinggown 1
of 1
silkembroidered 1
cashmere 1
wool 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
onyxpaved 1
bathroom 1
the 1
cool 1
water 1
refreshed 1
him 1
after 1
his 1
long 1
sleep 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
forgotten 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
a 1
dim 1
sense 1
of 1
having 1
taken 1
part 1
in 1
some 1
strange 1
tragedy 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
unreality 1
of 1
a 1
dream 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
french 1
breakfast 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
out 1
for 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
round 1
table 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
exquisite 1
day 1
the 1
warm 1
air 1
seemed 1
laden 1
with 1
spices 1
a 1
bee 1
flew 1
in 1
and 1
buzzed 1
round 1
the 1
bluedragon 1
bowl 1
that 1
filled 1
with 1
sulphuryellow 1
roses 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
he 1
felt 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
suddenly 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
and 1
he 1
started 1
too 1
cold 1
for 1
monsieur 1
asked 1
his 1
valet 1
putting 1
an 1
omelette 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
i 1
shut 1
the 1
window 1
dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
cold 1
he 1
murmured 1
was 1
it 1
all 1
true 1
had 1
the 1
portrait 1
really 1
changed 1
or 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
simply 1
his 1
own 1
imagination 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
see 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
evil 1
where 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
joy 1
surely 1
a 1
painted 1
canvas 1
could 1
not 1
alter 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
absurd 1
it 1
would 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
tale 1
to 1
tell 1
basil 1
some 1
day 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
smile 1
and 1
yet 1
how 1
vivid 1
was 1
his 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
first 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
twilight 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
bright 1
dawn 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
round 1
the 1
warped 1
lips 1
he 1
almost 1
dreaded 1
his 1
valet 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
portrait 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
certainty 1
when 1
the 1
coffee 1
and 1
cigarettes 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
turned 1
to 1
go 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
as 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
closing 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
called 1
him 1
back 1
the 1
man 1
stood 1
waiting 1
for 1
his 1
orders 1
dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
victor 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
the 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
retired 1
then 1
he 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
luxuriously 1
cushioned 1
couch 1
that 1
stood 1
facing 1
the 1
screen 1
the 1
screen 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
one 1
of 1
gilt 1
spanish 1
leather 1
stamped 1
and 1
wrought 1
with 1
a 1
rather 1
florid 1
louisquatorze 1
pattern 1
he 1
scanned 1
it 1
curiously 1
wondering 1
if 1
ever 1
before 1
it 1
had 1
concealed 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
a 1
mans 1
life 1
should 1
he 1
move 1
it 1
aside 1
after 1
all 1
why 1
not 1
let 1
it 1
stay 1
there 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
knowing 1
if 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
true 1
it 1
was 1
terrible 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
true 1
why 1
trouble 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
what 1
if 1
by 1
some 1
fate 1
or 1
deadlier 1
chance 1
eyes 1
other 1
than 1
his 1
spied 1
behind 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
horrible 1
change 1
what 1
should 1
he 1
do 1
if 1
basil 1
hallward 1
came 1
and 1
asked 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
picture 1
basil 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
no 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
examined 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
anything 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
dreadful 1
state 1
of 1
doubt 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
locked 1
both 1
doors 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
alone 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
his 1
shame 1
then 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
aside 1
and 1
saw 1
himself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
true 1
the 1
portrait 1
had 1
altered 1
as 1
he 1
often 1
remembered 1
afterwards 1
and 1
always 1
with 1
no 1
small 1
wonder 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
first 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
portrait 1
with 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
almost 1
scientific 1
interest 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
change 1
should 1
have 1
taken 1
place 1
was 1
incredible 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fact 1
was 1
there 1
some 1
subtle 1
affinity 1
between 1
the 1
chemical 1
atoms 1
that 1
shaped 1
themselves 1
into 1
form 1
and 1
colour 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
the 1
soul 1
that 1
was 1
within 1
him 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
what 1
that 1
soul 1
thought 1
they 1
realizedthat 1
what 1
it 1
dreamed 1
they 1
made 1
true 1
or 1
was 1
there 1
some 1
other 1
more 1
terrible 1
reason 1
he 1
shuddered 1
and 1
felt 1
afraid 1
and 1
going 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
couch 1
lay 1
there 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
in 1
sickened 1
horror 1
one 1
thing 1
however 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
conscious 1
how 1
unjust 1
how 1
cruel 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
make 1
reparation 1
for 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
still 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
his 1
unreal 1
and 1
selfish 1
love 1
would 1
yield 1
to 1
some 1
higher 1
influence 1
would 1
be 1
transformed 1
into 1
some 1
nobler 1
passion 1
and 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
basil 1
hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
guide 1
to 1
him 1
through 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
holiness 1
is 1
to 1
some 1
and 1
conscience 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
god 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
there 1
were 1
opiates 1
for 1
remorse 1
drugs 1
that 1
could 1
lull 1
the 1
moral 1
sense 1
to 1
sleep 1
but 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
visible 1
symbol 1
of 1
the 1
degradation 1
of 1
sin 1
here 1
was 1
an 1
everpresent 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
ruin 1
men 1
brought 1
upon 1
their 1
souls 1
three 1
oclock 1
struck 1
and 1
four 1
and 1
the 1
halfhour 1
rang 1
its 1
double 1
chime 1
but 1
dorian 1
gray 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
gather 1
up 1
the 1
scarlet 1
threads 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
weave 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
pattern 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
sanguine 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
passion 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
wandering 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
or 1
what 1
to 1
think 1
finally 1
he 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wrote 1
a 1
passionate 1
letter 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
he 1
had 1
loved 1
imploring 1
her 1
forgiveness 1
and 1
accusing 1
himself 1
of 1
madness 1
he 1
covered 1
page 1
after 1
page 1
with 1
wild 1
words 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
wilder 1
words 1
of 1
pain 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
luxury 1
in 1
selfreproach 1
when 1
we 1
blame 1
ourselves 1
we 1
feel 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
blame 1
us 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
confession 1
not 1
the 1
priest 1
that 1
gives 1
us 1
absolution 1
when 1
dorian 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
letter 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forgiven 1
suddenly 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
knock 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
lord 1
henrys 1
voice 1
outside 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
you 1
let 1
me 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
your 1
shutting 1
yourself 1
up 1
like 1
this 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
remained 1
quite 1
still 1
the 1
knocking 1
still 1
continued 1
and 1
grew 1
louder 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
better 1
to 1
let 1
lord 1
henry 1
in 1
and 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
new 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
lead 1
to 1
quarrel 1
with 1
him 1
if 1
it 1
became 1
necessary 1
to 1
quarrel 1
to 1
part 1
if 1
parting 1
was 1
inevitable 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
hastily 1
across 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
too 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
about 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
asked 1
the 1
lad 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
sinking 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
slowly 1
pulling 1
off 1
his 1
yellow 1
gloves 1
it 1
is 1
dreadful 1
from 1
one 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
your 1
fault 1
tell 1
me 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
behind 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
after 1
the 1
play 1
was 1
over 1
yes 1
i 1
felt 1
sure 1
you 1
had 1
did 1
you 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
with 1
her 1
i 1
was 1
brutal 1
harryperfectly 1
brutal 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sorry 1
for 1
anything 1
that 1
has 1
happened 1
it 1
has 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
know 1
myself 1
better 1
ah 1
dorian 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
you 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
i 1
would 1
find 1
you 1
plunged 1
in 1
remorse 1
and 1
tearing 1
that 1
nice 1
curly 1
hair 1
of 1
yours 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
through 1
all 1
that 1
said 1
dorian 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
smiling 1
i 1
am 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
conscience 1
is 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
divinest 1
thing 1
in 1
us 1
dont 1
sneer 1
at 1
it 1
harry 1
any 1
moreat 1
least 1
not 1
before 1
me 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
being 1
hideous 1
a 1
very 1
charming 1
artistic 1
basis 1
for 1
ethics 1
dorian 1
i 1
congratulate 1
you 1
on 1
it 1
but 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
begin 1
by 1
marrying 1
sibyl 1

cried 1
lord 1
henry 1
standing 1
up 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
perplexed 1
amazement 1
but 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
yes 1

something 1
in 1

that 1
i 1
wouldnt 1

lord 1
henry 1
walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
by 1
dorian 1
gray 1
took 1
both 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
held 1
them 1
tightly 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
my 1
letterdont 1
be 1
frightenedwas 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
is 1
dead 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
lads 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
tearing 1
his 1
hands 1
away 1
from 1
lord 1
henrys 1
grasp 1
dead 1
sibyl 1
dead 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
horrible 1
lie 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
dorian 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
gravely 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
i 1
wrote 1
down 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
any 1
one 1
till 1
i 1
came 1
there 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
inquest 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
it 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
fashionable 1
in 1
paris 1
but 1
in 1
london 1
people 1
are 1
so 1
prejudiced 1
here 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
make 1
ones 1
_debut_ 1
with 1
a 1
scandal 1
one 1
should 1
reserve 1
that 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
interest 1
to 1
ones 1
old 1
age 1
i 1
suppose 1
they 1
dont 1
know 1
your 1
name 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
if 1
they 1
dont 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
did 1
any 1
one 1
see 1
you 1
going 1
round 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
that 1
is 1
an 1
important 1
point 1
dorian 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
was 1
dazed 1
with 1
horror 1
finally 1
he 1
stammered 1
in 1
a 1
stifled 1
voice 1
harry 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
an 1
inquest 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
did 1
sibyl 1
oh 1
harry 1
i 1
cant 1
bear 1
it 1
but 1
be 1
quick 1
tell 1
me 1
everything 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
accident 1
dorian 1
though 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
put 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
public 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
leaving 1
the 1
theatre 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
about 1
halfpast 1
twelve 1
or 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
forgotten 1
something 1
upstairs 1
they 1
waited 1
some 1
time 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
down 1
again 1
they 1
ultimately 1
found 1
her 1
lying 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
her 1
dressingroom 1
she 1
had 1
swallowed 1
something 1
by 1
mistake 1
some 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
they 1
use 1
at 1
theatres 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
either 1
prussic 1
acid 1
or 1
white 1
lead 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
fancy 1
it 1
was 1
prussic 1
acid 1
as 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
died 1
instantaneously 1
harry 1
harry 1
it 1
is 1
terrible 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
yes 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
tragic 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
get 1
yourself 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
see 1
by 1
_the 1
standard_ 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
seventeen 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
almost 1
younger 1
than 1
that 1
she 1
looked 1
such 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
little 1
about 1
acting 1
dorian 1
you 1
mustnt 1
let 1
this 1
thing 1
get 1
on 1
your 1
nerves 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
afterwards 1
we 1
will 1
look 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
patti 1
night 1
and 1
everybody 1
will 1
be 1
there 1
you 1
can 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
sisters 1
box 1
she 1
has 1
got 1
some 1
smart 1
women 1
with 1
her 1
so 1
i 1
have 1
murdered 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
half 1
to 1
himself 1
murdered 1
her 1
as 1
surely 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
cut 1
her 1
little 1
throat 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
yet 1
the 1
roses 1
are 1
not 1
less 1
lovely 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
birds 1
sing 1
just 1
as 1
happily 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
and 1
tonight 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
sup 1
somewhere 1
i 1
suppose 1
afterwards 1
how 1
extraordinarily 1
dramatic 1
life 1
is 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
all 1
this 1
in 1
a 1
book 1
harry 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
wept 1
over 1
it 1
somehow 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
happened 1
actually 1
and 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
far 1
too 1
wonderful 1
for 1
tears 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
passionate 1
loveletter 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
written 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
strange 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
passionate 1
loveletter 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
addressed 1
to 1
a 1
dead 1
girl 1
can 1
they 1
feel 1
i 1
wonder 1
those 1
white 1
silent 1
people 1
we 1
call 1
the 1
dead 1
sibyl 1
can 1
she 1
feel 1
or 1
know 1
or 1
listen 1
oh 1
harry 1
how 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
once 1
it 1
seems 1
years 1
ago 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
she 1
was 1
everything 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
came 1
that 1
dreadful 1
nightwas 1
it 1
really 1
only 1
last 1
nightwhen 1
she 1
played 1
so 1
badly 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
almost 1
broke 1
she 1
explained 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
terribly 1
pathetic 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
moved 1
a 1
bit 1
i 1
thought 1
her 1
shallow 1
suddenly 1
something 1
happened 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
afraid 1
i 1
cant 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
terrible 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
i 1
felt 1
i 1
had 1
done 1
wrong 1
and 1
now 1
she 1
is 1
dead 1
my 1
god 1
my 1
god 1
harry 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
the 1
danger 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
straight 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
for 1
me 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
kill 1
herself 1
it 1
was 1
selfish 1
of 1
her 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
taking 1
a 1
cigarette 1
from 1
his 1
case 1
and 1
producing 1
a 1
goldlatten 1
matchbox 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
ever 1
reform 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
by 1
boring 1
him 1
so 1
completely 1
that 1
he 1
loses 1
all 1
possible 1
interest 1
in 1
life 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
married 1
this 1
girl 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
wretched 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
treated 1
her 1
kindly 1
one 1
can 1
always 1
be 1
kind 1
to 1
people 1
about 1
whom 1
one 1
cares 1
nothing 1
but 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
soon 1
found 1
out 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
absolutely 1
indifferent 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
finds 1
that 1
out 1
about 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
either 1
becomes 1
dreadfully 1
dowdy 1
or 1
wears 1
very 1
smart 1
bonnets 1
that 1
some 1
other 1
womans 1
husband 1
has 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
i 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
social 1
mistake 1
which 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
abjectwhich 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
allowedbut 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
absolute 1
failure 1
i 1
suppose 1
it 1
would 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
looking 1
horribly 1
pale 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
duty 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
fault 1
that 1
this 1
terrible 1
tragedy 1
has 1
prevented 1
my 1
doing 1
what 1
was 1
right 1
i 1
remember 1
your 1
saying 1
once 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
fatality 1
about 1
good 1
resolutionsthat 1
they 1
are 1
always 1
made 1
too 1
late 1
mine 1
certainly 1
were 1
good 1
resolutions 1
are 1
useless 1
attempts 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
scientific 1
laws 1
their 1
origin 1
is 1
pure 1
vanity 1
their 1
result 1
is 1
absolutely 1
_nil_ 1
they 1
give 1
us 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
luxurious 1
sterile 1
emotions 1
that 1
have 1
a 1
certain 1
charm 1
for 1
the 1
weak 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
are 1
simply 1
cheques 1
that 1
men 1
draw 1
on 1
a 1
bank 1
where 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
account 1
harry 1
cried 1
dorian 1
gray 1
coming 1
over 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
beside 1
him 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
feel 1
this 1
tragedy 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
heartless 1
do 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
too 1
many 1
foolish 1
things 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
fortnight 1
to 1
be 1
entitled 1
to 1
give 1
yourself 1
that 1
name 1
dorian 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
with 1
his 1
sweet 1
melancholy 1
smile 1
the 1
lad 1
frowned 1
i 1
dont 1
like 1
that 1
explanation 1
harry 1
he 1
rejoined 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
heartless 1
i 1
am 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
this 1
thing 1
that 1
has 1
happened 1
does 1
not 1
affect 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
simply 1
like 1
a 1
wonderful 1
ending 1
to 1
a 1
wonderful 1
play 1
it 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
terrible 1
beauty 1
of 1
a 1
greek 1
tragedy 1
a 1
tragedy 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
but 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
wounded 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
interesting 1
question 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
who 1
found 1
an 1
exquisite 1
pleasure 1
in 1
playing 1
on 1
the 1
lads 1
unconscious 1
egotism 1
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
question 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
explanation 1
is 1
this 1
it 1
often 1
happens 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
tragedies 1
of 1
life 1
occur 1
in 1
such 1
an 1
inartistic 1
manner 1
that 1
they 1
hurt 1
us 1
by 1
their 1
crude 1
violence 1
their 1
absolute 1
incoherence 1
their 1
absurd 1
want 1
of 1
meaning 1
their 1
entire 1
lack 1
of 1
style 1
they 1
affect 1
us 1
just 1
as 1
vulgarity 1
affects 1
us 1
they 1
give 1
us 1
an 1
impression 1
of 1
sheer 1
brute 1
force 1
and 1
we 1
revolt 1
against 1
that 1
sometimes 1
however 1
a 1
tragedy 1
that 1
possesses 1
artistic 1
elements 1
of 1
beauty 1
crosses 1
our 1
lives 1
if 1
these 1
elements 1
of 1
beauty 1
are 1
real 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
simply 1
appeals 1
to 1
our 1
sense 1
of 1
dramatic 1
effect 1
suddenly 1
we 1
find 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
no 1
longer 1
the 1
actors 1
but 1
the 1
spectators 1
of 1
the 1
play 1
or 1
rather 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
we 1
watch 1
ourselves 1
and 1
the 1
mere 1
wonder 1
of 1
the 1
spectacle 1
enthralls 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
has 1
really 1
happened 1
some 1
one 1
has 1
killed 1
herself 1
for 1
love 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
wish 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
had 1
such 1
an 1
experience 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
adored 1
methere 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
very 1
many 1
but 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
somehave 1
always 1
insisted 1
on 1
living 1
on 1
long 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
them 1
or 1
they 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
me 1
they 1
have 1
become 1
stout 1
and 1
tedious 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
meet 1
them 1
they 1
go 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
reminiscences 1
that 1
awful 1
memory 1
of 1
woman 1
what 1
a 1
fearful 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
what 1
an 1
utter 1
intellectual 1
stagnation 1
it 1
reveals 1
one 1
should 1
absorb 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
remember 1
its 1
details 1
details 1
are 1
always 1
vulgar 1
i 1
must 1
sow 1
poppies 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
sighed 1
dorian 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
necessity 1
rejoined 1
his 1
companion 1
life 1
has 1
always 1
poppies 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
of 1
course 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
things 1
linger 1
i 1
once 1
wore 1
nothing 1
but 1
violets 1
all 1
through 1
one 1
season 1
as 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
artistic 1
mourning 1
for 1
a 1
romance 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
die 1
ultimately 1
however 1
it 1
did 1
die 1
i 1
forget 1
what 1
killed 1
it 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
proposing 1
to 1
sacrifice 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
for 1
me 1
that 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
dreadful 1
moment 1
it 1
fills 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
eternity 1
wellwould 1
you 1
believe 1
ita 1
week 1
ago 1
at 1
lady 1
hampshires 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
seated 1
at 1
dinner 1
next 1
the 1
lady 1
in 1
question 1
and 1
she 1
insisted 1
on 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
again 1
and 1
digging 1
up 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
raking 1
up 1
the 1
future 1
i 1
had 1
buried 1
my 1
romance 1
in 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
asphodel 1
she 1
dragged 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
spoiled 1
her 1
life 1
i 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
she 1
ate 1
an 1
enormous 1
dinner 1
so 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
any 1
anxiety 1
but 1
what 1
a 1
lack 1
of 1
taste 1
she 1
showed 1
the 1
one 1
charm 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
past 1
but 1
women 1
never 1
know 1
when 1
the 1
curtain 1
has 1
fallen 1
they 1
always 1
want 1
a 1
sixth 1
act 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
play 1
is 1
entirely 1
over 1
they 1
propose 1
to 1
continue 1
it 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
allowed 1
their 1
own 1
way 1
every 1
comedy 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
tragic 1
ending 1
and 1
every 1
tragedy 1
would 1
culminate 1
in 1
a 1
farce 1
they 1
are 1
charmingly 1
artificial 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
art 1
you 1
are 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
dorian 1
that 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
me 1
what 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
did 1
for 1
you 1
ordinary 1
women 1
always 1
console 1
themselves 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
do 1
it 1
by 1
going 1
in 1
for 1
sentimental 1
colours 1
never 1
trust 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
wears 1
mauve 1
whatever 1
her 1
age 1
may 1
be 1
or 1
a 1
woman 1
over 1
thirtyfive 1
who 1
is 1
fond 1
of 1
pink 1
ribbons 1
it 1
always 1
means 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
history 1
others 1
find 1
a 1
great 1
consolation 1
in 1
suddenly 1
discovering 1
the 1
good 1
qualities 1
of 1
their 1
husbands 1
they 1
flaunt 1
their 1
conjugal 1
felicity 1
in 1
ones 1
face 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
fascinating 1
of 1
sins 1
religion 1
consoles 1
some 1
its 1
mysteries 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
a 1
flirtation 1
a 1
woman 1
once 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
it 1
besides 1
nothing 1
makes 1
one 1
so 1
vain 1
as 1
being 1
told 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
a 1
sinner 1
conscience 1
makes 1
egotists 1
of 1
us 1
all 1
yes 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
no 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
consolations 1
that 1
women 1
find 1
in 1
modern 1
life 1
indeed 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
mentioned 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
one 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
harry 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
listlessly 1
oh 1
the 1
obvious 1
consolation 1
taking 1
some 1
one 1
elses 1
admirer 1
when 1
one 1
loses 1
ones 1
own 1
in 1
good 1
society 1
that 1
always 1
whitewashes 1
a 1
woman 1
but 1
really 1
dorian 1
how 1
different 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
women 1
one 1
meets 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
about 1
her 1
death 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
i 1
am 1
living 1
in 1
a 1
century 1
when 1
such 1
wonders 1
happen 1
they 1
make 1
one 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
all 1
play 1
with 1
such 1
as 1
romance 1
passion 1
and 1
love 1
i 1
was 1
terribly 1
cruel 1
to 1
her 1
you 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
women 1
appreciate 1
cruelty 1
downright 1
cruelty 1
more 1
than 1
anything 1
else 1
they 1
have 1
wonderfully 1
primitive 1
instincts 1
we 1
have 1
emancipated 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
remain 1
slaves 1
looking 1
for 1
their 1
masters 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
they 1
love 1
being 1
dominated 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
were 1
splendid 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
you 1
really 1
and 1
absolutely 1
angry 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
fancy 1
how 1
delightful 1
you 1
looked 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
you 1
said 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
yesterday 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
merely 1
fanciful 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
now 1
was 1
absolutely 1
true 1
and 1
it 1
holds 1
the 1
key 1
to 1
everything 1
what 1
was 1
that 1
harry 1
you 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
represented 1
to 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
heroines 1
of 1
romancethat 1
she 1
was 1
desdemona 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
ophelia 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
died 1
as 1
juliet 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
life 1
as 1
imogen 1
she 1
will 1
never 1
come 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
now 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
burying 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
no 1
she 1
will 1
never 1
come 1
to 1
life 1
she 1
has 1
played 1
her 1
last 1
part 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
lonely 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
tawdry 1
dressingroom 1
simply 1
as 1
a 1
strange 1
lurid 1
fragment 1
from 1
some 1
jacobean 1
tragedy 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
scene 1
from 1
webster 1
or 1
ford 1
or 1
cyril 1
tourneur 1
the 1
girl 1
never 1
really 1
lived 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
has 1
never 1
really 1
died 1
to 1
you 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
dream 1
a 1
phantom 1
that 1
flitted 1
through 1
shakespeares 1
plays 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
lovelier 1
for 1
its 1
presence 1
a 1
reed 1
through 1
which 1
shakespeares 1
music 1
sounded 1
richer 1
and 1
more 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
the 1
moment 1
she 1
touched 1
actual 1
life 1
she 1
marred 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
marred 1
her 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
passed 1
away 1
mourn 1
for 1
ophelia 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
put 1
ashes 1
on 1
your 1
head 1
because 1
cordelia 1
was 1
strangled 1
cry 1
out 1
against 1
heaven 1
because 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
brabantio 1
died 1
but 1
dont 1
waste 1
your 1
tears 1
over 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
she 1
was 1
less 1
real 1
than 1
they 1
are 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
silence 1
the 1
evening 1
darkened 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
noiselessly 1
and 1
with 1
silver 1
feet 1
the 1
shadows 1
crept 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
colours 1
faded 1
wearily 1
out 1
of 1
things 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
dorian 1
gray 1
looked 1
up 1
you 1
have 1
explained 1
me 1
to 1
myself 1
harry 1
he 1
murmured 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
i 1
felt 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
but 1
somehow 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
express 1
it 1
to 1
myself 1
how 1
well 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
but 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
talk 1
again 1
of 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
marvellous 1
experience 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
life 1
has 1
still 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
anything 1
as 1
marvellous 1
life 1
has 1
everything 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
you 1
dorian 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
that 1
you 1
with 1
your 1
extraordinary 1
good 1
looks 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
suppose 1
harry 1
i 1
became 1
haggard 1
and 1
old 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
what 1
then 1
ah 1
then 1
said 1
lord 1
henry 1
rising 1
to 1
go 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
dorian 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
fight 1
for 1
your 1
victories 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
they 1
are 1
brought 1
to 1
you 1
no 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
your 1
good 1
looks 1
we 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
that 1
reads 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
wise 1
and 1
that 1
thinks 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
beautiful 1
we 1
cannot 1
spare 1
you 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
dress 1
and 1
drive 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
we 1
are 1
rather 1
late 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
shall 1
join 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
harry 1
i 1
feel 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
eat 1
anything 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
your 1
sisters 1
box 1
twentyseven 1
i 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
grand 1
tier 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
her 1
name 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
you 1
wont 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
i 1
dont 1
feel 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
said 1
dorian 1
listlessly 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
awfully 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
are 1
certainly 1
my 1
best 1
friend 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
ever 1
understood 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
we 1
are 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
our 1
friendship 1
dorian 1
answered 1
lord 1
henry 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
goodbye 1
i 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
before 1
ninethirty 1
i 1
hope 1
remember 1
patti 1
is 1
singing 1
as 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
dorian 1
gray 1
touched 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
victor 1
appeared 1
with 1
the 1
lamps 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
blinds 1
down 1
he 1
waited 1
impatiently 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
the 1
man 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
an 1
interminable 1
time 1
over 1
everything 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
he 1
rushed 1
to 1
the 1
screen 1
and 1
drew 1
it 1
back 1
no 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
further 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
sibyl 1
vanes 1
death 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
of 1
it 1
himself 1
it 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
life 1
as 1
they 1
occurred 1
the 1
vicious 1
cruelty 1
that 1
marred 1
the 1
fine 1
lines 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
had 1
drunk 1
the 1
poison 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
or 1
was 1
it 1
indifferent 1
to 1
results 1
did 1
it 1
merely 1
take 1
cognizance 1
of 1
what 1
passed 1
within 1
the 1
soul 1
he 1
wondered 1
and 1
hoped 1
that 1
some 1
day 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
the 1
change 1
taking 1
place 1
before 1
his 1
very 1
eyes 1
shuddering 1
as 1
he 1
hoped 1
it 1
poor 1
sibyl 1
what 1
a 1
romance 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
she 1
had 1
often 1
mimicked 1
death 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
then 1
death 1
himself 1
had 1
touched 1
her 1
and 1
taken 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
how 1
had 1
she 1
played 1
that 1
dreadful 1
last 1
scene 1
had 1
she 1
cursed 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
died 1
no 1
she 1
had 1
died 1
for 1
love 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
love 1
would 1
always 1
be 1
a 1
sacrament 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
she 1
had 1
atoned 1
for 1
everything 1
by 1
the 1
sacrifice 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
any 1
more 1
of 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
go 1
through 1
on 1
that 1
horrible 1
night 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
when 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
tragic 1
figure 1
sent 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
worlds 1
stage 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
supreme 1
reality 1
of 1
love 1
a 1
wonderful 1
tragic 1
figure 1
tears 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
remembered 1
her 1
childlike 1
look 1
and 1
winsome 1
fanciful 1
ways 1
and 1
shy 1
tremulous 1
grace 1
he 1
brushed 1
them 1
away 1
hastily 1
and 1
looked 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
had 1
really 1
come 1
for 1
making 1
his 1
choice 1
or 1
had 1
his 1
choice 1
already 1
been 1
made 1
yes 1
life 1
had 1
decided 1
that 1
for 1
himlife 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
infinite 1
curiosity 1
about 1
life 1
eternal 1
youth 1
infinite 1
passion 1
pleasures 1
subtle 1
and 1
secret 1
wild 1
joys 1
and 1
wilder 1
sinshe 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
the 1
portrait 1
was 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
shame 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
pain 1
crept 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
desecration 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
the 1
fair 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
once 1
in 1
boyish 1
mockery 1
of 1
narcissus 1
he 1
had 1
kissed 1
or 1
feigned 1
to 1
kiss 1
those 1
painted 1
lips 1
that 1
now 1
smiled 1
so 1
cruelly 1
at 1
him 1
morning 1
after 1
morning 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
before 1
the 1
portrait 1
wondering 1
at 1
its 1
beauty 1
almost 1
enamoured 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
alter 1
now 1
with 1
every 1
mood 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
yielded 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
monstrous 1
and 1
loathsome 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
locked 1
room 1
to 1
be 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
sunlight 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
touched 1
to 1
brighter 1
gold 1
the 1
waving 1
wonder 1
of 1
its 1
hair 1
the 1
pity 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
pity 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
praying 1
that 1
the 1
horrible 1
sympathy 1
that 1
existed 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
picture 1
might 1
cease 1
it 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
a 1
prayer 1
perhaps 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
a 1
prayer 1
it 1
might 1
remain 1
unchanged 1
and 1
yet 1
who 1
that 1
knew 1
anything 1
about 1
life 1
would 1
surrender 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
remaining 1
always 1
young 1
however 1
fantastic 1
that 1
chance 1
might 1
be 1
or 1
with 1
what 1
fateful 1
consequences 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
fraught 1
besides 1
was 1
it 1
really 1
under 1
his 1
control 1
had 1
it 1
indeed 1
been 1
prayer 1
that 1
had 1
produced 1
the 1
substitution 1
might 1
there 1
not 1
be 1
some 1
curious 1
scientific 1
reason 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
if 1
thought 1
could 1
exercise 1
its 1
influence 1
upon 1
a 1
living 1
organism 1
might 1
not 1
thought 1
exercise 1
an 1
influence 1
upon 1
dead 1
and 1
inorganic 1
things 1
nay 1
without 1
thought 1
or 1
conscious 1
desire 1
might 1
not 1
things 1
external 1
to 1
ourselves 1
vibrate 1
in 1
unison 1
with 1
our 1
moods 1
and 1
passions 1
atom 1
calling 1
to 1
atom 1
in 1
secret 1
love 1
or 1
strange 1
affinity 1
but 1
the 1
reason 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
tempt 1
by 1
a 1
prayer 1
any 1
terrible 1
power 1
if 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
to 1
alter 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
alter 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
why 1
inquire 1
too 1
closely 1
into 1
it 1
for 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
real 1
pleasure 1
in 1
watching 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
mind 1
into 1
its 1
secret 1
places 1
this 1
portrait 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
magical 1
of 1
mirrors 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
own 1
body 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
reveal 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
and 1
when 1
winter 1
came 1
upon 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
standing 1
where 1
spring 1
trembles 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
summer 1
when 1
the 1
blood 1
crept 1
from 1
its 1
face 1
and 1
left 1
behind 1
a 1
pallid 1
mask 1
of 1
chalk 1
with 1
leaden 1
eyes 1
he 1
would 1
keep 1
the 1
glamour 1
of 1
boyhood 1
not 1
one 1
blossom 1
of 1
his 1
loveliness 1
would 1
ever 1
fade 1
not 1
one 1
pulse 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
would 1
ever 1
weaken 1
like 1
the 1
gods 1
of 1
the 1
greeks 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
strong 1
and 1
fleet 1
and 1
joyous 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
what 1
happened 1
to 1
the 1
coloured 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
safe 1
that 1
was 1
everything 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
former 1
place 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
smiling 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
where 1
his 1
valet 1
was 1
already 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
an 1
hour 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
lord 1
henry 1
was 1
leaning 1
over 1
his 1
chair 1
chapter 1
9 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
at 1
breakfast 1
next 1
morning 1
basil 1
hallward 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
you 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
i 1
called 1
last 1
night 1
and 1
they 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
was 1
impossible 1
but 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
left 1
word 1
where 1
you 1
had 1
really 1
gone 1
to 1
i 1
passed 1
a 1
dreadful 1
evening 1
half 1
afraid 1
that 1
one 1
tragedy 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
by 1
another 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
telegraphed 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
you 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
first 1
i 1
read 1
of 1
it 1
quite 1
by 1
chance 1
in 1
a 1
late 1
edition 1
of 1
_the 1
globe_ 1
that 1
i 1
picked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
i 1
came 1
here 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
was 1
miserable 1
at 1
not 1
finding 1
you 1
i 1
cant 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
heartbroken 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
must 1
suffer 1
but 1
where 1
were 1
you 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
girls 1
mother 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
following 1
you 1
there 1
they 1
gave 1
the 1
address 1
in 1
the 1
paper 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
euston 1
road 1
isnt 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
intruding 1
upon 1
a 1
sorrow 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
lighten 1
poor 1
woman 1
what 1
a 1
state 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
and 1
her 1
only 1
child 1
too 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
about 1
it 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
how 1
do 1
i 1
know 1
murmured 1
dorian 1
gray 1
sipping 1
some 1
paleyellow 1
wine 1
from 1
a 1
delicate 1
goldbeaded 1
bubble 1
of 1
venetian 1
glass 1
and 1
looking 1
dreadfully 1
bored 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
come 1
on 1
there 1
i 1
met 1
lady 1
gwendolen 1
harrys 1
sister 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
box 1
she 1
is 1
perfectly 1
charming 1
and 1
patti 1
sang 1
divinely 1
dont 1
talk 1
about 1
horrid 1
subjects 1
if 1
one 1
doesnt 1
talk 1
about 1
a 1
thing 1
it 1
has 1
never 1
happened 1
it 1
is 1
simply 1
expression 1
as 1
harry 1
says 1
that 1
gives 1
reality 1
to 1
things 1
i 1
may 1
mention 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
womans 1
only 1
child 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
son 1
a 1
charming 1
fellow 1
i 1
believe 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
sailor 1
or 1
something 1
and 1
now 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
yourself 1
and 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
painting 1
you 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
said 1
hallward 1
speaking 1
very 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
strained 1
touch 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
you 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
while 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
was 1
lying 1
dead 1
in 1
some 1
sordid 1
lodging 1
you 1
can 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
of 1
other 1
women 1
being 1
charming 1
and 1
of 1
patti 1
singing 1
divinely 1
before 1
the 1
girl 1
you 1
loved 1
has 1
even 1
the 1
quiet 1
of 1
a 1
grave 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
why 1
man 1
there 1
are 1
horrors 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
that 1
little 1
white 1
body 1
of 1
hers 1
stop 1
basil 1
i 1
wont 1
hear 1
it 1
cried 1
dorian 1
leaping 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
things 1
what 1
is 1
done 1
is 1
done 1
what 1
is 1
past 1
is 1
past 1
you 1
call 1
yesterday 1
the 1
past 1
what 1
has 1
the 1
actual 1
lapse 1
of 1
time 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
shallow 1
people 1
who 1
require 1
years 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
an 1
emotion 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
master 1
of 1
himself 1
can 1
end 1
a 1
sorrow 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
invent 1
a 1
pleasure 1
i 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
my 1
emotions 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
use 1
them 1
to 1
enjoy 1
them 1
and 1
to 1
dominate 1
them 1
dorian 1
this 1
is 1
horrible 1
something 1
has 1
changed 1
you 1
completely 1
you 1
look 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
wonderful 1
boy 1
who 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
my 1
studio 1
to 1
sit 1
for 1
his 1
picture 1
but 1
you 1
were 1
simple 1
natural 1
and 1
affectionate 1
then 1
you 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
unspoiled 1
creature 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
now 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
come 1
over 1
you 1
you 1
talk 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
no 1
heart 1
no 1
pity 1
in 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
harrys 1
influence 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
lad 1
flushed 1
up 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
looked 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
on 1
the 1
green 1
flickering 1
sunlashed 1
garden 1
i 1
owe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
to 1
harry 1
basil 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
owe 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
only 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
vain 1
well 1
i 1
am 1
punished 1
for 1
that 1
dorianor 1
shall 1
be 1
some 1
day 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
basil 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
turning 1
round 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
dorian 1
gray 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
paint 1
said 1
the 1
artist 1
sadly 1
basil 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
too 1
late 1
yesterday 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
that 1
sibyl 1
vane 1
had 1
killed 1
herself 1
killed 1
herself 1
good 1
heavens 1
is 1
there 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
that 1
cried 1
hallward 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
horror 1
my 1
dear 1
basil 1
surely 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
vulgar 1
accident 1
of 1
course 1
she 1
killed 1
herself 1
the 1
elder 1
man 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
how 1
fearful 1
he 1
muttered 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
no 1
said 1
dorian 1
gray 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
fearful 1
about 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
romantic 1
tragedies 1
of 1
the 1
age 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
people 1
who 1
act 1
lead 1
the 1
most 1
commonplace 1
lives 1
they 1
are 1
good 1
husbands 1
or 1
faithful 1
wives 1
or 1
something 1
tedious 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
meanmiddleclass 1
virtue 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
how 1
different 1
sibyl 1
was 1
she 1
lived 1
her 1
finest 1
tragedy 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
heroine 1
the 1
last 1
night 1
she 1
playedthe 1
night 1
you 1
saw 1
hershe 1
acted 1
badly 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
known 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
love 1
when 1
she 1
knew 1
its 1
unreality 1
she 1
died 1
as 1
juliet 1
might 1
have 1
died 1
she 1
passed 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
sphere 1
of 1
art 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
martyr 1
about 1
her 1
her 1
death 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
pathetic 1
uselessness 1
of 1
martyrdom 1
all 1
its 1
wasted 1
beauty 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
saying 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
suffered 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
yesterday 1
at 1
a 1
particular 1
momentabout 1
halfpast 1
five 1
perhaps 1
or 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
sixyou 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
me 1
in 1
tears 1
even 1
harry 1
who 1
was 1
here 1
who 1
brought 1
me 1
the 1
news 1
in 1
fact 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
through 1
i 1
suffered 1
immensely 1
then 1
it 1
passed 1
away 1
i 1
cannot 1
repeat 1
an 1
emotion 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
except 1
sentimentalists 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
awfully 1
unjust 1
basil 1
you 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
to 1
console 1
me 1
that 1
is 1
charming 1
of 1
you 1
you 1
find 1
me 1
consoled 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
furious 1
how 1
like 1
a 1
sympathetic 1
person 1
you 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
a 1
story 1
harry 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
a 1
certain 1
philanthropist 1
who 1
spent 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
grievance 1
redressed 1
or 1
some 1
unjust 1
law 1
alteredi 1
forget 1
exactly 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
finally 1
he 1
succeeded 1
and 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
his 1
disappointment 1
he 1
had 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
almost 1
died 1
of 1
_ennui_ 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
confirmed 1
misanthrope 1
and 1
besides 1
my 1
dear 1
old 1
basil 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
want 1
to 1
console 1
me 1
teach 1
me 1
rather 1
to 1
forget 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
from 1
a 1
proper 1
artistic 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
was 1
it 1
not 1
gautier 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
write 1
about 1
_la 1
consolation 1
des 1
arts_ 1
i 1
remember 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
vellumcovered 1
book 1
in 1
your 1
studio 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
chancing 1
on 1
that 1
delightful 1
phrase 1
well 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
like 1
that 1
young 1
man 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
down 1
at 1
marlow 1
together 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
yellow 1
satin 1
could 1
console 1
one 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
miseries 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
love 1
beautiful 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
touch 1
and 1
handle 1
old 1
brocades 1
green 1
bronzes 1
lacquerwork 1
carved 1
ivories 1
exquisite 1
surroundings 1
luxury 1
pompthere 1
is 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
from 1
all 1
these 1
but 1
the 1
artistic 1
temperament 1
that 1
they 1
create 1
or 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
reveal 1
is 1
still 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
spectator 1
of 1
ones 1
own 1
life 1
as 1
harry 1
says 1
is 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
suffering 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
talking 1
to 1
you 1
like 1
this 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
realized 1
how 1
i 1
have 1
developed 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
schoolboy 1
when 1
you 1
knew 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
new 1
passions 1
new 1
thoughts 1
new 1
ideas 1
i 1
am 1
different 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
like 1
me 1
less 1
i 1
am 1
changed 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
my 1
friend 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
harry 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
he 1
is 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
strongeryou 1
are 1
too 1
much 1
afraid 1
of 1
lifebut 1
you 1
are 1
better 1
and 1
how 1
happy 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
together 1
dont 1
leave 1
me 1
basil 1
and 1
dont 1
quarrel 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
felt 1
strangely 1
moved 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
infinitely 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
personality 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
great 1
turning 1
point 1
in 1
his 1
art 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
reproaching 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
after 1
all 1
his 1
indifference 1
was 1
probably 1
merely 1
a 1
mood 1
that 1
would 1
pass 1
away 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
good 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
noble 1
well 1
dorian 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
length 1
with 1
a 1
sad 1
smile 1
i 1
wont 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
about 1
this 1
horrible 1
thing 1
after 1
today 1
i 1
only 1
trust 1
your 1
name 1
wont 1
be 1
mentioned 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
inquest 1
is 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
this 1
afternoon 1
have 1
they 1
summoned 1
you 1
dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
annoyance 1
passed 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
at 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
inquest 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
crude 1
and 1
vulgar 1
about 1
everything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
they 1
dont 1
know 1
my 1
name 1
he 1
answered 1
but 1
surely 1
she 1
did 1
only 1
my 1
christian 1
name 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
she 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
rather 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
who 1
i 1
was 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
invariably 1
told 1
them 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
prince 1
charming 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
of 1
her 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
drawing 1
of 1
sibyl 1
basil 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
than 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
kisses 1
and 1
some 1
broken 1
pathetic 1
words 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
and 1
do 1
something 1
dorian 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
please 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
sit 1
to 1
me 1
yourself 1
again 1
i 1
cant 1
get 1
on 1
without 1
you 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
sit 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
basil 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
starting 1
back 1
the 1
painter 1
stared 1
at 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
what 1
nonsense 1
he 1
cried 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
dont 1
like 1
what 1
i 1
did 1
of 1
you 1
where 1
is 1
it 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
pulled 1
the 1
screen 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
let 1
me 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
do 1
take 1
the 1
screen 1
away 1
dorian 1
it 1
is 1
simply 1
disgraceful 1
of 1
your 1
servant 1
hiding 1
my 1
work 1
like 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
room 1
looked 1
different 1
as 1
i 1
came 1
in 1
my 1
servant 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
basil 1
you 1
dont 1
imagine 1
i 1
let 1
him 1
arrange 1
my 1
room 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
settles 1
my 1
flowers 1
for 1
me 1
sometimesthat 1
is 1
all 1
no 1
i 1
did 1
it 1
myself 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
on 1
the 1
portrait 1
too 1
strong 1
surely 1
not 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
admirable 1
place 1
for 1
it 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
hallward 1
walked 1
towards 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
terror 1
broke 1
from 1
dorian 1
grays 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
rushed 1
between 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
the 1
screen 1
basil 1
he 1
said 1
looking 1
very 1
pale 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
i 1
dont 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
work 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
why 1
shouldnt 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
hallward 1
laughing 1
if 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
basil 1
on 1
my 1
word 1
of 1
honour 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
live 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
serious 1
i 1
dont 1
offer 1
any 1
explanation 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
any 1
but 1
remember 1
if 1
you 1
touch 1
this 1
screen 1
everything 1
is 1
over 1
between 1
us 1
hallward 1
was 1
thunderstruck 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
dorian 1
gray 1
in 1
absolute 1
amazement 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
him 1
like 1
this 1
before 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
actually 1
pallid 1
with 1
rage 1
his 1
hands 1
were 1
clenched 1
and 1
the 1
pupils 1
of 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
like 1
disks 1
of 1
blue 1
fire 1
he 1
was 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
dorian 1
dont 1
speak 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
wont 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
dont 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
he 1
said 1
rather 1
coldly 1
turning 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
going 1
over 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
but 1
really 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
absurd 1
that 1
i 1
shouldnt 1
see 1
my 1
own 1
work 1
especially 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
exhibit 1
it 1
in 1
paris 1
in 1
the 1
autumn 1
i 1
shall 1
probably 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
another 1
coat 1
of 1
varnish 1
before 1
that 1
so 1
i 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
and 1
why 1
not 1
today 1
to 1
exhibit 1
it 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
exhibit 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
dorian 1
gray 1
a 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
terror 1
creeping 1
over 1
him 1
was 1
the 1
world 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
shown 1
his 1
secret 1
were 1
people 1
to 1
gape 1
at 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
that 1
was 1
impossible 1
somethinghe 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
whathad 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
at 1
once 1
yes 1
i 1
dont 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
object 1
to 1
that 1
georges 1
petit 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
collect 1
all 1
my 1
best 1
pictures 1
for 1
a 1
special 1
exhibition 1
in 1
the 1
rue 1
de 1
seze 1
which 1
will 1
open 1
the 1
first 1
week 1
in 1
october 1
the 1
portrait 1
will 1
only 1
be 1
away 1
a 1
month 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
easily 1
spare 1
it 1
for 1
that 1
time 1
in 1
fact 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
keep 1
it 1
always 1
behind 1
a 1
screen 1
you 1
cant 1
care 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
dorian 1
gray 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
there 1
were 1
beads 1
of 1
perspiration 1
there 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
a 1
horrible 1
danger 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
a 1
month 1
ago 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
exhibit 1
it 1
he 1
cried 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
changed 1
your 1
mind 1
you 1
people 1
who 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
being 1
consistent 1
have 1
just 1
as 1
many 1
moods 1
as 1
others 1
have 1
the 1
only 1
difference 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
moods 1
are 1
rather 1
meaningless 1
you 1
cant 1
have 1
forgotten 1
that 1
you 1
assured 1
me 1
most 1
solemnly 1
that 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
induce 1
you 1
to 1
send 1
it 1
to 1
any 1
exhibition 1
you 1
told 1
harry 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
he 1
stopped 1
suddenly 1
and 1
a 1
gleam 1
of 1
light 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
half 1
seriously 1
and 1
half 1
in 1
jest 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
strange 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
get 1
basil 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
why 1
he 1
wont 1
exhibit 1
your 1
picture 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
why 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
revelation 1
to 1
me 1
yes 1
perhaps 1
basil 1
too 1
had 1
his 1
secret 1
he 1
would 1
ask 1
him 1
and 1
try 1
basil 1
he 1
said 1
coming 1
over 1
quite 1
close 1
and 1
looking 1
him 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
we 1
have 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
a 1
secret 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
yours 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
mine 1
what 1
was 1
your 1
reason 1
for 1
refusing 1
to 1
exhibit 1
my 1
picture 1
the 1
painter 1
shuddered 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
dorian 1
if 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
you 1
might 1
like 1
me 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
certainly 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
your 1
doing 1
either 1
of 1
those 1
two 1
things 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
me 1
never 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
picture 1
again 1
i 1
am 1
content 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
you 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
the 1
best 1
work 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
am 1
satisfied 1
your 1
friendship 1
is 1
dearer 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
any 1
fame 1
or 1
reputation 1
no 1
basil 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
insisted 1
dorian 1
gray 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
his 1
feeling 1
of 1
terror 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
curiosity 1
had 1
taken 1
its 1
place 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
basil 1
hallwards 1
mystery 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
looking 1
troubled 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
just 1
answer 1
me 1
one 1
question 1
have 1
you 1
noticed 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
something 1
curioussomething 1
that 1
probably 1
at 1
first 1
did 1
not 1
strike 1
you 1
but 1
that 1
revealed 1
itself 1
to 1
you 1
suddenly 1
basil 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
clutching 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
trembling 1
hands 1
and 1
gazing 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
wild 1
startled 1
eyes 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
did 1
dont 1
speak 1
wait 1
till 1
you 1
hear 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
dorian 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
your 1
personality 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
influence 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
dominated 1
soul 1
brain 1
and 1
power 1
by 1
you 1
you 1
became 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
visible 1
incarnation 1
of 1
that 1
unseen 1
ideal 1
whose 1
memory 1
haunts 1
us 1
artists 1
like 1
an 1
exquisite 1
dream 1
i 1
worshipped 1
you 1
i 1
grew 1
jealous 1
of 1
every 1
one 1
to 1
whom 1
you 1
spoke 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
you 1
all 1
to 1
myself 1
i 1
was 1
only 1
happy 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
with 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
you 1
were 1
still 1
present 1
in 1
my 1
art 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
never 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
this 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
impossible 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
it 1
i 1
hardly 1
understood 1
it 1
myself 1
i 1
only 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
perfection 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
had 1
become 1
wonderful 1
to 1
my 1
eyestoo 1
wonderful 1
perhaps 1
for 1
in 1
such 1
mad 1
worships 1
there 1
is 1
peril 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
losing 1
them 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
keeping 1
them 1
weeks 1
and 1
weeks 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
i 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
absorbed 1
in 1
you 1
then 1
came 1
a 1
new 1
development 1
i 1
had 1
drawn 1
you 1
as 1
paris 1
in 1
dainty 1
armour 1
and 1
as 1
adonis 1
with 1
huntsmans 1
cloak 1
and 1
polished 1
boarspear 1
crowned 1
with 1
heavy 1
lotusblossoms 1
you 1
had 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
prow 1
of 1
adrians 1
barge 1
gazing 1
across 1
the 1
green 1
turbid 1
nile 1
you 1
had 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
still 1
pool 1
of 1
some 1
greek 1
woodland 1
and 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
waters 1
silent 1
silver 1
the 1
marvel 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
face 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
what 1
art 1
should 1
beunconscious 1
ideal 1
and 1
remote 1
one 1
day 1
a 1
fatal 1
day 1
i 1
sometimes 1
think 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
paint 1
a 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
actually 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
dead 1
ages 1
but 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
dress 1
and 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
time 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
realism 1
of 1
the 1
method 1
or 1
the 1
mere 1
wonder 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
personality 1
thus 1
directly 1
presented 1
to 1
me 1
without 1
mist 1
or 1
veil 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
worked 1
at 1
it 1
every 1
flake 1
and 1
film 1
of 1
colour 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
reveal 1
my 1
secret 1
i 1
grew 1
afraid 1
that 1
others 1
would 1
know 1
of 1
my 1
idolatry 1
i 1
felt 1
dorian 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
told 1
too 1
much 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
put 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
into 1
it 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
resolved 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
the 1
picture 1
to 1
be 1
exhibited 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
but 1
then 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
realize 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
meant 1
to 1
me 1
harry 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
talked 1
about 1
it 1
laughed 1
at 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
finished 1
and 1
i 1
sat 1
alone 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
well 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
the 1
thing 1
left 1
my 1
studio 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
intolerable 1
fascination 1
of 1
its 1
presence 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
foolish 1
in 1
imagining 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
anything 1
in 1
it 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
extremely 1
goodlooking 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
paint 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
feeling 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
mistake 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
passion 1
one 1
feels 1
in 1
creation 1
is 1
ever 1
really 1
shown 1
in 1
the 1
work 1
one 1
creates 1
art 1
is 1
always 1
more 1
abstract 1
than 1
we 1
fancy 1
form 1
and 1
colour 1
tell 1
us 1
of 1
form 1
and 1
colourthat 1
is 1
all 1
it 1
often 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
art 1
conceals 1
the 1
artist 1
far 1
more 1
completely 1
than 1
it 1
ever 1
reveals 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
this 1
offer 1
from 1
paris 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
make 1
your 1
portrait 1
the 1
principal 1
thing 1
in 1
my 1
exhibition 1
it 1
never 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
refuse 1
i 1
see 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
right 1
the 1
picture 1
cannot 1
be 1
shown 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
angry 1
with 1
me 1
dorian 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
harry 1
once 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
to 1
be 1
worshipped 1
dorian 1
gray 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
the 1
colour 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
cheeks 1
and 1
a 1
smile 1
played 1
about 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
peril 1
was 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
yet 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
feeling 1
infinite 1
pity 1
for 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
made 1
this 1
strange 1
confession 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
ever 1
be 1
so 1
dominated 1
by 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
lord 1
henry 1
had 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
being 1
very 1
dangerous 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
clever 1
and 1
too 1
cynical 1
to 1
be 1
really 1
fond 1
of 1
would 1
there 1
ever 1
be 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
fill 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
idolatry 1
was 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
life 1
had 1
in 1
store 1
it 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
to 1
me 1
dorian 1
said 1
hallward 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
in 1
the 1
portrait 1
did 1
you 1
really 1
see 1
it 1
i 1
saw 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
answered 1
something 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
very 1
curious 1
well 1
you 1
dont 1
mind 1
my 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
thing 1
now 1
dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
that 1
basil 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
let 1
you 1
stand 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
that 1
picture 1
you 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
surely 1
