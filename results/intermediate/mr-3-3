if 1
you 1
can 1
do 1

where 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
asked 1
the 1
dwarf 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
know 1
then 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
kindly 1
and 1
are 1
wise 1
enough 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
advice 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
and 1
where 1
to 1
go 1
the 1
water 1
you 1
seek 1
springs 1
from 1
a 1
well 1
in 1
an 1
enchanted 1
castle 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
safety 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
iron 1
wand 1
and 1
two 1
little 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
strike 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
three 1
times 1
with 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
open 1
two 1
hungry 1
lions 1
will 1
be 1
lying 1
down 1
inside 1
gaping 1
for 1
their 1
prey 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
throw 1
them 1
the 1
bread 1
they 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
pass 1
then 1
hasten 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
take 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
before 1
the 1
clock 1
strikes 1
twelve 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
tarry 1
longer 1
the 1
door 1
will 1
shut 1
upon 1
you 1
for 1
ever 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
thanked 1
his 1
little 1
friend 1
with 1
the 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
for 1
his 1
friendly 1
aid 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
went 1
travelling 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
over 1
sea 1
and 1
over 1
land 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
journeys 1
end 1
and 1
found 1
everything 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
at 1
the 1
third 1
stroke 1
of 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
lions 1
were 1
quieted 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
length 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
hall 1
around 1
it 1
he 1
saw 1
several 1
knights 1
sitting 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
then 1
he 1
pulled 1
off 1
their 1
rings 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
fingers 1
in 1
another 1
room 1
he 1
saw 1
on 1
a 1
table 1
a 1
sword 1
and 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
which 1
he 1
also 1
took 1
further 1
on 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
where 1
a 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
sat 1
upon 1
a 1
couch 1
and 1
she 1
welcomed 1
him 1
joyfully 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
set 1
her 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
spell 1
that 1
bound 1
her 1
the 1
kingdom 1
should 1
be 1
his 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
marry 1
her 1
then 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
well 1
that 1
held 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
palace 1
gardens 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
draw 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
before 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
twelve 1
he 1
walked 1
on 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
through 1
beautiful 1
gardens 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
delightful 1
shady 1
spot 1
in 1
which 1
stood 1
a 1
couch 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
tired 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
rest 1
himself 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
gaze 1
on 1
the 1
lovely 1
scenes 1
around 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
sleep 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
unawares 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wake 1
up 1
till 1
the 1
clock 1
was 1
striking 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
twelve 1
then 1
he 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
dreadfully 1
frightened 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
filled 1
a 1
cup 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
him 1
full 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
hastened 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
in 1
time 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
fell 1
so 1
quickly 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
snapped 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
his 1
heel 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
safe 1
he 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
homewards 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
sword 1
and 1
the 1
loaf 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
noble 1
prize 1
with 1
the 1
sword 1
you 1
can 1
at 1
a 1
blow 1
slay 1
whole 1
armies 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
will 1
never 1
fail 1
you 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
cannot 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
without 1
my 1
brothers 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
cannot 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
my 1
two 1
brothers 1
are 1
who 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
i 1
have 1
shut 1
them 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
charm 1
between 1
two 1
mountains 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
because 1
they 1
were 1
proud 1
and 1
illbehaved 1
and 1
scorned 1
to 1
ask 1
advice 1
the 1
prince 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
for 1
his 1
brothers 1
that 1
the 1
dwarf 1
at 1
last 1
set 1
them 1
free 1
though 1
unwillingly 1
saying 1
beware 1
of 1
them 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
bad 1
hearts 1
their 1
brother 1
however 1
was 1
greatly 1
rejoiced 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
cup 1
full 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
a 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
free 1
from 1
a 1
spell 1
that 1
bound 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
engaged 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
kingdom 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
three 1
rode 1
on 1
together 1
and 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
country 1
that 1
was 1
laid 1
waste 1
by 1
war 1
and 1
a 1
dreadful 1
famine 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
feared 1
all 1
must 1
die 1
for 1
want 1
but 1
the 1
prince 1
gave 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
lent 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
wonderful 1
sword 1
and 1
he 1
slew 1
the 1
enemys 1
army 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
the 1
kingdom 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
plenty 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
he 1
befriended 1
two 1
other 1
countries 1
through 1
which 1
they 1
passed 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
they 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
during 1
their 1
voyage 1
the 1
two 1
eldest 1
said 1
to 1
themselves 1
our 1
brother 1
has 1
got 1
the 1
water 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
therefore 1
our 1
father 1
will 1
forsake 1
us 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
kingdom 1
which 1
is 1
our 1
right 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
envy 1
and 1
revenge 1
and 1
agreed 1
together 1
how 1
they 1
could 1
ruin 1
him 1
then 1
they 1
waited 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
poured 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cup 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
for 1
themselves 1
giving 1
him 1
bitter 1
seawater 1
instead 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
their 1
journeys 1
end 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
brought 1
his 1
cup 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
king 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
drink 1
and 1
be 1
healed 1
scarcely 1
however 1
had 1
he 1
tasted 1
the 1
bitter 1
seawater 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
worse 1
even 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
and 1
then 1
both 1
the 1
elder 1
sons 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
blamed 1
the 1
youngest 1
for 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
poison 1
their 1
father 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
with 1
them 1
he 1
no 1
sooner 1
began 1
to 1
drink 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
brought 1
him 1
than 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
sickness 1
leave 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
as 1
strong 1
and 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
their 1
brother 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
well 1
brother 1
you 1
found 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
did 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
trouble 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
reward 1
pray 1
with 1
all 1
your 1
cleverness 1
why 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
manage 1
to 1
keep 1
your 1
eyes 1
open 1
next 1
year 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
will 1
take 1
away 1
your 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
this 1
to 1
our 1
father 1
for 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
believe 1
a 1
word 1
you 1
say 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
tell 1
tales 1
you 1
shall 1
lose 1
your 1
life 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
but 1
be 1
quiet 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
off 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
still 1
very 1
angry 1
with 1
his 1
youngest 1
son 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
really 1
meant 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
away 1
his 1
life 1
so 1
he 1
called 1
his 1
court 1
together 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
should 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
all 1
agreed 1
that 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
prince 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
till 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
kings 1
chief 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
ahunting 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
together 1
the 1
huntsman 1
looked 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
that 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
and 1
dare 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
the 1
prince 1
begged 1
very 1
hard 1
and 1
said 1
only 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
angry 1
for 1
i 1
will 1
forgive 1
you 1
alas 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
the 1
king 1
has 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
shoot 1
you 1
the 1
prince 1
started 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
said 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
change 1
dresses 1
with 1
you 1
you 1
shall 1
take 1
my 1
royal 1
coat 1
to 1
show 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
your 1
shabby 1
one 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
save 1
you 1
for 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
shot 1
you 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
princes 1
coat 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
shabby 1
one 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
some 1
time 1
after 1
three 1
grand 1
embassies 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
kings 1
court 1
with 1
rich 1
gifts 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
precious 1
stones 1
for 1
his 1
youngest 1
son 1
now 1
all 1
these 1
were 1
sent 1
from 1
the 1
three 1
kings 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
lent 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
rid 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
enemy 1
and 1
feed 1
their 1
people 1
this 1
touched 1
the 1
old 1
kings 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
his 1
son 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
guiltless 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
court 1
o 1
that 1
my 1
son 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
how 1
it 1
grieves 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
him 1
killed 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
alive 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
but 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
his 1
royal 1
coat 1
at 1
this 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
throughout 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
that 1
if 1
his 1
son 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
court 1
he 1
would 1
forgive 1
him 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
eagerly 1
waiting 1
till 1
her 1
deliverer 1
should 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
road 1
made 1
leading 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
palace 1
all 1
of 1
shining 1
gold 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
courtiers 1
that 1
whoever 1
came 1
on 1
horseback 1
and 1
rode 1
straight 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
upon 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
true 1
lover 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
but 1
whoever 1
rode 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
sure 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
one 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
time 1
soon 1
came 1
when 1
the 1
eldest 1
brother 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
haste 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
set 1
her 1
free 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
kingdom 1
with 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
before 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
golden 1
road 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
to 1
ride 1
upon 1
this 1
beautiful 1
road 1
so 1
he 1
turned 1
aside 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
righthand 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
the 1
guards 1
who 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
road 1
he 1
took 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
must 1
go 1
about 1
his 1
business 1
the 1
second 1
prince 1
set 1
out 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
errand 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
road 1
and 1
his 1
horse 1
had 1
set 1
one 1
foot 1
upon 1
it 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
very 1
beautiful 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
what 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
anything 1
should 1
tread 1
here 1
then 1
he 1
too 1
turned 1
aside 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
the 1
guards 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
prince 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
too 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
about 1
his 1
business 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
full 1
year 1
was 1
come 1
round 1
the 1
third 1
brother 1
left 1
the 1
forest 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
lain 1
hid 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
his 1
fathers 1
anger 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
his 1
betrothed 1
bride 1
so 1
he 1
journeyed 1
on 1
thinking 1
of 1
her 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
rode 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
but 1
went 1
with 1
his 1
horse 1
straight 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
it 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
welcomed 1
him 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
her 1
deliverer 1
and 1
should 1
now 1
be 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
joy 1
at 1
their 1
meeting 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
princess 1
told 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
having 1
forgiven 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
his 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
home 1
again 1
so 1
before 1
his 1
wedding 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
his 1
father 1
taking 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
how 1
his 1
brothers 1
had 1
cheated 1
and 1
robbed 1
him 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
borne 1
all 1
those 1
wrongs 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
punish 1
his 1
wicked 1
sons 1
but 1
they 1
made 1
their 1
escape 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
sailed 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
wide 1
sea 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
nobody 1
knew 1
and 1
nobody 1
cared 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
gathered 1
together 1
his 1
court 1
and 1
asked 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
celebrate 1
the 1
wedding 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
young 1
and 1
old 1
noble 1
and 1
squire 1
gentle 1
and 1
simple 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
on 1
the 1
summons 1
and 1
among 1
the 1
rest 1
came 1
the 1
friendly 1
dwarf 1
with 1
the 1
sugarloaf 1
hat 1
and 1
a 1
new 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
the 1
merry 1
bells 1
run 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
people 1
they 1
danced 1
and 1
they 1
sung 1
and 1
feasted 1
and 1
frolickd 1
i 1
cant 1
tell 1
how 1
long 1
the 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
kings 1
son 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
bride 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
very 1
happy 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
lay 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
and 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
before 1
his 1
end 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
beloved 1
i 1
must 1
now 1
go 1
and 1
leave 1
you 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
ring 1
as 1
a 1
remembrance 1
of 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
king 1
i 1
will 1
return 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
so 1
he 1
rode 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
dangerously 1
ill 1
and 1
near 1
his 1
death 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
dear 1
son 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
once 1
again 1
before 1
my 1
end 1
promise 1
me 1
to 1
marry 1
as 1
i 1
wish 1
and 1
he 1
named 1
a 1
certain 1
kings 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
trouble 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
and 1
said 1
yes 1
dear 1
father 1
your 1
will 1
shall 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
thereupon 1
the 1
king 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
when 1
therefore 1
the 1
son 1
had 1
been 1
proclaimed 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
mourning 1
was 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
promise 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
caused 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
to 1
be 1
asked 1
in 1
marriage 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
promised 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
first 1
betrothed 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
fretted 1
so 1
much 1
about 1
his 1
faithfulness 1
that 1
she 1
nearly 1
died 1
then 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
dearest 1
child 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
whatsoever 1
you 1
will 1
she 1
thought 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
father 1
i 1
wish 1
for 1
eleven 1
girls 1
exactly 1
like 1
myself 1
in 1
face 1
figure 1
and 1
size 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
your 1
desire 1
shall 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
he 1
caused 1
a 1
search 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
in 1
his 1
whole 1
kingdom 1
until 1
eleven 1
young 1
maidens 1
were 1
found 1
who 1
exactly 1
resembled 1
his 1
daughter 1
in 1
face 1
figure 1
and 1
size 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
she 1
had 1
twelve 1
suits 1
of 1
huntsmens 1
clothes 1
made 1
all 1
alike 1
and 1
the 1
eleven 1
maidens 1
had 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
huntsmens 1
clothes 1
and 1
she 1
herself 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
twelfth 1
suit 1
thereupon 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
rode 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
of 1
her 1
former 1
betrothed 1
whom 1
she 1
loved 1
so 1
dearly 1
then 1
she 1
asked 1
if 1
he 1
required 1
any 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
such 1
handsome 1
fellows 1
he 1
said 1
yes 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
willingly 1
take 1
them 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
kings 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
had 1
a 1
lion 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
wondrous 1
animal 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
all 1
concealed 1
and 1
secret 1
things 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
one 1
evening 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
they 1
are 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
the 1
lion 1
continued 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
they 1
are 1
twelve 1
girls 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
true 1
how 1
will 1
you 1
prove 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
oh 1
just 1
let 1
some 1
peas 1
be 1
strewn 1
in 1
the 1
antechamber 1
answered 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
see 1
men 1
have 1
a 1
firm 1
step 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
walk 1
over 1
peas 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
stir 1
but 1
girls 1
trip 1
and 1
skip 1
and 1
drag 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
peas 1
roll 1
about 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
well 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
counsel 1
and 1
caused 1
the 1
peas 1
to 1
be 1
strewn 1
there 1
was 1
however 1
a 1
servant 1
of 1
the 1
kings 1
who 1
favoured 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
this 1
test 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
repeated 1
everything 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
lion 1
wants 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
king 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
girls 1
then 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
thanked 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
maidens 1
show 1
some 1
strength 1
and 1
step 1
firmly 1
on 1
the 1
peas 1
so 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
called 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
antechamber 1
where 1
the 1
peas 1
were 1
lying 1
they 1
stepped 1
so 1
firmly 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
strong 1
sure 1
walk 1
that 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
peas 1
either 1
rolled 1
or 1
stirred 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
you 1
have 1
lied 1
to 1
me 1
they 1
walk 1
just 1
like 1
men 1
the 1
lion 1
said 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
informed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
the 1
test 1
and 1
have 1
assumed 1
some 1
strength 1
just 1
let 1
twelve 1
spinningwheels 1
be 1
brought 1
into 1
the 1
antechamber 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
be 1
pleased 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
do 1
the 1
king 1
liked 1
the 1
advice 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
spinningwheels 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
antechamber 1
but 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
was 1
well 1
disposed 1
to 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
disclosed 1
the 1
project 1
so 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
eleven 1
girls 1
show 1
some 1
constraint 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
spinningwheels 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
his 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
summoned 1
they 1
went 1
through 1
the 1
antechamber 1
and 1
never 1
once 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
spinningwheels 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
again 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
you 1
have 1
deceived 1
me 1
they 1
are 1
men 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
spinningwheels 1
the 1
lion 1
replied 1
they 1
have 1
restrained 1
themselves 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
believe 1
the 1
lion 1
the 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
always 1
followed 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
his 1
liking 1
for 1
them 1
continually 1
increased 1
now 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
once 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
out 1
hunting 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
the 1
kings 1
bride 1
was 1
approaching 1
when 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
heard 1
that 1
it 1
hurt 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
was 1
almost 1
broken 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
fainting 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
king 1
thought 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
his 1
dear 1
huntsman 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
wanted 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
and 1
drew 1
his 1
glove 1
off 1
then 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
first 1
bride 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
he 1
recognized 1
her 1
then 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
so 1
touched 1
that 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
are 1
mine 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
yours 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
can 1
alter 1
that 1
he 1
sent 1
a 1
messenger 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
bride 1
and 1
entreated 1
her 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
kingdom 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wife 1
already 1
and 1
someone 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
key 1
did 1
not 1
require 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
thereupon 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
again 1
taken 1
into 1
favour 1
because 1
after 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
mountain 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
a 1
son 1
that 1
was 1
very 1
young 1
and 1
barely 1
able 1
to 1
run 1
alone 1
he 1
had 1
two 1
richly 1
laden 1
ships 1
then 1
making 1
a 1
voyage 1
upon 1
the 1
seas 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
embarked 1
all 1
his 1
wealth 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
making 1
great 1
gains 1
when 1
the 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
both 1
were 1
lost 1
thus 1
from 1
being 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
he 1
became 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
very 1
poor 1
that 1
nothing 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
one 1
small 1
plot 1
of 1
land 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
often 1
went 1
in 1
an 1
evening 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
walk 1
and 1
ease 1
his 1
mind 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
roaming 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
brown 1
study 1
thinking 1
with 1
no 1
great 1
comfort 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
what 1
he 1
now 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
there 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
a 1
little 1
roughlooking 1
black 1
dwarf 1
prithee 1
friend 1
why 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
take 1
so 1
deeply 1
to 1
heart 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
me 1
any 1
good 1
i 1
would 1
willingly 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
merchant 1
who 1
knows 1
but 1
i 1
may 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
ails 1
you 1
and 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
use 1
then 1
the 1
merchant 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
all 1
his 1
wealth 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
nothing 1
left 1
but 1
that 1
little 1
plot 1
of 1
land 1
oh 1
trouble 1
not 1
yourself 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
only 1
undertake 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
here 1
twelve 1
years 1
hence 1
whatever 1
meets 1
you 1
first 1
on 1
your 1
going 1
home 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
the 1
merchant 1
thought 1
this 1
was 1
no 1
great 1
thing 1
to 1
ask 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
most 1
likely 1
be 1
his 1
dog 1
or 1
his 1
cat 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
but 1
forgot 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
heinel 1
so 1
he 1
agreed 1
to 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
signed 1
and 1
sealed 1
the 1
bond 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
was 1
asked 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
home 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
crept 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
laid 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
laughed 1
then 1
the 1
father 1
started 1
trembling 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
horror 1
and 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
bound 1
himself 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
as 1
no 1
gold 1
was 1
come 1
he 1
made 1
himself 1
easy 1
by 1
thinking 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
joke 1
that 1
the 1
dwarf 1
was 1
playing 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
when 1
the 1
money 1
came 1
he 1
should 1
see 1
the 1
bearer 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
afterwards 1
he 1
went 1
upstairs 1
into 1
a 1
lumberroom 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
some 1
old 1
iron 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
raise 1
a 1
little 1
money 1
and 1
there 1
instead 1
of 1
his 1
iron 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
large 1
pile 1
of 1
gold 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
and 1
forgetting 1
all 1
about 1
his 1
son 1
went 1
into 1
trade 1
again 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
richer 1
merchant 1
than 1
before 1
meantime 1
little 1
heinel 1
grew 1
up 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
twelve 1
years 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
merchant 1
began 1
to 1
call 1
to 1
mind 1
his 1
bond 1
and 1
became 1
very 1
sad 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
so 1
that 1
care 1
and 1
sorrow 1
were 1
written 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
the 1
boy 1
one 1
day 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
sold 1
him 1
for 1
gold 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
uglylooking 1
black 1
dwarf 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
twelve 1
years 1
were 1
coming 1
round 1
when 1
he 1
must 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
then 1
heinel 1
said 1
father 1
give 1
yourself 1
very 1
little 1
trouble 1
about 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
son 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
agreed 1
upon 1
and 1
the 1
son 1
drew 1
a 1
circle 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
little 1
black 1
dwarf 1
soon 1
came 1
and 1
walked 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
circle 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
any 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
either 1
could 1
not 1
or 1
dared 1
not 1
jump 1
over 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
boy 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
have 1
you 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
us 1
my 1
friend 1
or 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
now 1
heinel 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
friend 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
fairy 1
that 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
this 1
fairy 1
knew 1
what 1
good 1
luck 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
have 1
you 1
brought 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
would 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
held 1
his 1
tongue 1
but 1
heinel 1
said 1
again 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
here 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
your 1
father 1
not 1
with 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
cheated 1
and 1
taken 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
the 1
son 1
pray 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
his 1
bond 1
at 1
once 1
fair 1
and 1
softly 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
right 1
is 1
right 1
i 1
have 1
paid 1
my 1
money 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
has 1
had 1
it 1
and 1
spent 1
it 1
so 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
what 1
i 1
paid 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
my 1
consent 1
to 1
that 1
first 1
said 1
heinel 1
so 1
please 1
to 1
step 1
in 1
here 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
grinned 1
and 1
showed 1
his 1
teeth 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
circle 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
then 1
at 1
last 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
talk 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
terms 1
heinel 1
agreed 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
must 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
that 1
so 1
far 1
the 1
dwarf 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
way 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
the 1
fairy 1
had 1
told 1
heinel 1
what 1
fortune 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
followed 1
his 1
own 1
course 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
choose 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
humpbacked 1
friend 1
who 1
seemed 1
so 1
anxious 1
for 1
his 1
company 1
so 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
drawn 1
battle 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
that 1
heinel 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
into 1
an 1
open 1
boat 1
that 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
hard 1
by 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
should 1
push 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
thus 1
be 1
set 1
adrift 1
and 1
left 1
to 1
the 1
bad 1
or 1
good 1
luck 1
of 1
wind 1
and 1
weather 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
but 1
before 1
it 1
got 1
far 1
off 1
a 1
wave 1
struck 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
with 1
one 1
side 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
the 1
merchant 1
thought 1
that 1
poor 1
heinel 1
was 1
lost 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
while 1
the 1
dwarf 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
thinking 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
his 1
revenge 1
the 1
boat 1
however 1
did 1
not 1
sink 1
for 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
took 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
friend 1
and 1
soon 1
raised 1
the 1
boat 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
went 1
safely 1
on 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sat 1
safe 1
within 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
ran 1
ashore 1
upon 1
an 1
unknown 1
land 1
as 1
he 1
jumped 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
he 1
saw 1
before 1
him 1
a 1
beautiful 1
castle 1
but 1
empty 1
and 1
dreary 1
within 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
enchanted 1
here 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
himself 1
must 1
i 1
find 1
the 1
prize 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
so 1
he 1
once 1
more 1
searched 1
the 1
whole 1
palace 1
through 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
white 1
snake 1
lying 1
coiled 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
cushion 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chambers 1
now 1
the 1
white 1
snake 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
are 1
you 1
at 1
last 1
come 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
twelve 1
long 1
years 1
have 1
i 1
waited 1
here 1
for 1
the 1
fairy 1
to 1
bring 1
you 1
hither 1
as 1
she 1
promised 1
for 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
save 1
me 1
this 1
night 1
twelve 1
men 1
will 1
come 1
their 1
faces 1
will 1
be 1
black 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
dressed 1
in 1
chain 1
armour 1
they 1
will 1
ask 1
what 1
you 1
do 1
here 1
but 1
give 1
no 1
answer 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
willbeat 1
whip 1
pinch 1
prick 1
or 1
torment 1
youbear 1
all 1
only 1
speak 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
at 1
twelve 1
oclock 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
the 1
second 1
night 1
twelve 1
others 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
twentyfour 1
who 1
will 1
even 1
cut 1
off 1
your 1
head 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
twelfth 1
hour 1
of 1
that 1
night 1
their 1
power 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
free 1
and 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
bring 1
you 1
the 1
water 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
will 1
wash 1
you 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
bring 1
you 1
back 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
health 1
and 1
all 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
heinel 1
bore 1
all 1
and 1
spoke 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
came 1
and 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
joy 1
and 1
gladness 1
burst 1
forth 1
throughout 1
the 1
castle 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
crowned 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
mountain 1
they 1
lived 1
together 1
very 1
happily 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
and 1
thus 1
eight 1
years 1
had 1
passed 1
over 1
their 1
heads 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
long 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
but 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
against 1
his 1
going 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
know 1
well 1
that 1
misfortunes 1
will 1
come 1
upon 1
us 1
if 1
you 1
go 1
however 1
he 1
gave 1
her 1
no 1
rest 1
till 1
she 1
agreed 1
at 1
his 1
going 1
away 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
wishingring 1
and 1
said 1
take 1
this 1
ring 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
your 1
finger 1
whatever 1
you 1
wish 1
it 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
only 1
promise 1
never 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
hence 1
to 1
your 1
fathers 1
house 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
what 1
she 1
asked 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
ring 1
on 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
wished 1
himself 1
near 1
the 1
town 1
where 1
his 1
father 1
lived 1
heinel 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
gates 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
the 1
guards 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
in 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
strangely 1
clad 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
hill 1
where 1
a 1
shepherd 1
dwelt 1
and 1
borrowed 1
his 1
old 1
frock 1
and 1
thus 1
passed 1
unknown 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
fathers 1
house 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
son 1
but 1
the 1
merchant 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
son 1
his 1
poor 1
heinel 1
who 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
long 1
since 1
dead 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
dressed 1
like 1
a 1
poor 1
shepherd 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
even 1
give 1
him 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
still 1
vowed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
said 1
is 1
there 1
no 1
mark 1
by 1
which 1
you 1
would 1
know 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
really 1
your 1
son 1
yes 1
said 1
his 1
mother 1
our 1
heinel 1
had 1
a 1
mark 1
like 1
a 1
raspberry 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
then 1
he 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
mark 1
and 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
he 1
next 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
mountain 1
and 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
a 1
princess 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
seven 1
years 1
old 1
but 1
the 1
merchant 1
said 1
that 1
can 1
never 1
be 1
true 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
king 1
truly 1
who 1
travels 1
about 1
in 1
a 1
shepherds 1
frock 1
at 1
this 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
vexed 1
and 1
forgetting 1
his 1
word 1
turned 1
his 1
ring 1
and 1
wished 1
for 1
his 1
queen 1
and 1
son 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
they 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
queen 1
wept 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
broken 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
bad 1
luck 1
would 1
follow 1
he 1
did 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
soothe 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
at 1
last 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
appeased 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
in 1
truth 1
and 1
was 1
only 1
thinking 1
how 1
she 1
should 1
punish 1
him 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
walk 1
with 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
set 1
adrift 1
upon 1
the 1
wide 1
waters 1
then 1
he 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
tired 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
rest 1
my 1
head 1
in 1
your 1
lap 1
and 1
sleep 1
a 1
while 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
however 1
she 1
drew 1
the 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
crept 1
softly 1
away 1
and 1
wished 1
herself 1
and 1
her 1
son 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
their 1
kingdom 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
alone 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
ring 1
was 1
gone 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
fathers 1
house 1
said 1
he 1
they 1
would 1
say 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
sorcerer 1
i 1
will 1
journey 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
till 1
i 1
come 1
again 1
to 1
my 1
kingdom 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
travelled 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
hill 1
where 1
three 1
giants 1
were 1
sharing 1
their 1
fathers 1
goods 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
pass 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
little 1
men 1
have 1
sharp 1
wits 1
he 1
shall 1
part 1
the 1
goods 1
between 1
us 1
now 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sword 1
that 1
cut 1
off 1
an 1
enemys 1
head 1
whenever 1
the 1
wearer 1
gave 1
the 1
words 1
heads 1
off 1
a 1
cloak 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
owner 1
invisible 1
or 1
gave 1
him 1
any 1
form 1
he 1
pleased 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
boots 1
that 1
carried 1
the 1
wearer 1
wherever 1
he 1
wished 1
heinel 1
said 1
they 1
must 1
first 1
let 1
him 1
try 1
these 1
wonderful 1
things 1
then 1
he 1
might 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
value 1
upon 1
them 1
then 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
cloak 1
and 1
he 1
wished 1
himself 1
a 1
fly 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
fly 1
the 1
cloak 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
now 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
sword 1
no 1
said 1
they 1
not 1
unless 1
you 1
undertake 1
not 1
to 1
say 1
heads 1
off 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
dead 1
men 1
so 1
they 1
gave 1
it 1
him 1
charging 1
him 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
he 1
next 1
asked 1
for 1
the 1
boots 1
also 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
all 1
three 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
he 1
wished 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
golden 1
mountain 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
the 1
giants 1
were 1
left 1
behind 1
with 1
no 1
goods 1
to 1
share 1
or 1
quarrel 1
about 1
as 1
heinel 1
came 1
near 1
his 1
castle 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
merry 1
music 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
around 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
queen 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
marry 1
another 1
husband 1
then 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
cloak 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
castle 1
hall 1
and 1
placed 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
queen 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
saw 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
was 1
put 1
upon 1
her 1
plate 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
himself 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
was 1
handed 1
to 1
her 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
drank 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
though 1
they 1
kept 1
on 1
giving 1
her 1
meat 1
and 1
drink 1
her 1
plate 1
and 1
cup 1
were 1
always 1
empty 1
upon 1
this 1
fear 1
and 1
remorse 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
chamber 1
alone 1
and 1
sat 1
there 1
weeping 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
her 1
there 1
alas 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
was 1
i 1
not 1
once 1
set 1
free 1
why 1
then 1
does 1
this 1
enchantment 1
still 1
seem 1
to 1
bind 1
me 1
false 1
and 1
fickle 1
one 1
said 1
he 1
one 1
indeed 1
came 1
who 1
set 1
thee 1
free 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
near 1
thee 1
again 1
but 1
how 1
have 1
you 1
used 1
him 1
ought 1
he 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
such 1
treatment 1
from 1
thee 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
sent 1
away 1
the 1
company 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
kingdom 1
but 1
the 1
princes 1
peers 1
and 1
great 1
men 1
mocked 1
at 1
him 1
however 1
he 1
would 1
enter 1
into 1
no 1
parley 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
only 1
asked 1
them 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
go 1
in 1
peace 1
or 1
not 1
then 1
they 1
turned 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
seize 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
drew 1
his 1
sword 1
heads 1
off 1
cried 1
he 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
word 1
the 1
traitors 1
heads 1
fell 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
heinel 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
mountain 1
doctor 1
knowall 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
poor 1
peasant 1
called 1
crabb 1
who 1
drove 1
with 1
two 1
oxen 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
sold 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
doctor 1
for 1
two 1
talers 1
when 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
being 1
counted 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
sitting 1
at 1
table 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
peasant 1
saw 1
how 1
well 1
he 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
his 1
heart 1
desired 1
what 1
he 1
saw 1
and 1
would 1
willingly 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
doctor 1
too 1
so 1
he 1
remained 1
standing 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
inquired 1
if 1
he 1
too 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
doctor 1
oh 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
is 1
soon 1
managed 1
what 1
must 1
i 1
do 1
asked 1
the 1
peasant 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
buy 1
yourself 1
an 1
a 1
b 1
c 1
book 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
which 1
has 1
a 1
cock 1
on 1
the 1
frontispiece 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
turn 1
your 1
cart 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
oxen 1
into 1
money 1
and 1
get 1
yourself 1
some 1
clothes 1
and 1
whatsoever 1
else 1
pertains 1
to 1

thirdly 1

a 1
sign 1
painted 1
for 1
yourself 1
with 1
the 1
words 1
i 1

doctor 1
knowall 1
and 1
have 1
that 1
nailed 1
up 1
above 1
your 1
housedoor 1
the 1
peasant 1
did 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
doctored 1
people 1
awhile 1
but 1
not 1
long 1
a 1
rich 1
and 1
great 1
lord 1
had 1
some 1
money 1
stolen 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
about 1
doctor 1
knowall 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
village 1
and 1
must 1
know 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
so 1
the 1
lord 1
had 1
the 1
horses 1
harnessed 1
to 1
his 1
carriage 1
drove 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
asked 1
crabb 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
doctor 1
knowall 1
yes 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
said 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
bring 1
back 1
the 1
stolen 1
money 1
oh 1
yes 1
but 1
grete 1
my 1
wife 1
must 1
go 1
too 1
the 1
lord 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
let 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
have 1
a 1
seat 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
drove 1
away 1
together 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
noblemans 1
castle 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
spread 1
and 1
crabb 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
yes 1
but 1
my 1
wife 1
grete 1
too 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
servant 1
came 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
delicate 1
fare 1
the 1
peasant 1
nudged 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
said 1
grete 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
meaning 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
brought 1
the 1
first 1
dish 1
the 1
servant 1
however 1
thought 1
he 1
intended 1
by 1
that 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
thief 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
actually 1
was 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
comrade 1
outside 1
the 1
doctor 1
knows 1
all 1
we 1
shall 1
fare 1
ill 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
the 1
second 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
was 1
forced 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
with 1
his 1
dish 1
the 1
peasant 1
nudged 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
said 1
grete 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
second 1
this 1
servant 1
was 1
equally 1
alarmed 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
the 1
third 1
fared 1
no 1
better 1
for 1
the 1
peasant 1
again 1
said 1
grete 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
third 1
the 1
fourth 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
in 1
a 1
dish 1
that 1
was 1
covered 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
told 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
show 1
his 1
skill 1
and 1
guess 1
what 1
was 1
beneath 1
the 1
cover 1
actually 1
there 1
were 1
crabs 1
the 1
doctor 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
dish 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
cried 1
ah 1
poor 1
crabb 1
when 1
the 1
lord 1
heard 1
that 1
he 1
cried 1
there 1
he 1
knows 1
it 1
he 1
must 1
also 1
know 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
money 1
on 1
this 1
the 1
servants 1
looked 1
terribly 1
uneasy 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
they 1
wished 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
outside 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
therefore 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
all 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
confessed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
stolen 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
willingly 1
restore 1
it 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
heavy 1
sum 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
denounce 1
them 1
for 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
hanged 1
they 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
concealed 1
with 1
this 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
said 1
my 1
lord 1
now 1
will 1
i 1
search 1
in 1
my 1
book 1
where 1
the 1
gold 1
is 1
hidden 1
the 1
fifth 1
servant 1
however 1
crept 1
into 1
the 1
stove 1
to 1
hear 1
if 1
the 1
doctor 1
knew 1
still 1
more 1
but 1
the 1
doctor 1
sat 1
still 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
a 1
b 1
c 1
book 1
turned 1
the 1
pages 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
cock 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
immediately 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
there 1
so 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
come 1
out 1
then 1
the 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
stove 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
meant 1
him 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
sprang 1
out 1
crying 1
that 1
man 1
knows 1
everything 1
then 1
doctor 1
knowall 1
showed 1
the 1
lord 1
where 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
who 1
had 1
stolen 1
it 1
and 1
received 1
from 1
both 1
sides 1
much 1
money 1
in 1
reward 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
renowned 1
man 1
the 1
seven 1
ravens 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
seven 1
sons 1
and 1
last 1
of 1
all 1
one 1
daughter 1
although 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
was 1
very 1
pretty 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
weak 1
and 1
small 1
that 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
at 1
once 1
be 1
christened 1
so 1
the 1
father 1
sent 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
sons 1
in 1
haste 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
water 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
six 1
ran 1
with 1
him 1
each 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
first 1
at 1
drawing 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
that 1
all 1
let 1
their 1
pitchers 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
they 1
stood 1
very 1
foolishly 1
looking 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
none 1
dared 1
go 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
uneasy 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
what 1
made 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
stay 1
so 1
long 1
surely 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
whole 1
seven 1
must 1
have 1
forgotten 1
themselves 1
over 1
some 1
game 1
of 1
play 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
waited 1
still 1
longer 1
and 1
they 1
yet 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
he 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
wished 1
them 1
all 1
turned 1
into 1
ravens 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
spoken 1
these 1
words 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
croaking 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
seven 1
ravens 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
coal 1
flying 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
sorry 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
wish 1
so 1
fulfilled 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
what 1
was 1
done 1
could 1
be 1
undone 1
and 1
comforted 1
himself 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
seven 1
sons 1
with 1
his 1
dear 1
little 1
daughter 1
who 1
soon 1
became 1
stronger 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
beautiful 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
had 1
any 1
brothers 1
for 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
took 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
by 1
chance 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
people 1
about 1
her 1
speak 1
of 1
them 1
yes 1
said 1
they 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
indeed 1
but 1
still 1
tis 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
her 1
brothers 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
lost 1
for 1
her 1
sake 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
grieved 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
any 1
brothers 1
and 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
dared 1
no 1
longer 1
hide 1
the 1
truth 1
from 1
her 1
but 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
birth 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
innocent 1
cause 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
mourned 1
sadly 1
about 1
it 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
thought 1
herself 1
bound 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
she 1
could 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
brothers 1
back 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
neither 1
rest 1
nor 1
ease 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
one 1
day 1
she 1
stole 1
away 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
brothers 1
wherever 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
free 1
them 1
whatever 1
it 1
might 1
cost 1
her 1
she 1
took 1
nothing 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
ring 1
which 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
case 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
hungry 1
a 1
little 1
pitcher 1
of 1
water 1
in 1
case 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
thirsty 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
stool 1
to 1
rest 1
upon 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
weary 1
thus 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
and 1
journeyed 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
worlds 1
end 1
then 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
but 1
the 1
sun 1
looked 1
much 1
too 1
hot 1
and 1
fiery 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
away 1
quickly 1
to 1
the 1
moon 1
but 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
chilly 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
smell 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
this 1
way 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
herself 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
were 1
friendly 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
each 1
star 1
sat 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
little 1
stool 1
but 1
the 1
morning 1
star 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
this 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
you 1
cannot 1
unlock 1
the 1
castle 1
that 1
stands 1
on 1
the 1
glassmountain 1
and 1
there 1
your 1
brothers 1
live 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
took 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
rolled 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
cloth 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
again 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
glassmountain 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
then 1
she 1
felt 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
unwrapped 1
the 1
cloth 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
stars 1
what 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
the 1
glassmountain 1
so 1
this 1
faithful 1
little 1
sister 1
took 1
a 1
knife 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
little 1
finger 1
that 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
seeking 1
for 1
i 1
seek 1
for 1
my 1
brothers 1
the 1
seven 1
ravens 1
answered 1
she 1
then 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
my 1
masters 1
are 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
wait 1
till 1
they 1
come 1
pray 1
step 1
in 1
now 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
was 1
getting 1
their 1
dinner 1
ready 1
and 1
he 1
brought 1
their 1
food 1
upon 1
seven 1
little 1
plates 1
and 1
their 1
drink 1
in 1
seven 1
little 1
glasses 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
little 1
plate 1
their 1
sister 1
ate 1
a 1
small 1
piece 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
little 1
glass 1
she 1
drank 1
a 1
small 1
drop 1
but 1
she 1
let 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
last 1
glass 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
fluttering 1
and 1
croaking 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
here 1
come 1
my 1
masters 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
in 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
their 1
little 1
plates 1
and 1
glasses 1
then 1
said 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
who 1
has 1
eaten 1
from 1
my 1
little 1
plate 1
and 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
glass 1
caw 1
caw 1
well 1
i 1
ween 1
mortal 1
lips 1
have 1
this 1
way 1
been 1
when 1
the 1
seventh 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
glass 1
and 1
found 1
there 1
the 1
ring 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
fathers 1
and 1
mothers 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
that 1
our 1
little 1
sister 1
would 1
but 1
come 1
then 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
heard 1
this 1
for 1
she 1
stood 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
listened 1
she 1
ran 1
forward 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
all 1
the 1
ravens 1
took 1
their 1
right 1
form 1
again 1
and 1
all 1
hugged 1
and 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
went 1
merrily 1
home 1

that 1
his 1
wife 1

to 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1

her 1

stretched 1
himself 1
out 1

has 1
a 1
little 1
pointed 1
mouth 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
he 1
has 1
then 1
let 1
him 1
come 1
upstairs 1
said 1
mrs 1
fox 1
and 1
ordered 1
the 1
servant 1
to 1
prepare 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
sweep 1
me 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
clean 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
window 1
fling 1
out 1
my 1
old 1
man 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
fine 1
fat 1
mouse 1
he 1
brought 1
yet 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
he 1
never 1
thought 1
but 1
ate 1
up 1
every 1
one 1
he 1
caught 1
then 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
solemnized 1
with 1
young 1
mr 1
fox 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
much 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
dancing 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
left 1
off 1
they 1
are 1
dancing 1
still 1
the 1
salad 1
as 1
a 1
merry 1
young 1
huntsman 1
was 1
once 1
going 1
briskly 1
along 1
through 1
a 1
wood 1
there 1
came 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
good 1
day 1
good 1
day 1
you 1
seem 1
merry 1
enough 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
do 1
pray 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
huntsman 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
her 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
then 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
his 1
way 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
listen 1
my 1
friend 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
go 1
your 1
way 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
where 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
nine 1
birds 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
cloak 1
shoot 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
one 1
will 1
fall 1
down 1
dead 1
the 1
cloak 1
will 1
fall 1
too 1
take 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
wishingcloak 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
wear 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
yourself 1
at 1
any 1
place 1
where 1
you 1
may 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
dead 1
bird 1
take 1
out 1
its 1
heart 1
and 1
keep 1
it 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
under 1
your 1
pillow 1
every 1
morning 1
when 1
you 1
rise 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
birds 1
heart 1
that 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
this 1
good 1
luck 1
the 1
huntsman 1
thanked 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
all 1
this 1
does 1
happen 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
hundred 1
steps 1
or 1
so 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
screaming 1
and 1
chirping 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
birds 1
pulling 1
a 1
cloak 1
with 1
their 1
bills 1
and 1
feet 1
screaming 1
fighting 1
and 1
tugging 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
if 1
each 1
wished 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
himself 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
this 1
is 1
wonderful 1
this 1
happens 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
then 1
he 1
shot 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
their 1
feathers 1
flew 1
all 1
about 1
off 1
went 1
the 1
flock 1
chattering 1
away 1
but 1
one 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
cloak 1
with 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
did 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
told 1
him 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
bird 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
heart 1
and 1
carried 1
the 1
cloak 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
his 1
pillow 1
and 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
glittering 1
underneath 1
the 1
same 1
happened 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
indeed 1
every 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
arose 1
he 1
heaped 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
is 1
this 1
gold 1
to 1
me 1
whilst 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
hung 1
his 1
bag 1
and 1
bow 1
about 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
his 1
road 1
one 1
day 1
led 1
through 1
a 1
thick 1
wood 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
castle 1
in 1
a 1
green 1
meadow 1
and 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
stood 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
looking 1
about 1
them 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
a 1
witch 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
coming 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
who 1
carries 1
a 1
wonderful 1
prize 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
child 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
fit 1
for 1
us 1
than 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
birds 1
heart 1
that 1
brings 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
under 1
his 1
pillow 1
every 1
morning 1
meantime 1
the 1
huntsman 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
lady 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
travelling 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
this 1
castle 1
and 1
rest 1
myself 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
money 1
enough 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
anything 1
i 1
want 1
but 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lady 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
was 1
welcomed 1
kindly 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
nothing 1
else 1
but 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
ladys 1
eyes 1
and 1
doing 1
everything 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
getting 1
the 1
birds 1
heart 1
so 1
the 1
lady 1
stole 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
found 1
any 1
more 1
gold 1
under 1
his 1
pillow 1
for 1
it 1
lay 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
young 1
ladys 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
every 1
morning 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
missed 1
his 1
prize 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
birds 1
heart 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
wishingcloak 1
yet 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
must 1
also 1
get 1
let 1
us 1
leave 1
him 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
lost 1
his 1
wealth 1
then 1
the 1
witch 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
such 1
a 1
cloak 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
rare 1
and 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
and 1
will 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
she 1
did 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
told 1
her 1
and 1
set 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
seemed 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
said 1
what 1
makes 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
alas 1
dear 1
sir 1
said 1
she 1
yonder 1
lies 1
the 1
granite 1
rock 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
costly 1
diamonds 1
grow 1
and 1
i 1
want 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
go 1
there 1
that 1
whenever 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
being 1
sorrowful 1
for 1
who 1
can 1
reach 1
it 1
only 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
the 1
fliesman 1
cannot 1
if 1
thats 1
all 1
your 1
grief 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
ill 1
take 1
you 1
there 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
so 1
he 1
drew 1
her 1
under 1
his 1
cloak 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
granite 1
mountain 1
they 1
were 1
both 1
there 1
the 1
diamonds 1
glittered 1
so 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
delighted 1
with 1
the 1
sight 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
finest 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
made 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
ourselves 1
a 1
little 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
stand 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
he 1
laid 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
sleeping 1
on 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
cloak 1
from 1
his 1
shoulders 1
hung 1
it 1
on 1
her 1
own 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
diamonds 1
and 1
wished 1
herself 1
home 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
his 1
lady 1
had 1
tricked 1
him 1
and 1
left 1
him 1
alone 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
rock 1
he 1
said 1
alas 1
what 1
roguery 1
there 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
fear 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
this 1
rock 1
belonged 1
to 1
fierce 1
giants 1
who 1
lived 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
striding 1
about 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
save 1
myself 1
by 1
feigning 1
to 1
be 1
asleep 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
sound 1
sleep 1
when 1
the 1
giants 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
first 1
pushed 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
worm 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
lies 1
here 1
curled 1
up 1
tread 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
second 1
its 1
not 1
worth 1
the 1
trouble 1
said 1
the 1
third 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
hell 1
go 1
climbing 1
higher 1
up 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
some 1
cloud 1
will 1
come 1
rolling 1
and 1
carry 1
him 1
away 1
and 1
they 1
passed 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
huntsman 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
they 1
said 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
gone 1
he 1
climbed 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
there 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
a 1
cloud 1
came 1
rolling 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
caught 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
whirlwind 1
and 1
bore 1
him 1
along 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
till 1
it 1
settled 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
quite 1
gently 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
amongst 1
the 1
greens 1
and 1
cabbages 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
if 1
not 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
worse 1
off 1
than 1
before 1
for 1
here 1
i 1
see 1
neither 1
apples 1
nor 1
pears 1
nor 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
fruits 1
nothing 1
but 1
vegetables 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
can 1
eat 1
salad 1
it 1
will 1
refresh 1
and 1
strengthen 1
me 1
so 1
he 1
picked 1
out 1
a 1
fine 1
head 1
and 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
swallowed 1
two 1
bites 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
himself 1
quite 1
changed 1
and 1
saw 1
with 1
horror 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
an 1
ass 1
however 1
he 1
still 1
felt 1
very 1
hungry 1
and 1
the 1
salad 1
tasted 1
very 1
nice 1
so 1
he 1
ate 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
another 1
kind 1
of 1
salad 1
and 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
tasted 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
another 1
change 1
come 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
soon 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
found 1
his 1
old 1
shape 1
again 1
then 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
slept 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
weariness 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
head 1
both 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
salad 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
this 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
fortune 1
again 1
and 1
enable 1
me 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
some 1
folks 1
for 1
their 1
treachery 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
find 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
after 1
wandering 1
about 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
luckily 1
found 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
stained 1
his 1
face 1
all 1
over 1
brown 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
known 1
him 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
lodging 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
tired 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
countryman 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
business 1
i 1
am 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
messenger 1
sent 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
finest 1
salad 1
that 1
grows 1
under 1
the 1
sun 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
brought 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
scorches 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
begins 1
to 1
wither 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
carry 1
it 1
farther 1
when 1
the 1
witch 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
heard 1
of 1
his 1
beautiful 1
salad 1
they 1
longed 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
countryman 1
let 1
us 1
just 1
taste 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
answered 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
two 1
heads 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
one 1
so 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
bag 1
and 1
gave 1
them 1
the 1
bad 1
then 1
the 1
witch 1
herself 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
be 1
dressed 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
wait 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
carried 1
up 1
but 1
took 1
a 1
few 1
leaves 1
immediately 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
scarcely 1
were 1
they 1
swallowed 1
when 1
she 1
lost 1
her 1
own 1
form 1
and 1
ran 1
braying 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
an 1
ass 1
now 1
the 1
servantmaid 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
salad 1
ready 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
up 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
too 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
ate 1
some 1
leaves 1
so 1
she 1
also 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
an 1
ass 1
and 1
ran 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
letting 1
the 1
dish 1
with 1
the 1
salad 1
fall 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
the 1
messenger 1
sat 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
with 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
as 1
nobody 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
salad 1
and 1
she 1
longed 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
salad 1
can 1
be 1
then 1
he 1
thought 1
something 1
must 1
have 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
see 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
asses 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
running 1
about 1
and 1
the 1
salad 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
those 1
two 1
have 1
had 1
their 1
share 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
saying 1
i 1
bring 1
you 1
the 1
dish 1
myself 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
she 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
others 1
ran 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
braying 1
away 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
washed 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
know 1
him 1
now 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
paid 1
for 1
your 1
roguery 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
tied 1
them 1
all 1
three 1
to 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
took 1
them 1
along 1
with 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
mill 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
whats 1
the 1
matter 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
i 1

tiresome 1

the 1
other 1
if 1
you 1

take 1
them 1

them 1
food 1
and 1
room 1
and 1

them 1
as 1

you 1
i 1
will 1
pay 1

whatever 1

all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
but 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
treat 1
them 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
said 1
give 1
the 1
old 1

three 1
times 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
hay 1
once 1

could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
beaten 1
after 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
he 1
found 1
everything 1
he 1
wanted 1
some 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
miller 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
ass 1
was 1
dead 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
said 1
he 1
are 1
alive 1
and 1
eat 1
but 1
are 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
last 1
long 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
pitied 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
miller 1
to 1
drive 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
he 1
gave 1
them 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
salad 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
knees 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
o 1
dearest 1
huntsman 1
forgive 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
ill 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
my 1
mother 1
forced 1
me 1
to 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
against 1
my 1
will 1
for 1
i 1
always 1
loved 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
your 1
wishingcloak 1
hangs 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
birds 1
heart 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
too 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
keep 1
it 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
for 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
my 1
wife 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
lived 1
together 1
very 1
happily 1
till 1
they 1
died 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
youth 1
who 1
went 1
forth 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
fear 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
father 1
had 1
two 1
sons 1
the 1
elder 1
of 1
who 1
was 1
smart 1
and 1
sensible 1
and 1
could 1
do 1
everything 1
but 1
the 1
younger 1
was 1
stupid 1
and 1
could 1
neither 1
learn 1
nor 1
understand 1
anything 1
and 1
when 1
people 1
saw 1
him 1
they 1
said 1
theres 1
a 1
fellow 1
who 1
will 1
give 1
his 1
father 1
some 1
trouble 1
when 1
anything 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
elder 1
who 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
but 1
if 1
his 1
father 1
bade 1
him 1
fetch 1
anything 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
nighttime 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
led 1
through 1
the 1
churchyard 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
dismal 1
place 1
he 1
answered 1
oh 1
no 1
father 1
ill 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
or 1
when 1
stories 1
were 1
told 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
at 1
night 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
flesh 1
creep 1
the 1
listeners 1
sometimes 1
said 1
oh 1
it 1
makes 1
us 1
shudder 1
the 1
younger 1
sat 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
listened 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
they 1
could 1
mean 1
they 1
are 1
always 1
saying 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
make 1
me 1
shudder 1
thought 1
he 1
that 1
too 1
must 1
be 1
an 1
art 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
understand 1
nothing 1
now 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
one 1
day 1
hearken 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
there 1
you 1
are 1
growing 1
tall 1
and 1
strong 1
and 1
you 1
too 1
must 1
learn 1
something 1
by 1
which 1
you 1
can 1
earn 1
your 1
bread 1
look 1
how 1
your 1
brother 1
works 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
even 1
earn 1
your 1
salt 1
well 1
father 1
he 1
replied 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
learn 1
somethingindeed 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
but 1
be 1
managed 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
i 1
dont 1
understand 1
that 1
at 1
all 1
yet 1
the 1
elder 1
brother 1
smiled 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
goodness 1
what 1
a 1
blockhead 1
that 1
brother 1
of 1
mine 1
is 1
he 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
good 1
for 1
anything 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
lives 1
he 1
who 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
sickle 1
must 1
bend 1
himself 1
betimes 1
the 1
father 1
sighed 1
and 1
answered 1
him 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
earn 1
your 1
bread 1
by 1
that 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
sexton 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
bewailed 1
his 1
trouble 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
his 1
younger 1
son 1
was 1
so 1
backward 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
and 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
just 1
think 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
earn 1
his 1
bread 1
he 1
actually 1
wanted 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
shudder 1
if 1
that 1
be 1
all 1
replied 1
the 1
sexton 1
he 1
can 1
learn 1
that 1
with 1
me 1
send 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
polish 1
him 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
will 1
train 1
the 1
boy 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
sexton 1
therefore 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
ring 1
the 1
church 1
bell 1
after 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
sexton 1
awoke 1
him 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
arise 1
and 1
go 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
tower 1
and 1
ring 1
the 1
bell 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
shuddering 1
is 1
thought 1
he 1
and 1
secretly 1
went 1
there 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
white 1
figure 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
opposite 1
the 1
sounding 1
hole 1
who 1
is 1
there 1
cried 1
he 1
but 1
the 1
figure 1
made 1
no 1
reply 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
or 1
stir 1
give 1
an 1
answer 1
cried 1
the 1
boy 1
or 1
take 1
yourself 1
off 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
business 1
here 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
sexton 1
however 1
remained 1
standing 1
motionless 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
might 1
think 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
ghost 1
the 1
boy 1
cried 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
herespeak 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
honest 1
fellow 1
or 1
i 1
will 1
throw 1
you 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
the 1
sexton 1
thought 1
he 1
cant 1
mean 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
his 1
words 1
uttered 1
no 1
sound 1
and 1
stood 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
stone 1
then 1
the 1
boy 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
and 1
as 1
that 1
was 1
also 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
he 1
ran 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
pushed 1
the 1
ghost 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
the 1
ten 1
steps 1
and 1
remained 1
lying 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
thereupon 1
he 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
the 1
sextons 1
wife 1
waited 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
became 1
uneasy 1
and 1
wakened 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
asked 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
my 1
husband 1
is 1
he 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tower 1
before 1
you 1
did 1
no 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
replied 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
someone 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
sounding 1
hole 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
neither 1
gave 1
an 1
answer 1
nor 1
go 1
away 1
i 1
took 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
scoundrel 1
and 1
threw 1
him 1
downstairs 1
just 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
woman 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
found 1
her 1
husband 1
who 1
was 1
lying 1
moaning 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
had 1
broken 1
his 1
leg 1
she 1
carried 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
loud 1
screams 1
she 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
boys 1
father 1
your 1
boy 1
cried 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
misfortune 1
he 1
has 1
thrown 1
my 1
husband 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
broke 1
his 1
leg 1
take 1
the 1
goodfornothing 1
fellow 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
house 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
scolded 1
the 1
boy 1
what 1
wicked 1
tricks 1
are 1
these 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
devil 1
must 1
have 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
your 1
head 1
father 1
he 1
replied 1
do 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
innocent 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
there 1
by 1
night 1
like 1
one 1
intent 1
on 1
doing 1
evil 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
i 1
entreated 1
him 1
three 1
times 1
either 1
to 1
speak 1
or 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
father 1

but 1
unhappiness 1

father 1
right 1
willingly 1
wait 1
only 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
day 1
then 1
will 1
i 1
go 1
forth 1
and 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
understand 1
one 1
art 1
which 1
will 1
support 1
me 1
learn 1
what 1
you 1
will 1
spoke 1
the 1
father 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
to 1
me 1
here 1
are 1
fifty 1
talers 1
for 1
you 1
take 1
these 1
and 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
tell 1
no 1
one 1
from 1
whence 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
you 1
yes 1
father 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
if 1
you 1
desire 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
easily 1
keep 1
it 1
in 1
mind 1
when 1
the 1
day 1
dawned 1
therefore 1
the 1
boy 1
put 1
his 1
fifty 1
talers 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
went 1
forth 1
on 1
the 1
great 1
highway 1
and 1
continually 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
then 1
a 1
man 1
approached 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
conversation 1
which 1
the 1
youth 1
was 1
holding 1
with 1
himself 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
gallows 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
look 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
seven 1
men 1
have 1
married 1
the 1
ropemakers 1
daughter 1
and 1
are 1
now 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
fly 1
sit 1
down 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
wait 1
till 1
night 1
comes 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
wanted 1
answered 1
the 1
youth 1
it 1
is 1
easily 1
done 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
my 1
fifty 1
talers 1
just 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
sat 1
down 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
waited 1
till 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
cold 1
he 1
lighted 1
himself 1
a 1
fire 1
but 1
at 1
midnight 1
the 1
wind 1
blew 1
so 1
sharply 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
his 1
fire 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
warm 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
knocked 1
the 1
hanged 1
men 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
they 1
moved 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
you 1
shiver 1
below 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
how 1
those 1
up 1
above 1
must 1
freeze 1
and 1
suffer 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
pity 1
for 1
them 1
he 1
raised 1
the 1
ladder 1
and 1
climbed 1
up 1
unbound 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
brought 1
down 1
all 1
seven 1
then 1
he 1
stoked 1
the 1
fire 1
blew 1
it 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
all 1
round 1
it 1
to 1
warm 1
themselves 1
but 1
they 1
sat 1
there 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
caught 1
their 1
clothes 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
take 1
care 1
or 1
i 1
will 1
hang 1
you 1
up 1
again 1
the 1
dead 1
men 1
however 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
but 1
were 1
quite 1
silent 1
and 1
let 1
their 1
rags 1
go 1
on 1
burning 1
at 1
this 1
he 1
grew 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
care 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
burnt 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
hung 1
them 1
up 1
again 1
each 1
in 1
his 1
turn 1
then 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
man 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
fifty 1
talers 1
and 1
said 1
well 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
no 1
answered 1
he 1
how 1
should 1
i 1
know 1
those 1
fellows 1
up 1
there 1
did 1
not 1
open 1
their 1
mouths 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
stupid 1
that 1
they 1
let 1
the 1
few 1
old 1
rags 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
on 1
their 1
bodies 1
get 1
burnt 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
get 1
the 1
fifty 1
talers 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
saying 1
such 1
a 1
youth 1
has 1
never 1
come 1
my 1
way 1
before 1
the 1
youth 1
likewise 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
began 1
to 1
mutter 1
to 1
himself 1
ah 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
ah 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
a 1
waggoner 1
who 1
was 1
striding 1
behind 1
him 1
heard 1
this 1
and 1
asked 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
answered 1
the 1
youth 1
then 1
the 1
waggoner 1
asked 1
from 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
muttering 1
between 1
your 1
teeth 1
ah 1
replied 1
the 1
youth 1
i 1
do 1
so 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
shudder 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
teach 1
me 1
how 1
enough 1
of 1
your 1
foolish 1
chatter 1
said 1
the 1
waggoner 1
come 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
see 1
about 1
a 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
waggoner 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
an 1
inn 1
where 1
they 1
wished 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
parlour 1
the 1
youth 1
again 1
said 1
quite 1
loudly 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
the 1
host 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
your 1
desire 1
there 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
opportunity 1
for 1
you 1
here 1
ah 1
be 1
silent 1
said 1
the 1
hostess 1
so 1
many 1
prying 1
persons 1
have 1
already 1
lost 1
their 1
lives 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pity 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
if 1
such 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
as 1
these 1
should 1
never 1
see 1
the 1
daylight 1
again 1
but 1
the 1
youth 1
said 1
however 1
difficult 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
i 1
will 1
learn 1
it 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
indeed 1
have 1
i 1
journeyed 1
forth 1
he 1
let 1
the 1
host 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
until 1
the 1
latter 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
thence 1
stood 1
a 1
haunted 1
castle 1
where 1
anyone 1
could 1
very 1
easily 1
learn 1
what 1
shuddering 1
was 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
but 1
watch 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
three 1
nights 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
promised 1
that 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
venture 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
likewise 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
lay 1
great 1
treasures 1
which 1
were 1
guarded 1
by 1
evil 1
spirits 1
and 1
these 1
treasures 1
would 1
then 1
be 1
freed 1
and 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
rich 1
enough 1
already 1
many 1
men 1
had 1
gone 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
as 1
yet 1
none 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
again 1
then 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
next 1
morning 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
allowed 1
i 1
will 1
willingly 1
watch 1
three 1
nights 1
in 1
the 1
haunted 1
castle 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
youth 1
pleased 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
may 1
ask 1
for 1
three 1
things 1
to 1
take 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
things 1
without 1
life 1
then 1
he 1
answered 1
then 1
i 1
ask 1
for 1
a 1
fire 1
a 1
turning 1
lathe 1
and 1
a 1
cuttingboard 1
with 1
the 1
knife 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
these 1
things 1
carried 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
for 1
him 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
night 1
was 1
drawing 1
near 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
himself 1
a 1
bright 1
fire 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rooms 1
placed 1
the 1
cuttingboard 1
and 1
knife 1
beside 1
it 1
and 1
seated 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
turninglathe 1
ah 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
learn 1
it 1
here 1
either 1
towards 1
midnight 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
poke 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
blowing 1
it 1
something 1
cried 1
suddenly 1
from 1
one 1
corner 1
au 1
miau 1
how 1
cold 1
we 1
are 1
you 1
fools 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
crying 1
about 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
cold 1
come 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
warm 1
yourselves 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
two 1
great 1
black 1
cats 1
came 1
with 1
one 1
tremendous 1
leap 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
savagely 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
their 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
after 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
warmed 1
themselves 1
they 1
said 1
comrade 1
shall 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
game 1
of 1
cards 1
why 1
not 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
just 1
show 1
me 1
your 1
paws 1
then 1
they 1
stretched 1
out 1
their 1
claws 1
oh 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
long 1
nails 1
you 1
have 1
wait 1
i 1
must 1
first 1
cut 1
them 1
for 1
you 1
thereupon 1
he 1
seized 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
throats 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
cuttingboard 1
and 1
screwed 1
their 1
feet 1
fast 1
i 1
have 1
looked 1
at 1
your 1
fingers 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
my 1
fancy 1
for 1
cardplaying 1
has 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
struck 1
them 1
dead 1
and 1
threw 1
them 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
away 1
with 1
these 1
two 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
again 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
out 1
from 1
every 1
hole 1
and 1
corner 1
came 1
black 1
cats 1
and 1
black 1
dogs 1
with 1
redhot 1
chains 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
of 1
them 1
came 1
until 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
move 1
and 1
they 1
yelled 1
horribly 1
and 1
got 1
on 1
his 1
fire 1
pulled 1
it 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
he 1
watched 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
quietly 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
too 1
far 1
he 1
seized 1
his 1
cuttingknife 1
and 1
cried 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
vermin 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
cut 1
them 1
down 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
ran 1
away 1
the 1
others 1
he 1
killed 1
and 1
threw 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
fishpond 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
fanned 1
the 1
embers 1
of 1
his 1
fire 1
again 1
and 1
warmed 1
himself 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
thus 1
sat 1
his 1
eyes 1
would 1
keep 1
open 1
no 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
sleep 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
great 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
however 1
the 1
bed 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
thats 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
go 1
faster 1
then 1
the 1
bed 1
rolled 1
on 1
as 1
if 1
six 1
horses 1
were 1
harnessed 1
to 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
over 1
thresholds 1
and 1
stairs 1
but 1
suddenly 1
hop 1
hop 1
it 1
turned 1
over 1
upside 1
down 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
but 1
he 1
threw 1
quilts 1
and 1
pillows 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
got 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
anyone 1
who 1
likes 1
may 1
drive 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
slept 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
him 1
lying 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
he 1
thought 1
the 1
evil 1
spirits 1
had 1
killed 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pityfor 1
so 1
handsome 1
a 1
man 1
the 1
youth 1
heard 1
it 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
yet 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
astonished 1
but 1
very 1
glad 1
and 1
asked 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
fared 1
very 1
well 1
indeed 1
answered 1
he 1
one 1
night 1
is 1
past 1
the 1
two 1
others 1
will 1
pass 1
likewise 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
innkeeper 1
who 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
very 1
wide 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
never 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
alive 1
again 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
yet 1
no 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
if 1
someone 1
would 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
second 1
night 1
he 1
again 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
old 1
castle 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
began 1
his 1
old 1
song 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
when 1
midnight 1
came 1
an 1
uproar 1
and 1
noise 1
of 1
tumbling 1
about 1
was 1
heard 1
at 1
first 1
it 1
was 1
low 1
but 1
it 1
grew 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
quiet 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
with 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
half 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
down 1
the 1
chimney 1
and 1
fell 1
before 1
him 1
hullo 1
cried 1
he 1
another 1
half 1
belongs 1
to 1
this 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
enough 1
then 1
the 1
uproar 1
began 1
again 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
roaring 1
and 1
howling 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
half 1
fell 1
down 1
likewise 1
wait 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
just 1
stoke 1
up 1
the 1
fire 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
that 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
again 1
the 1
two 1
pieces 1
were 1
joined 1
together 1
and 1
a 1
hideous 1
man 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
his 1
place 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
bargain 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
the 1
bench 1
is 1
mine 1
the 1
man 1
wanted 1
to 1
push 1
him 1
away 1
the 1
youth 1
however 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
that 1
but 1
thrust 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
and 1
seated 1
himself 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
place 1
then 1
still 1
more 1
men 1
fell 1
down 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
brought 1
nine 1
dead 1
mens 1
legs 1
and 1
two 1
skulls 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
played 1
at 1
ninepins 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
youth 1
also 1
wanted 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
said 1
listen 1
you 1
can 1
i 1
join 1
you 1
yes 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
money 1
money 1
enough 1
replied 1
he 1
but 1
your 1
balls 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
round 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
skulls 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
lathe 1
and 1
turned 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
were 1
round 1
there 1
now 1
they 1
will 1
roll 1
better 1
said 1
he 1
hurrah 1
now 1
well 1
have 1
fun 1
he 1
played 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
lost 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
everything 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
sight 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
quietly 1
fell 1
asleep 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
to 1
inquire 1
after 1
him 1
how 1
has 1
it 1
fared 1
with 1
you 1
this 1
time 1
asked 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
playing 1
at 1
ninepins 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
farthings 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
shuddered 1
then 1
what 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
wonderful 1
time 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
but 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shudder 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
bench 1
and 1
said 1
quite 1
sadly 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
when 1
it 1
grew 1
late 1
six 1
tall 1
men 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
coffin 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
ha 1
ha 1
that 1
is 1
certainly 1
my 1
little 1
cousin 1
who 1
died 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
ago 1
and 1
he 1
beckoned 1
with 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
cried 1
come 1
little 1
cousin 1
come 1
they 1
placed 1
the 1
coffin 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
lid 1
off 1
and 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
lay 1
therein 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
cold 1
as 1
ice 1
wait 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
warm 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
warmed 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
dead 1
mans 1
face 1
but 1
he 1
remained 1
cold 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
laid 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
arms 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
might 1
circulate 1
again 1
as 1
this 1
also 1
did 1
no 1
good 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
when 1
two 1
people 1
lie 1
in 1
bed 1
together 1
they 1
warm 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
covered 1
him 1
over 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
him 1
after 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
became 1
warm 1
too 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
see 1
little 1
cousin 1
have 1
i 1
not 1
warmed 1
you 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
however 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
now 1
will 1
i 1
strangle 1
you 1
what 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
thank 1
me 1
you 1
shall 1
at 1
once 1
go 1
into 1
your 1
coffin 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
threw 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
lid 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
six 1
men 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
away 1
again 1
i 1
cannot 1
manage 1
to 1
shudder 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
learn 1
it 1
here 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
live 1
then 1
a 1
man 1
entered 1
who 1
was 1
taller 1
than 1
all 1
others 1
and 1
looked 1
terrible 1
he 1
was 1
old 1
however 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
beard 1
you 1
wretch 1
cried 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
for 1
you 1
shall 1
die 1
not 1
so 1
fast 1
replied 1
the 1
youth 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
die 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
say 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
seize 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
fiend 1
softly 1
softly 1
do 1
not 1
talk 1
so 1
big 1
i 1
am 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
perhaps 1
even 1
stronger 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
stronger 1
i 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
gocome 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
then 1
he 1
led 1
him 1
by 1
dark 1
passages 1
to 1
a 1
smiths 1
forge 1
took 1
an 1
axe 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
struck 1
an 1
anvil 1
into 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
better 1
than 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
anvil 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
placed 1
himself 1
near 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
and 1
his 1
white 1
beard 1
hung 1
down 1
then 1
the 1
youth 1
seized 1
the 1
axe 1
split 1
the 1
anvil 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
caught 1
the 1
old 1
mans 1
beard 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
turn 1
to 1
die 1
then 1
he 1
seized 1
an 1
iron 1
bar 1
and 1
beat 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
till 1
he 1
moaned 1
and 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
when 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
great 1
riches 1
the 1
youth 1
drew 1
out 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
led 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
cellar 1
showed 1
him 1
three 1
chests 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
of 1
these 1
said 1
he 1
one 1
part 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
the 1
other 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
third 1
yours 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
and 1
the 1
spirit 1
disappeared 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
youth 1
stood 1
in 1
darkness 1
i 1
shall 1
still 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
felt 1
about 1
found 1
the 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
slept 1
there 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
shuddering 1
is 1
no 1
he 1
answered 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
my 1
dead 1
cousin 1
was 1
here 1
and 1
a 1
bearded 1
man 1
came 1
and 1
showed 1
me 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
down 1
below 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shudder 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
shall 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
then 1
the 1
gold 1
was 1
brought 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
celebrated 1
but 1
howsoever 1
much 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
loved 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
however 1
happy 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
still 1
said 1
always 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudderif 1
i 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
and 1
this 1
at 1
last 1
angered 1
her 1
her 1
waitingmaid 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
cure 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
which 1
flowed 1
through 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
bucketful 1
of 1
gudgeons 1
brought 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
was 1
sleeping 1
his 1
wife 1
was 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
clothes 1
off 1
him 1
and 1
empty 1
the 1
bucket 1
full 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
with 1
the 1
gudgeons 1
in 1
it 1
over 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
fishes 1
would 1
sprawl 1
about 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
woke 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
oh 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
sowhat 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
so 1
dear 1
wife 1
ah 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
a 1
great 1
king 1
of 1
a 1
land 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
but 1
so 1
proud 1
and 1
haughty 1
and 1
conceited 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
princes 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
in 1
marriage 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
only 1
made 1
sport 1
of 1
them 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
king 1
held 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
and 1
asked 1
thither 1
all 1
her 1
suitors 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
sat 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
ranged 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
rankkings 1
and 1
princes 1
and 1
dukes 1
and 1
earls 1
and 1
counts 1
and 1
barons 1
and 1
knights 1
then 1
the 1
princess 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
passed 1
by 1
them 1
she 1
had 1
something 1
spiteful 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
the 1
first 1
was 1
too 1
fat 1
hes 1
as 1
round 1
as 1
a 1
tub 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
next 1
was 1
too 1
tall 1
what 1
a 1
maypole 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
next 1
was 1
too 1
short 1
what 1
a 1
dumpling 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
fourth 1
was 1
too 1
pale 1
and 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
wallface 1
the 1
fifth 1
was 1
too 1
red 1
so 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
coxcomb 1
the 1
sixth 1
was 1
not 1
straight 1
enough 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
green 1
stick 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
to 1
dry 1
over 1
a 1
bakers 1
oven 1
and 1
thus 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
joke 1
to 1
crack 1
upon 1
every 1
one 1
but 1
she 1
laughed 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
at 1
a 1
good 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
said 1
she 1
his 1
beard 1
is 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
mop 1
he 1
shall 1
be 1
called 1
grislybeard 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
the 1
nickname 1
of 1
grislybeard 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
how 1
his 1
daughter 1
behaved 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
illtreated 1
all 1
his 1
guests 1
and 1
he 1
vowed 1
that 1
willing 1
or 1
unwilling 1
she 1
should 1
marry 1
the 1
first 1
man 1
be 1
he 1
prince 1
or 1
beggar 1
that 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
a 1
travelling 1
fiddler 1
who 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
beg 1
alms 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
heard 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
let 1
him 1
come 1
in 1
so 1
they 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
dirtylooking 1
fellow 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
sung 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
begged 1
a 1
boon 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
sung 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
daughter 1
for 1
your 1
wife 1
the 1
princess 1
begged 1
and 1
prayed 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
sworn 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
comer 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
my 1
word 1
so 1
words 1
and 1
tears 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
the 1
parson 1
was 1
sent 1
for 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
the 1
fiddler 1
when 1
this 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
now 1
get 1
ready 1
to 1
goyou 1
must 1
not 1
stay 1
hereyou 1
must 1
travel 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
husband 1
then 1
the 1
fiddler 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
wood 1
pray 1
said 1
she 1
whose 1
is 1
this 1
wood 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
answered 1
he 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
all 1
had 1
been 1
thine 1
ah 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
sighed 1
she 1
would 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
married 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
next 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
some 1
fine 1
meadows 1
whose 1
are 1
these 1
beautiful 1
green 1
meadows 1
said 1
she 1
they 1
belong 1
to 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
thine 1
ah 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
married 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
city 1
whose 1
is 1
this 1
noble 1
city 1
said 1
she 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
thine 1
ah 1
wretch 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
sighed 1
she 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
marry 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
mine 1
said 1
the 1
fiddler 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
wish 1
for 1
another 1
husband 1
am 1
not 1
i 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
you 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
cottage 1
what 1
a 1
paltry 1
place 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
whom 1
does 1
that 1
little 1
dirty 1
hole 1
belong 1
then 1
the 1
fiddler 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
your 1
and 1
my 1
house 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
live 1
where 1
are 1
your 1
servants 1
cried 1
she 1
what 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
with 1
servants 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
for 1
yourself 1
whatever 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
now 1
make 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
water 1
and 1
cook 1
my 1
supper 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
tired 1
but 1
the 1
princess 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
making 1
fires 1
and 1
cooking 1
and 1
the 1
fiddler 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
a 1
very 1
scanty 1
meal 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
fiddler 1
called 1
her 1
up 1
very 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
clean 1
the 1
house 1
thus 1
they 1
lived 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
up 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
wife 1
we 1
cant 1
go 1
on 1
thus 1
spending 1
money 1
and 1
earning 1
nothing 1
you 1
must 1
learn 1
to 1
weave 1
baskets 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
cut 1
willows 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
home 1
and 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
weave 1
but 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
fingers 1
very 1
sore 1
i 1
see 1
this 1
work 1
wont 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
try 1
and 1
spin 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
better 1
so 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
spin 1
but 1
the 1
threads 1
cut 1
her 1
tender 1
fingers 1
till 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
see 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fiddler 1
you 1
are 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
no 1
work 1
what 1
a 1
bargain 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
however 1
ill 1
try 1
and 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
trade 1
in 1
pots 1
and 1
pans 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
sell 1
them 1
alas 1
sighed 1
she 1
if 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
fathers 1
court 1
should 1
pass 1
by 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
how 1
they 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
but 1
her 1
husband 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
for 1
that 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
must 1
work 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
trade 1
went 1
well 1
for 1
many 1
people 1
seeing 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
went 1
to 1
buy 1
her 1
wares 1
and 1
paid 1
their 1
money 1
without 1
thinking 1
of 1
taking 1
away 1
the 1
goods 1
they 1
lived 1
on 1
this 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
lasted 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
husband 1
bought 1
a 1
fresh 1
lot 1
of 1
ware 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
but 1
a 1
drunken 1
soldier 1
soon 1
came 1
by 1
and 1
rode 1
his 1
horse 1
against 1
her 1
stall 1
and 1
broke 1
all 1
her 1
goods 1
into 1
a 1
thousand 1
pieces 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
ah 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
will 1
my 1
husband 1
say 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
silly 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
earthenware 1
stall 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
where 1
everybody 1
passes 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
crying 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
work 1
so 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
palace 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
a 1
kitchenmaid 1
and 1
they 1
say 1
they 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
thus 1
the 1
princess 1
became 1
a 1
kitchenmaid 1
and 1
helped 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
dirtiest 1
work 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
carry 1
home 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
meat 1
that 1
was 1
left 1
and 1
on 1
this 1
they 1
lived 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
kings 1
eldest 1
son 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
pomp 1
and 1
brightness 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
was 1
there 1
then 1
she 1
bitterly 1
grieved 1
for 1
the 1
pride 1
and 1
folly 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
so 1
low 1
and 1
the 1
servants 1
gave 1
her 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
meats 1
which 1
she 1
put 1
into 1
her 1
basket 1
to 1
take 1
home 1
all 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
in 1
came 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
in 1
golden 1
clothes 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
his 1
partner 1
in 1
the 1
dance 1
but 1
she 1
trembled 1
for 1
fear 1
for 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
who 1
was 1
making 1
sport 1
of 1
her 1
however 1
he 1
kept 1
fast 1
hold 1
and 1
led 1
her 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
basket 1
came 1
off 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
meats 1
in 1
it 1
fell 1
about 1
then 1
everybody 1
laughed 1
and 1
jeered 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
abashed 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
herself 1
a 1
thousand 1
feet 1
deep 1
in 1
the 1
earth 1
she 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
king 1
grislybeard 1
overtook 1
her 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
fear 1
me 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
fiddler 1
who 1
has 1
lived 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
i 1
brought 1
you 1
there 1
because 1
i 1
really 1
loved 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
also 1
the 1
soldier 1
that 1
overset 1
your 1
stall 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
all 1
this 1
only 1
to 1
cure 1
you 1
of 1
your 1
silly 1
pride 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
your 1
illtreatment 1
of 1
me 1
now 1
all 1
is 1
over 1
you 1
have 1
learnt 1
wisdom 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
to 1
hold 1
our 1
marriage 1
feast 1
then 1
the 1
chamberlains 1
came 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
robes 1
and 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
whole 1
court 1
were 1
there 1
already 1
and 1
welcomed 1
her 1
home 1
on 1
her 1
marriage 1
joy 1
was 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
and 1
every 1
heart 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
grand 1
they 1
danced 1
and 1
sang 1
all 1
were 1
merry 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
iron 1
hans 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
forest 1
near 1
his 1
palace 1
full 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
wild 1
animals 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
out 1
a 1
huntsman 1
to 1
shoot 1
him 1
a 1
roe 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
perhaps 1
some 1
accident 1
has 1
befallen 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
out 1
two 1
more 1
huntsmen 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
too 1
stayed 1
away 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
said 1
scour 1
the 1
whole 1
forest 1
through 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
give 1
up 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
found 1
all 1
three 1
but 1
of 1
these 1
also 1
none 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
none 1
were 1
seen 1
again 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
forth 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
any 1
longer 1
venture 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
it 1
lay 1
there 1
in 1
deep 1
stillness 1
and 1
solitude 1
and 1
nothing 1
was 1
seen 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
sometimes 1
an 1
eagle 1
or 1
a 1
hawk 1
flying 1
over 1
it 1
this 1
lasted 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
when 1
an 1
unknown 1
huntsman 1
announced 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
as 1
seeking 1
a 1
situation 1
and 1
offered 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
dangerous 1
forest 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
his 1
consent 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
safe 1
in 1
there 1
i 1
fear 1
it 1
would 1
fare 1
with 1
you 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
with 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
come 1
out 1
again 1
the 1
huntsman 1
replied 1
lord 1
i 1
will 1
venture 1
it 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
risk 1
of 1
fear 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
the 1
huntsman 1
therefore 1
betook 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
dog 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
dog 1
fell 1
in 1
with 1
some 1
game 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
pursue 1
it 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
the 1
dog 1
run 1
two 1
steps 1
when 1
it 1
stood 1
before 1
a 1
deep 1
pool 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
and 1
a 1
naked 1
arm 1
stretched 1
itself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
seized 1
it 1
and 1
drew 1
it 1
under 1
when 1
the 1
huntsman 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
fetched 1
three 1
men 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
buckets 1
and 1
bale 1
out 1
the 1
water 1
when 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
there 1
lay 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
whose 1
body 1
was 1
brown 1
like 1
rusty 1
iron 1
and 1
whose 1
hair 1
hung 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
they 1
bound 1
him 1
with 1
cords 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
astonishment 1
over 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
had 1
him 1
put 1
in 1
an 1
iron 1
cage 1
in 1
his 1
courtyard 1
and 1
forbade 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
be 1
opened 1
on 1
pain 1
of 1
death 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
key 1
into 1
her 1
keeping 1
and 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
forth 1
everyone 1
could 1
again 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
safety 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
of 1
eight 1
years 1
who 1
was 1
once 1
playing 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
his 1
golden 1
ball 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
cage 1
the 1
boy 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
said 1
give 1
me 1
my 1
ball 1
out 1
not 1
till 1
you 1
have 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
me 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
boy 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
has 1
forbidden 1
it 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
again 1
went 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
ball 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
said 1
open 1
my 1
door 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
would 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
ridden 1
out 1
hunting 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
went 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
cannot 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
wished 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
key 1
then 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
said 1
it 1
lies 1
under 1
your 1
mothers 1
pillow 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
there 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
ball 1
back 1
cast 1
all 1
thought 1
to 1
the 1
winds 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
key 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
with 1
difficulty 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
pinched 1
his 1
fingers 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
open 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
stepped 1
out 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
golden 1
ball 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
the 1
boy 1
had 1
become 1
afraid 1
he 1
called 1
and 1
cried 1
after 1
him 1
oh 1
wild 1
man 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
away 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
beaten 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
turned 1
back 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
set 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
hasty 1
steps 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
home 1
he 1
observed 1
the 1
empty 1
cage 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
queen 1
how 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
she 1
knew 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
sought 1
the 1
key 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
called 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
answered 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
out 1
people 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
could 1
easily 1
guess 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
much 1
grief 1
reigned 1
in 1
the 1
royal 1
court 1
when 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
had 1
once 1
more 1
reached 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
boy 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
again 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
you 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
compassion 1
on 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
all 1
i 1
bid 1
you 1
you 1
shall 1
fare 1
well 1
of 1
treasure 1
and 1
gold 1
have 1
i 1
enough 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
anyone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
moss 1
for 1
the 1
boy 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
slept 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
man 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
well 1
and 1
said 1
behold 1
the 1
gold 1
well 1
is 1
as 1
bright 1
and 1
clear 1
as 1
crystal 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
beside 1
it 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
nothing 1
falls 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
polluted 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
every 1
evening 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
obeyed 1
my 1
order 1
the 1
boy 1
placed 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
often 1
saw 1
a 1
golden 1
fish 1
or 1
a 1
golden 1
snake 1
show 1
itself 1
therein 1
and 1
took 1
care 1
that 1
nothing 1
fell 1
in 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
sitting 1
his 1
finger 1
hurt 1
him 1
so 1
violently 1
that 1
he 1
involuntarily 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
quickly 1
out 1
again 1
but 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
gilded 1
and 1
whatsoever 1
pains 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
wash 1
the 1
gold 1
off 1
again 1
all 1
was 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
iron 1
hans 1
came 1
back 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
nothing 1
nothing 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
finger 1
behind 1
his 1
back 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
might 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
dipped 1
your 1
finger 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
this 1
time 1
it 1
may 1
pass 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
again 1
let 1
anything 1
go 1
in 1
by 1
daybreak 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
already 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
watching 1
it 1
his 1
finger 1
hurt 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
passed 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
unhappily 1
a 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
quickly 1
out 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
quite 1
gilded 1
iron 1
hans 1
came 1
and 1
already 1
knew 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
you 1
have 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
watch 1
by 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
but 1
if 1
this 1
happens 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
then 1
the 1
well 1
is 1
polluted 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
remain 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
the 1
boy 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
his 1
finger 1
however 1
much 1
it 1
hurt 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
long 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
still 1
bent 1
down 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
so 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
look 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
eyes 1
his 1
long 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
shoulders 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
he 1
raised 1
himself 1
up 1
quickly 1
but 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
hair 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
was 1
already 1
golden 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
terrified 1
the 1
poor 1
boy 1
was 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
pockethandkerchief 1
and 1
tied 1
it 1
round 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
might 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
he 1
already 1
knew 1
everything 1
and 1
said 1
take 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
off 1
then 1
the 1
golden 1
hair 1
streamed 1
forth 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
boy 1
excuse 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
stood 1
the 1
trial 1
and 1
can 1
stay 1
here 1
no 1
longer 1
go 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
learn 1
what 1
poverty 1
is 1
but 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
heart 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
mean 1
well 1
by 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
i 1
will 1
grant 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
fall 1
into 1
any 1
difficulty 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
cry 1
iron 1
hans 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
help 1
you 1
my 1
power 1
is 1
great 1
greater 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
in 1
abundance 1
then 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
left 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
walked 1
by 1
beaten 1
and 1
unbeaten 1
paths 1
ever 1
onwards 1
until 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
reached 1
a 1
great 1
city 1
there 1
he 1
looked 1
for 1
work 1
but 1
could 1
find 1
none 1
and 1
he 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
himself 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
people 1
about 1
court 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
know 1
what 1
use 1
they 1
could 1
make 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
liked 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
cook 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
might 1
carry 1
wood 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
rake 1
the 1
cinders 1
together 1
once 1
when 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
at 1
hand 1
the 1
cook 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
carry 1
the 1
food 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
let 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
be 1
seen 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
come 1
under 1
the 1
kings 1
notice 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
you 1
must 1
take 1
your 1
hat 1
off 1
he 1
answered 1
ah 1
lord 1
i 1
cannot 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
bad 1
sore 1
place 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
cook 1
called 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
scolded 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
such 1
a 1
boy 1
as 1
that 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
cook 1
however 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
exchanged 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
gardeners 1
boy 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
boy 1
had 1
to 1
plant 1
and 1
water 1
the 1
garden 1
hoe 1
and 1
dig 1
and 1
bear 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
bad 1
weather 1
once 1
in 1
summer 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
working 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
so 1
warm 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
off 1
that 1
the 1
air 1
might 1
cool 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
his 1
hair 1
it 1
glittered 1
and 1
flashed 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
rays 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
of 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
and 1
up 1
she 1
sprang 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
then 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
cried 1
to 1
him 1
boy 1
bring 1
me 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
flowers 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
cap 1
on 1
with 1
all 1
haste 1
and 1
gathered 1
wild 1
fieldflowers 1
and 1
bound 1
them 1
together 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
ascending 1
the 1
stairs 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
gardener 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
a 1
garland 1
of 1
such 1
common 1
flowers 1
go 1
quickly 1
and 1
get 1
another 1
and 1
seek 1
out 1
the 1
prettiest 1
and 1
rarest 1
oh 1
no 1
replied 1
the 1
boy 1
the 1
wild 1
ones 1
have 1
more 1
scent 1
and 1
will 1
please 1
her 1
better 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
said 1
take 1
your 1
cap 1
off 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
seemly 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
on 1
in 1
my 1
presence 1
he 1
again 1
said 1
i 1
may 1
not 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
sore 1
head 1
she 1
however 1
caught 1
at 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
pulled 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
rolled 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
splendid 1
to 1
behold 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
out 1
but 1
she 1
held 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ducats 1
with 1
these 1
he 1
departed 1
but 1
he 1
cared 1
nothing 1
for 1
the 1
gold 1
pieces 1
he 1
took 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
gardener 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
present 1
them 1
to 1
your 1
children 1
they 1
can 1
play 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
again 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
fieldflowers 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
she 1
instantly 1
snatched 1
at 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
fast 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
she 1
again 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ducats 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
keep 1
them 1
and 1
gave 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
gardener 1
for 1
playthings 1
for 1
his 1
children 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
things 1
went 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
his 1
cap 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
her 1
money 1
not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
overrun 1
by 1
war 1
the 1
king 1
gathered 1
together 1
his 1
people 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
could 1
offer 1
any 1
opposition 1
to 1
the 1
enemy 1
who 1
was 1
superior 1
in 1
strength 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
mighty 1
army 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
gardeners 1
boy 1
i 1
am 1
grown 1
up 1
and 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
wars 1
also 1
only 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
horse 1
the 1
others 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
seek 1
one 1
for 1
yourself 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
gone 1
we 1
will 1
leave 1
one 1
behind 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
forth 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
horse 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
lame 1
of 1
one 1
foot 1
and 1
limped 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
mounted 1
it 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
outskirts 1
he 1
called 1
iron 1
hans 1
three 1
times 1
so 1
loudly 1
that 1
it 1
echoed 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
thereupon 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
appeared 1
immediately 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
i 1
want 1
a 1
strong 1
steed 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
wars 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
ask 1
for 1
then 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
went 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
a 1
stableboy 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
who 1
led 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
snorted 1
with 1
its 1
nostrils 1
and 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
restrained 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
followed 1
a 1
great 1
troop 1
of 1
warriors 1
entirely 1
equipped 1
in 1
iron 1
and 1
their 1
swords 1
flashed 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
youth 1
made 1
over 1
his 1
threelegged 1
horse 1
to 1
the 1
stableboy 1
mounted 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
rode 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
soldiers 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
near 1
the 1
battlefield 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
kings 1
men 1
had 1
already 1
fallen 1
and 1
little 1
was 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
rest 1
give 1
way 1
then 1
the 1
youth 1
galloped 1
thither 1
with 1
his 1
iron 1
soldiers 1
broke 1
like 1
a 1
hurricane 1
over 1
the 1
enemy 1
and 1
beat 1
down 1
all 1
who 1
opposed 1
him 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
flee 1
but 1
the 1
youth 1
pursued 1
and 1
never 1
stopped 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
left 1
instead 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
he 1
conducted 1
his 1
troop 1
by 1
byways 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
called 1
forth 1
iron 1
hans 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
asked 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
take 1
back 1
your 1
horse 1
and 1
your 1
troops 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
my 1
threelegged 1
horse 1
again 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
asked 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
on 1
his 1
threelegged 1
horse 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
palace 1
his 1
daughter 1
went 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
joy 1
of 1
his 1
victory 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
carried 1
away 1
the 1
victory 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
a 1
strange 1
knight 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
assistance 1
with 1
his 1
soldiers 1
the 1
daughter 1
wanted 1
to 1
hear 1
who 1
the 1
strange 1
knight 1
was 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
followed 1
the 1
enemy 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
she 1
inquired 1
of 1
the 1
gardener 1
where 1
his 1
boy 1
was 1
but 1
he 1
smiled 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
has 1
just 1
come 1
home 1
on 1
his 1
threelegged 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
have 1
been 1
mocking 1
him 1
and 1
crying 1
here 1
comes 1
our 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
back 1
again 1
they 1
asked 1
too 1
under 1
what 1
hedge 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
lying 1
sleeping 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
did 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
badly 1
without 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
more 1
ridiculed 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
daughter 1
i 1
will 1
proclaim 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
that 1
shall 1
last 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
throw 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
perhaps 1
the 1
unknown 1
man 1
will 1
show 1
himself 1
when 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
announced 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
called 1
iron 1
hans 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
asked 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
catch 1
the 1
kings 1
daughters 1
golden 1
apple 1
it 1
is 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
it 1
already 1
said 1
iron 1
hans 1
you 1
shall 1
likewise 1
have 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
red 1
armour 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
and 1
ride 1
on 1
a 1
spirited 1
chestnuthorse 1
when 1
the 1
day 1
came 1
the 1
youth 1
galloped 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
amongst 1
the 1
knights 1
and 1
was 1
recognized 1
by 1
no 1
one 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
to 1
the 1
knights 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
caught 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
it 1
he 1
galloped 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
iron 1
hans 1
equipped 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
white 1
knight 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
white 1
horse 1
again 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
linger 1
an 1
instant 1
but 1
galloped 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
king 1
grew 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
allowed 1
he 1
must 1
appear 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
he 1
gave 1
the 1
order 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
should 1
go 1
away 1
again 1
they 1
should 1
pursue 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
willingly 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
cut 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
stab 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
he 1
received 1
from 1
iron 1
hans 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
black 1
armour 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
horse 1
and 1
again 1
he 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
kings 1
attendants 1
pursued 1
him 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
got 1
so 1
near 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
wounded 1
the 1
youths 1
leg 1
with 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
his 1
sword 1
the 1
youth 1
nevertheless 1
escaped 1
from 1
them 1
but 1
his 1
horse 1
leapt 1
so 1
violently 1
that 1
the 1
helmet 1
fell 1
from 1
the 1
youths 1
head 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
golden 1
hair 1
they 1
rode 1
back 1
and 1
announced 1
this 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
asked 1
the 1
gardener 1
about 1
his 1
boy 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
queer 1
creature 1
has 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
festival 1
too 1
and 1
only 1
came 1
home 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
he 1
has 1
likewise 1
shown 1
my 1
children 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
won 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
him 1
summoned 1
into 1
his 1
presence 1
and 1
he 1
came 1
and 1
again 1
had 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
daughter 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
handsome 1
that 1
all 1
were 1
amazed 1
are 1
you 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
came 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
the 1
festival 1
always 1
in 1
different 1
colours 1
and 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
yes 1
answered 1
he 1
and 1
here 1
the 1
apples 1
are 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
returned 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
if 1
you 1
desire 1
further 1
proof 1
you 1
may 1
see 1
the 1
wound 1
which 1
your 1
people 1
gave 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
followed 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
likewise 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
helped 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
victory 1
over 1
your 1
enemies 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
perform 1
such 1
deeds 1
as 1
that 1

mighty 1

plenty 1
as 1
great 1
as 1
i 1
require 1
i 1
well 1

said 1
the 1
king 1
that 1
i 1
owe 1
my 1
thanks 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1

yes 1
answered 1
he 1
that 1
indeed 1
you 1
can 1
give 1
me 1
your 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
the 1
maiden 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
stand 1
much 1
on 1
ceremony 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
seen 1
by 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
gardeners 1
boy 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wedding 1
and 1
were 1
in 1
great 1
delight 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
ever 1
seeing 1
their 1
dear 1
son 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
marriagefeast 1
the 1
music 1
suddenly 1
stopped 1
the 1
doors 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
stately 1
king 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
retinue 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
youth 1
embraced 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
iron 1
hans 1
and 1
was 1
by 1
enchantment 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
all 1
the 1
treasures 1
which 1
i 1
possess 1
shall 1
be 1
your 1
property 1
catskin 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
king 1
whose 1
queen 1
had 1
hair 1
of 1
the 1
purest 1
gold 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
her 1
match 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
met 1
with 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
but 1
this 1
beautiful 1
queen 1
fell 1
ill 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
her 1
end 1
drew 1
near 1
she 1
called 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
marry 1
again 1
unless 1
you 1
meet 1
with 1
a 1
wife 1
who 1
is 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
and 1
who 1
has 1
golden 1
hair 1
like 1
mine 1
then 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
in 1
his 1
grief 1
promised 1
all 1
she 1
asked 1
she 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
comforted 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
taking 1
another 1
wife 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
his 1
wise 1
men 1
said 1
this 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
the 1
king 1
must 1
marry 1
again 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
queen 1
so 1
messengers 1
were 1
sent 1
far 1
and 1
wide 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
a 1
bride 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
the 1
late 1
queen 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
princess 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
still 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
who 1
had 1
golden 1
hair 1
so 1
the 1
messengers 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
had 1
all 1
their 1
trouble 1
for 1
nothing 1
now 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
golden 1
hair 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
grown 1
up 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
like 1
this 1
late 1
queen 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
courtiers 1
may 1
i 1
not 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
image 1
of 1
my 1
dead 1
wife 1
unless 1
i 1
have 1
her 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
any 1
bride 1
upon 1
the 1
whole 1
earth 1
and 1
you 1
say 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
queen 1
when 1
the 1
courtiers 1
heard 1
this 1
they 1
were 1
shocked 1
and 1
said 1
heaven 1
forbid 1
that 1
a 1
father 1
should 1
marry 1
his 1
daughter 1
out 1
of 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
sin 1
no 1
good 1
can 1
come 1
and 1
his 1
daughter 1
was 1
also 1
shocked 1
but 1
hoped 1
the 1
king 1
would 1
soon 1
give 1
up 1
such 1
thoughts 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
i 1
marry 1
anyone 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
three 1
dresses 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
gold 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
another 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
shining 1
silver 1
like 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
a 1
third 1
must 1
be 1
dazzling 1
as 1
the 1
stars 1
besides 1
this 1
i 1
want 1
a 1
mantle 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
different 1
kinds 1
of 1
fur 1
put 1
together 1
to 1
which 1
every 1
beast 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
must 1
give 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
skin 1
and 1
thus 1
she 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
skilful 1
workmen 1
in 1
his 1
kingdom 1
weave 1
the 1
three 1
dresses 1
one 1
golden 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
another 1
silvery 1
like 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
a 1
third 1
sparkling 1
like 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
his 1
hunters 1
were 1
told 1
to 1
hunt 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
in 1
his 1
kingdom 1
and 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
finest 1
fur 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
skins 1
and 1
thus 1
a 1
mantle 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
furs 1
was 1
made 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
ready 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
them 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
asleep 1
and 1
took 1
three 1
of 1
her 1
trinkets 1
a 1
golden 1
ring 1
a 1
golden 1
necklace 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
brooch 1
and 1
packed 1
the 1
three 1
dressesof 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
the 1
starsup 1
in 1
a 1
nutshell 1
and 1
wrapped 1
herself 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
mantle 1
made 1
of 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
fur 1
and 1
besmeared 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
with 1
soot 1
then 1
she 1
threw 1
herself 1
upon 1
heaven 1
for 1
help 1
in 1
her 1
need 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
journeyed 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
wood 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
tired 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
slept 1
on 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
midday 1
now 1
as 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
wood 1
belonged 1
was 1
hunting 1
in 1
it 1
his 1
dogs 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
snuff 1
about 1
and 1
run 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
and 1
bark 1
look 1
sharp 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
game 1
lies 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
tree 1
there 1
lies 1
a 1
most 1
wonderful 1
beast 1
such 1
as 1
we 1
never 1
saw 1
before 1
its 1
skin 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
kinds 1
of 1
fur 1
but 1
there 1
it 1
lies 1
fast 1
asleep 1
see 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
catch 1
it 1
alive 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
it 1
with 1
us 1
so 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
maiden 1
awoke 1
and 1
was 1
greatly 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
child 1
that 1
has 1
neither 1
father 1
nor 1
mother 1
left 1
have 1
pity 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
then 1
they 1
said 1
yes 1
miss 1
catskin 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
for 1
the 1
kitchen 1
you 1
can 1
sweep 1
up 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
do 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
so 1
they 1
put 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
coach 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
kings 1
palace 1
then 1
they 1
showed 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
corner 1
under 1
the 1
staircase 1
where 1
no 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
ever 1
peeped 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
catskin 1
you 1
may 1
lie 1
and 1
sleep 1
there 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
sent 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
made 1
to 1
fetch 1
wood 1
and 1
water 1
to 1
blow 1
the 1
fire 1
pluck 1
the 1
poultry 1
pick 1
the 1
herbs 1
sift 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
dirty 1
work 1
thus 1
catskin 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
very 1
sorrowfully 1
ah 1
pretty 1
princess 1
thought 1
she 1
what 1
will 1
now 1
become 1
of 1
thee 1
but 1
it 1
happened 1
one 1
day 1
that 1
a 1
feast 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
in 1
the 1
kings 1
castle 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
cook 1
may 1
i 1
go 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
and 1
stand 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
yes 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
but 1
be 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hours 1
time 1
to 1
rake 1
out 1
the 1
ashes 1
then 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
little 1
lamp 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
cabin 1
and 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
fur 1
skin 1
and 1
washed 1
the 1
soot 1
from 1
off 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
beauty 1
shone 1
forth 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
clouds 1
she 1
next 1
opened 1
her 1
nutshell 1
and 1
brought 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
dress 1
that 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
so 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
everyone 1
made 1
way 1
for 1
her 1
for 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
kings 1
daughter 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
one 1
half 1
so 1
beautiful 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
she 1
curtsied 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
round 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
wither 1
the 1
guards 1
that 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
were 1
called 1
in 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
no 1
one 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
pulled 1
off 1
her 1
dress 1
blackened 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
furskin 1
cloak 1
and 1
was 1
catskin 1
again 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
her 1
work 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
rake 1
the 1
ashes 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
let 1
that 1
alone 1
till 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
heat 1
the 1
kings 1
soup 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
run 1
up 1
now 1
and 1
give 1
a 1
peep 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
dont 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
run 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
never 1
eating 1
again 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
cook 1
went 1
away 1
catskin 1
heated 1
the 1
kings 1
soup 1
and 1
toasted 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
first 1
as 1
nicely 1
as 1
ever 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
for 1
her 1
little 1
golden 1
ring 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
soup 1
was 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
his 1
soup 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
in 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
tasted 1
any 1
so 1
good 1
before 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
lying 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
out 1
how 1
it 1
had 1
got 1
there 1
he 1
ordered 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
be 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
cook 1
was 1
frightened 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
order 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
catskin 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
soup 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
beating 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
cooked 1
the 1
soup 1
i 1
did 1
answered 1
the 1
cook 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
it 1
was 1
better 1
done 1
than 1
you 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
answered 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
cook 1
it 1
but 1
catskin 1
did 1
then 1
let 1
catskin 1
come 1
up 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
child 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
has 1
lost 1
both 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
how 1
came 1
you 1
in 1
my 1
palace 1
asked 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
said 1
she 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
sculliongirl 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
boots 1
and 1
shoes 1
thrown 1
at 1
my 1
head 1
but 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
soup 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
own 1
that 1
she 1
knew 1
anything 1
about 1
the 1
ring 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
her 1
away 1
again 1
about 1
her 1
business 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
feast 1
and 1
catskin 1
asked 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
up 1
and 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
before 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
come 1
again 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
cook 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
soup 1
that 1
he 1
likes 1
so 1
much 1
then 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
washed 1
herself 1
quickly 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
dress 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
silvery 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
kings 1
daughter 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
rejoiced 1
at 1
seeing 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
began 1
he 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
after 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
she 1
managed 1
to 1
slip 1
out 1
so 1
slyly 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
she 1
sprang 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
and 1
made 1
herself 1
into 1
catskin 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
cook 1
the 1
soup 1
whilst 1
the 1
cook 1
was 1
above 1
stairs 1
she 1
got 1
the 1
golden 1
necklace 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
soup 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
him 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
before 1
so 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
cook 1
who 1
was 1
again 1
forced 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
catskin 1
had 1
cooked 1
it 1
catskin 1
was 1
brought 1
again 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
but 1
she 1
still 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
fit 1
to 1
have 1
boots 1
and 1
shoes 1
thrown 1
at 1
her 1
head 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
ordered 1
a 1
feast 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
it 1
happened 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
before 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
witch 1
catskin 1
said 1
the 1
cook 1
for 1
you 1
always 1
put 1
something 1
into 1
your 1
soup 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
pleases 1
the 1
king 1
better 1
than 1
mine 1
however 1
he 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
up 1
as 1
before 1
then 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
dress 1
which 1
sparkled 1
like 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
ballroom 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
thought 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
then 1
so 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
dancing 1
with 1
her 1
he 1
put 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
on 1
her 1
finger 1
without 1
her 1
seeing 1
it 1
and 1
ordered 1
that 1
the 1
dance 1
should 1
be 1
kept 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
held 1
her 1
fast 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
but 1
she 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
sprang 1
so 1
quickly 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
that 1
he 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
ran 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
under 1
the 1
stairs 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
kept 1
away 1
too 1
long 1
and 1
stayed 1
beyond 1
the 1
halfhour 1
so 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
her 1
fine 1
dress 1
and 1
threw 1
her 1
fur 1
mantle 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
haste 1
did 1
not 1
blacken 1
herself 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
soot 1
but 1
left 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
fingers 1
white 1
then 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
cooked 1
the 1
kings 1
soup 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
cook 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
golden 1
brooch 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
he 1
ordered 1
catskin 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
soon 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
finger 1
and 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
on 1
it 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
dancing 1
so 1
he 1
seized 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
kept 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
loose 1
herself 1
and 1
spring 1
away 1
the 1
fur 1
cloak 1
fell 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
starry 1
dress 1
sparkled 1
underneath 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
fur 1
and 1
tore 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
her 1
golden 1
hair 1
and 1
beautiful 1
form 1
were 1
seen 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
hide 1
herself 1
so 1
she 1
washed 1
the 1
soot 1
and 1
ashes 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
showed 1
herself 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
beloved 1
bride 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
never 1
more 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
a 1
merry 1
day 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
ever 1
was 1
heard 1
of 1
or 1
seen 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
or 1
indeed 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
rosered 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
poor 1
widow 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
lonely 1
cottage 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
wherein 1
stood 1
two 1
rosetrees 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
bore 1
white 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
red 1
roses 1
she 1
had 1
two 1
children 1
who 1
were 1
like 1
the 1
two 1
rosetrees 1
and 1
one 1
was 1
called 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
rosered 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
good 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
busy 1
and 1
cheerful 1
as 1
ever 1
two 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
only 1
snowwhite 1
was 1
more 1
quiet 1
and 1
gentle 1
than 1
rosered 1
rosered 1
liked 1
better 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
meadows 1
and 1
fields 1
seeking 1
flowers 1
and 1
catching 1
butterflies 1
but 1
snowwhite 1
sat 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
helped 1
her 1
with 1
her 1
housework 1
or 1
read 1
to 1
her 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
were 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
one 1
another 1
that 1
they 1
always 1
held 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
when 1
snowwhite 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
leave 1
each 1
other 1
rosered 1
answered 1
never 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
live 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
would 1
add 1
what 1
one 1
has 1
she 1
must 1
share 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
often 1
ran 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
alone 1
and 1
gathered 1
red 1
berries 1
and 1
no 1
beasts 1
did 1
them 1
any 1
harm 1
but 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
them 1
trustfully 1
the 1
little 1
hare 1
would 1
eat 1
a 1
cabbageleaf 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
hands 1
the 1
roe 1
grazed 1
by 1
their 1
side 1
the 1
stag 1
leapt 1
merrily 1
by 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
sat 1
still 1
upon 1
the 1
boughs 1
and 1
sang 1
whatever 1
they 1
knew 1
no 1
mishap 1
overtook 1
them 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
stayed 1
too 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
they 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
near 1
one 1
another 1
upon 1
the 1
moss 1
and 1
slept 1
until 1
morning 1
came 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
knew 1
this 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
worry 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
once 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
the 1
dawn 1
had 1
roused 1
them 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
child 1
in 1
a 1
shining 1
white 1
dress 1
sitting 1
near 1
their 1
bed 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
quite 1
kindly 1
at 1
them 1
but 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
looked 1
round 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
precipice 1
and 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
fallen 1
into 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
further 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
angel 1
who 1
watches 1
over 1
good 1
children 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
rosered 1
kept 1
their 1
mothers 1
little 1
cottage 1
so 1
neat 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
look 1
inside 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
rosered 1
took 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
every 1
morning 1
laid 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
flowers 1
by 1
her 1
mothers 1
bed 1
before 1
she 1
awoke 1
in 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
rose 1
from 1
each 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
winter 1
snowwhite 1
lit 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
hung 1
the 1
kettle 1
on 1
the 1
hob 1
the 1
kettle 1
was 1
of 1
brass 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
gold 1
so 1
brightly 1
was 1
it 1
polished 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
the 1
snowflakes 1
fell 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
go 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
bolt 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
sat 1
round 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
took 1
her 1
spectacles 1
and 1
read 1
aloud 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
book 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
girls 1
listened 1
as 1
they 1
sat 1
and 1
spun 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
lay 1
a 1
lamb 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
upon 1
a 1
perch 1
sat 1
a 1
white 1
dove 1
with 1
its 1
head 1
hidden 1
beneath 1
its 1
wings 1
one 1
evening 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
thus 1
sitting 1
comfortably 1
together 1
someone 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
in 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
quick 1
rosered 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
traveller 1
who 1
is 1
seeking 1
shelter 1
rosered 1
went 1
and 1
pushed 1
back 1
the 1
bolt 1
thinking 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bear 1
that 1
stretched 1
his 1
broad 1
black 1
head 1
within 1
the 1
door 1
rosered 1
screamed 1
and 1
sprang 1
back 1
the 1
lamb 1
bleated 1
the 1
dove 1
fluttered 1
and 1
snowwhite 1
hid 1
herself 1
behind 1
her 1
mothers 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
bear 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
i 1
am 1
halffrozen 1
and 1
only 1
want 1
to 1
warm 1
myself 1
a 1
little 1
beside 1
you 1
poor 1
bear 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
lie 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
only 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
burn 1
your 1
coat 1
then 1
she 1
cried 1
snowwhite 1
rosered 1
come 1
out 1
the 1
bear 1
will 1
do 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
he 1
means 1
well 1
so 1
they 1
both 1
came 1
out 1
and 1
byandby 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
dove 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
bear 1
said 1
here 1
children 1
knock 1
the 1
snow 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
coat 1
a 1
little 1
so 1
they 1
brought 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
swept 1
the 1
bears 1
hide 1
clean 1
and 1
he 1
stretched 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
growled 1
contentedly 1
and 1
comfortably 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
grew 1
quite 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
played 1
tricks 1
with 1
their 1
clumsy 1
guest 1
they 1
tugged 1
his 1
hair 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
put 1
their 1
feet 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
rolled 1
him 1
about 1
or 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
hazelswitch 1
and 1
beat 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
growled 1
they 1
laughed 1
but 1
the 1
bear 1
took 1
it 1
all 1
in 1
good 1
part 1
only 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
rough 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
leave 1
me 1
alive 1
children 1
snowwhite 1
rosered 1
will 1
you 1
beat 1
your 1
wooer 1
dead 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
bedtime 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
bear 1
you 1
can 1
lie 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
from 1
the 1
cold 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
weather 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
day 1
dawned 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
let 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
trotted 1
across 1
the 1
snow 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
henceforth 1
the 1
bear 1
came 1
every 1
evening 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
children 1
amuse 1
themselves 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
they 1
liked 1
and 1
they 1
got 1
so 1
used 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
never 1
fastened 1
until 1
their 1
black 1
friend 1
had 1
arrived 1
when 1
spring 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
all 1
outside 1
was 1
green 1
the 1
bear 1
said 1
one 1
morning 1
to 1
snowwhite 1
now 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
and 1
cannot 1
come 1
back 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
summer 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
then 1
dear 1
bear 1
asked 1
snowwhite 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
guard 1
my 1
treasures 1
from 1
the 1
wicked 1
dwarfs 1
in 1
the 1
winter 1
when 1
the 1
earth 1
is 1
frozen 1
hard 1
they 1
are 1
obliged 1
to 1
stay 1
below 1
and 1
cannot 1
work 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
has 1
thawed 1
and 1
warmed 1
the 1
earth 1
they 1
break 1
through 1
it 1
and 1
come 1
out 1
to 1
pry 1
and 1
steal 1
and 1
what 1
once 1
gets 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
in 1
their 1
caves 1
does 1
not 1
easily 1
see 1
daylight 1
again 1
snowwhite 1
was 1
quite 1
sorry 1
at 1
his 1
departure 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
unbolted 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
was 1
hurrying 1
out 1
he 1
caught 1
against 1
the 1
bolt 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
his 1
hairy 1
coat 1
was 1
torn 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
snowwhite 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
gold 1
shining 1
through 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
about 1
it 1
the 1
bear 1
ran 1
away 1
quickly 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
behind 1
the 1
trees 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
afterwards 1
the 1
mother 1
sent 1
her 1
children 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
get 1
firewood 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
big 1
tree 1
which 1
lay 1
felled 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
trunk 1
something 1
was 1
jumping 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
nearer 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
dwarf 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
withered 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
snowwhite 1
beard 1
a 1
yard 1
long 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
beard 1
was 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
crevice 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
fellow 1
was 1
jumping 1
about 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
tied 1
to 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
glared 1
at 1
the 1
girls 1
with 1
his 1
fiery 1
red 1
eyes 1
and 1
cried 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
stand 1
there 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
come 1
here 1
and 1
help 1
me 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
little 1
man 1
asked 1
rosered 1
you 1
stupid 1
prying 1
goose 1
answered 1
the 1
dwarf 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
split 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
little 1
wood 1
for 1
cooking 1
the 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
food 1
that 1
we 1
people 1
get 1
is 1
immediately 1
burnt 1
up 1
with 1
heavy 1
logs 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
swallow 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
coarse 1
greedy 1
folk 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
driven 1
the 1
wedge 1
safely 1
in 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
as 1
i 1
wished 1
but 1
the 1
cursed 1
wedge 1
was 1
too 1
smooth 1
and 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
tree 1
closed 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
pull 1
out 1
my 1
beautiful 1
white 1
beard 1
so 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
tight 1
and 1
i 1
cannot 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
silly 1
sleek 1
milkfaced 1
things 1
laugh 1
ugh 1
how 1
odious 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
children 1
tried 1
very 1
hard 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
pull 1
the 1
beard 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
caught 1
too 1
fast 1
i 1
will 1
run 1
and 1
fetch 1
someone 1
said 1
rosered 1
you 1
senseless 1
goose 1
snarled 1
the 1
dwarf 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
fetch 1
someone 1
you 1
are 1
already 1
two 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
better 1
dont 1
be 1
impatient 1
said 1
snowwhite 1
i 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
and 1
she 1
pulled 1
her 1
scissors 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
beard 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
felt 1
himself 1
free 1
he 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
a 1
bag 1
which 1
lay 1
amongst 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
grumbling 1
to 1
himself 1
uncouth 1
people 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
my 1
fine 1
beard 1
bad 1
luck 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
swung 1
the 1
bag 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
without 1
even 1
once 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
children 1
some 1
time 1
afterwards 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
rosered 1
went 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
fish 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
brook 1
they 1
saw 1
something 1
like 1
a 1
large 1
grasshopper 1
jumping 1
towards 1
the 1
water 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
leap 1
in 1
they 1
ran 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
dwarf 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
said 1
rosered 1
you 1
surely 1
dont 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
cried 1
the 1
dwarf 1
dont 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
accursed 1
fish 1
wants 1
to 1
pull 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
there 1
fishing 1
and 1
unluckily 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
tangled 1
up 1
his 1
beard 1
with 1
the 1
fishingline 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
a 1
big 1
fish 1
made 1
a 1
bite 1
and 1
the 1
feeble 1
creature 1
had 1
not 1
strength 1
to 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
the 1
fish 1
kept 1
the 1
upper 1
hand 1
and 1
pulled 1
the 1
dwarf 1
towards 1
him 1
he 1
held 1
on 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
reeds 1
and 1
rushes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
little 1
good 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
the 1
fish 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
urgent 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
dragged 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
the 1
girls 1
came 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
they 1
held 1
him 1
fast 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
free 1
his 1
beard 1
from 1
the 1
line 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
beard 1
and 1
line 1
were 1
entangled 1
fast 1
together 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
to 1
bring 1
out 1
the 1
scissors 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
beard 1
whereby 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
lost 1
when 1
the 1
dwarf 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
screamed 1
out 1
is 1
that 1
civil 1
you 1
toadstool 1
to 1
disfigure 1
a 1
mans 1
face 1
was 1
it 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
clip 1
off 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
beard 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
best 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
cannot 1
let 1
myself 1
be 1
seen 1
by 1
my 1
people 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
soles 1
off 1
your 1
shoes 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
sack 1
of 1
pearls 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
rushes 1
and 1
without 1
another 1
word 1
he 1
dragged 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
disappeared 1
behind 1
a 1
stone 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
mother 1
sent 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
buy 1
needles 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
laces 1
and 1
ribbons 1
the 1
road 1
led 1
them 1
across 1
a 1
heath 1
upon 1
which 1
huge 1
pieces 1
of 1
rock 1
lay 1
strewn 1
about 1
there 1
they 1
noticed 1
a 1
large 1
bird 1
hovering 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
flying 1
slowly 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
above 1
them 1
it 1
sank 1
lower 1
and 1
lower 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
settled 1
near 1
a 1
rock 1
not 1
far 1
away 1
immediately 1
they 1
heard 1
a 1
loud 1
piteous 1
cry 1
they 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
with 1
horror 1
that 1
the 1
eagle 1
had 1
seized 1
their 1
old 1
acquaintance 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
off 1
the 1
children 1
full 1
of 1
pity 1
at 1
once 1
took 1
tight 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
pulled 1
against 1
the 1
eagle 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
his 1
booty 1
go 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
first 1
fright 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
his 1
shrill 1
voice 1
could 1
you 1
not 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
more 1
carefully 1
you 1
dragged 1
at 1
my 1
brown 1
coat 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
torn 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
you 1
clumsy 1
creatures 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
a 1
sack 1
full 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
and 1
slipped 1
away 1
again 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
into 1
his 1
hole 1
the 1
girls 1
who 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
were 1
used 1
to 1
his 1
ingratitude 1
went 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
and 1
did 1
their 1
business 1
in 1
town 1
as 1
they 1
crossed 1
the 1
heath 1
again 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
they 1
surprised 1
the 1
dwarf 1
who 1
had 1
emptied 1
out 1
his 1
bag 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
in 1
a 1
clean 1
spot 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
that 1
anyone 1
would 1
come 1
there 1
so 1
late 1
the 1
evening 1
sun 1
shone 1
upon 1
the 1
brilliant 1
stones 1
they 1
glittered 1
and 1
sparkled 1
with 1
all 1
colours 1
so 1
beautifully 1
that 1
the 1
children 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
them 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
stand 1
gaping 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
his 1
ashengrey 1
face 1
became 1
copperred 1
with 1
rage 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
cursing 1
when 1
a 1
loud 1
growling 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
bear 1
came 1
trotting 1
towards 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
dwarf 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
fright 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
reach 1
his 1
cave 1
for 1
the 1
bear 1
was 1
already 1
close 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
dread 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
cried 1
dear 1
mr 1
bear 1
spare 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
treasures 1
look 1
the 1
beautiful 1
jewels 1
lying 1
there 1
grant 1
me 1
my 1
life 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
slender 1
little 1
fellow 1
as 1
i 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
feel 1
me 1
between 1
your 1
teeth 1
come 1
take 1
these 1
two 1
wicked 1
girls 1
they 1
are 1
tender 1
morsels 1
for 1
you 1
fat 1
as 1
young 1
quails 1
for 1
mercys 1
sake 1
eat 1
them 1
the 1
bear 1
took 1
no 1
heed 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
but 1
gave 1
the 1
wicked 1
creature 1
a 1
single 1
blow 1
with 1
his 1
paw 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
again 1
the 1
girls 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
bear 1
called 1
to 1
them 1
snowwhite 1
and 1
rosered 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
wait 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
then 1
they 1
recognized 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
waited 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
suddenly 1
his 1
bearskin 1
fell 1
off 1
and 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
a 1
handsome 1
man 1
clothed 1
all 1
in 1
gold 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
kings 1
son 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
bewitched 1
by 1
that 1
wicked 1
dwarf 1
who 1
had 1
stolen 1
my 1
treasures 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
as 1
a 1
savage 1
bear 1
until 1
i 1
was 1
freed 1
by 1
his 1
death 1
now 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
his 1
welldeserved 1
punishment 1
snowwhite 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
rosered 1
to 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
they 1
divided 1
between 1
them 1
the 1
great 1
treasure 1
which 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
gathered 1
together 1
in 1
his 1
cave 1
the 1
old 1
mother 1
lived 1
peacefully 1
and 1
happily 1
with 1
her 1
children 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
two 1
rosetrees 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
stood 1
before 1
her 1
window 1
and 1
every 1
year 1
bore 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
roses 1
white 1
and 1
red 1
the 1
brothers 1
grimm 1
jacob 1
17851863 1
and 1
wilhelm 1
17861859 1
were 1
born 1
in 1
hanau 1
near 1
frankfurt 1
in 1
the 1
german 1
state 1
of 1
hesse 1
throughout 1
their 1
lives 1
they 1
remained 1
close 1
friends 1
and 1
both 1
studied 1
law 1
at 1
marburg 1
university 1
jacob 1
was 1
a 1
pioneer 1
in 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
german 1
philology 1
and 1
although 1
wilhelms 1
work 1
was 1
hampered 1
by 1
poor 1
health 1
the 1
brothers 1
collaborated 1
in 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
german 1
dictionary 1
not 1
completed 1
until 1
a 1
century 1
after 1
their 1
deaths 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
best 1
and 1
universally 1
known 1
for 1
the 1
collection 1
of 1
over 1
two 1
hundred 1
folk 1
tales 1
they 1
made 1
from 1
oral 1
sources 1
and 1
published 1
in 1
two 1
volumes 1
of 1
nursery 1
and 1
household 1
tales 1
in 1
1812 1
and 1
1814 1
although 1
their 1
intention 1
was 1
to 1
preserve 1
such 1
material 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
german 1
cultural 1
and 1
literary 1
history 1
and 1
their 1
collection 1
was 1
first 1
published 1
with 1
scholarly 1
notes 1
and 1
no 1

the 1
tales 1
soon 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
young 1
readers 1
this 1
was 1
in 1
part 1
due 1
to 1
edgar 1
taylor 1
who 1
made 1
the 1
first 1

translation 1
in 1
1823 1
selecting 1
about 1
fifty 1
stories 1
with 1
the 1

of 1
some 1
young 1

principally 1
in 1
