hope 1
soon 1
quit 1
this 1
melancholy 1
abode 1
for 1
doubtless 1
evidence 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
free 1
you 1
from 1
the 1
criminal 1
charge 1
that 1
is 1
my 1
least 1
concern 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
strange 1
events 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
mortals 1
persecuted 1
and 1
tortured 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
and 1
have 1
been 1
can 1
death 1
be 1
any 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
nothing 1
indeed 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
agonizing 1
than 1
the 1
strange 1
chances 1
that 1
have 1
lately 1
occurred 1
you 1
were 1
thrown 1
by 1
some 1
surprising 1
accident 1
on 1
this 1
shore 1
renowned 1
for 1
its 1
hospitality 1
seized 1
immediately 1
and 1
charged 1
with 1
murder 1
the 1
first 1
sight 1
that 1
was 1
presented 1
to 1
your 1
eyes 1
was 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
your 1
friend 1
murdered 1
in 1
so 1
unaccountable 1
a 1
manner 1
and 1
placed 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
by 1
some 1
fiend 1
across 1
your 1
path 1
as 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
said 1
this 1
notwithstanding 1
the 1
agitation 1
i 1
endured 1
on 1
this 1
retrospect 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
i 1
also 1
felt 1
considerable 1
surprise 1
at 1
the 1
knowledge 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
possess 1
concerning 1
me 1
i 1
suppose 1
some 1
astonishment 1
was 1
exhibited 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
for 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
hastened 1
to 1
say 1
immediately 1
upon 1
your 1
being 1
taken 1
ill 1
all 1
the 1
papers 1
that 1
were 1
on 1
your 1
person 1
were 1
brought 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
examined 1
them 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
discover 1
some 1
trace 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
send 1
to 1
your 1
relations 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
your 1
misfortune 1
and 1
illness 1
i 1
found 1
several 1
letters 1
and 1
among 1
others 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
discovered 1
from 1
its 1
commencement 1
to 1
be 1
from 1
your 1
father 1
i 1
instantly 1
wrote 1
to 1
geneva 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
my 1
letter 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
even 1
now 1
you 1
tremble 1
you 1
are 1
unfit 1
for 1
agitation 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
this 1
suspense 1
is 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
event 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
death 1
has 1
been 1
acted 1
and 1
whose 1
murder 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
to 1
lament 1
your 1
family 1
is 1
perfectly 1
well 1
said 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
someone 1
a 1
friend 1
is 1
come 1
to 1
visit 1
you 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
by 1
what 1
chain 1
of 1
thought 1
the 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
but 1
it 1
instantly 1
darted 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
and 1
taunt 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
clerval 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
incitement 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
hellish 1
desires 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
in 1
agony 1
oh 1
take 1
him 1
away 1
i 1
cannot 1
see 1
him 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
enter 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
regarded 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
troubled 1
countenance 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
regarding 1
my 1
exclamation 1
as 1
a 1
presumption 1
of 1
my 1
guilt 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
severe 1
tone 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
young 1
man 1
that 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
your 1
father 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
welcome 1
instead 1
of 1
inspiring 1
such 1
violent 1
repugnance 1
my 1
father 1
cried 1
i 1
while 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
every 1
muscle 1
was 1
relaxed 1
from 1
anguish 1
to 1
pleasure 1
is 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
come 1
how 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
kind 1
but 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
hasten 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
manner 1
surprised 1
and 1
pleased 1
the 1
magistrate 1
perhaps 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
former 1
exclamation 1
was 1
a 1
momentary 1
return 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
instantly 1
resumed 1
his 1
former 1
benevolence 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
my 1
nurse 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
it 1
nothing 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
could 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
greater 1
pleasure 1
than 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
stretched 1
out 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
cried 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
safeand 1
elizabethand 1
ernest 1
my 1
father 1
calmed 1
me 1
with 1
assurances 1
of 1
their 1
welfare 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
so 1
interesting 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
raise 1
my 1
desponding 1
spirits 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
felt 1
that 1
a 1
prison 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
abode 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
what 1
a 1
place 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
you 1
inhabit 1
my 1
son 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
mournfully 1
at 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
you 1
travelled 1
to 1
seek 1
happiness 1
but 1
a 1
fatality 1
seems 1
to 1
pursue 1
you 1
and 1
poor 1
clerval 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
murdered 1
friend 1
was 1
an 1
agitation 1
too 1
great 1
to 1
be 1
endured 1
in 1
my 1
weak 1
state 1
i 1
shed 1
tears 1
alas 1
yes 1
my 1
father 1
replied 1
i 1
some 1
destiny 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
kind 1
hangs 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
or 1
surely 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
henry 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
for 1
any 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
precarious 1
state 1
of 1
my 1
health 1
rendered 1
every 1
precaution 1
necessary 1
that 1
could 1
ensure 1
tranquillity 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
insisted 1
that 1
my 1
strength 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
exhausted 1
by 1
too 1
much 1
exertion 1
but 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
angel 1
and 1
i 1
gradually 1
recovered 1
my 1
health 1
as 1
my 1
sickness 1
quitted 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
absorbed 1
by 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
black 1
melancholy 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
dissipate 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
clerval 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
me 1
ghastly 1
and 1
murdered 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
the 1
agitation 1
into 1
which 1
these 1
reflections 1
threw 1
me 1
made 1
my 1
friends 1
dread 1
a 1
dangerous 1
relapse 1
alas 1
why 1
did 1
they 1
preserve 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
detested 1
a 1
life 1
it 1
was 1
surely 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
fulfil 1
my 1
destiny 1
which 1
is 1
now 1
drawing 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
soon 1
oh 1
very 1
soon 1
will 1
death 1
extinguish 1
these 1
throbbings 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
mighty 1
weight 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
bears 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
dust 1
and 1
in 1
executing 1
the 1
award 1
of 1
justice 1
i 1
shall 1
also 1
sink 1
to 1
rest 1
then 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
death 1
was 1
distant 1
although 1
the 1
wish 1
was 1
ever 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
sat 1
for 1
hours 1
motionless 1
and 1
speechless 1
wishing 1
for 1
some 1
mighty 1
revolution 1
that 1
might 1
bury 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
destroyer 1
in 1
its 1
ruins 1
the 1
season 1
of 1
the 1
assizes 1
approached 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
three 1
months 1
in 1
prison 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
weak 1
and 1
in 1
continual 1
danger 1
of 1
a 1
relapse 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
travel 1
nearly 1
a 1
hundred 1
miles 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
town 1
where 1
the 1
court 1
was 1
held 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
charged 1
himself 1
with 1
every 1
care 1
of 1
collecting 1
witnesses 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
defence 1
i 1
was 1
spared 1
the 1
disgrace 1
of 1
appearing 1
publicly 1
as 1
a 1
criminal 1
as 1
the 1
case 1
was 1
not 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
decides 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
the 1
grand 1
jury 1
rejected 1
the 1
bill 1
on 1
its 1
being 1
proved 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
orkney 1
islands 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
was 1
found 1
and 1
a 1
fortnight 1
after 1
my 1
removal 1
i 1
was 1
liberated 1
from 1
prison 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
enraptured 1
on 1
finding 1
me 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
vexations 1
of 1
a 1
criminal 1
charge 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
again 1
allowed 1
to 1
breathe 1
the 1
fresh 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
permitted 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
participate 1
in 1
these 1
feelings 1
for 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
or 1
a 1
palace 1
were 1
alike 1
hateful 1
the 1
cup 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
poisoned 1
forever 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
upon 1
me 1
as 1
upon 1
the 1
happy 1
and 1
gay 1
of 1
heart 1
i 1
saw 1
around 1
me 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
dense 1
and 1
frightful 1
darkness 1
penetrated 1
by 1
no 1
light 1
but 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
two 1
eyes 1
that 1
glared 1
upon 1
me 1
sometimes 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
expressive 1
eyes 1
of 1
henry 1
languishing 1
in 1
death 1
the 1
dark 1
orbs 1
nearly 1
covered 1
by 1
the 1
lids 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
black 1
lashes 1
that 1
fringed 1
them 1
sometimes 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
watery 1
clouded 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
as 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
chamber 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
my 1
father 1
tried 1
to 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
he 1
talked 1
of 1
geneva 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
visit 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
ernest 1
but 1
these 1
words 1
only 1
drew 1
deep 1
groans 1
from 1
me 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
thought 1
with 1
melancholy 1
delight 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cousin 1
or 1
longed 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
maladie 1
du 1
pays 1
to 1
see 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
rapid 1
rhone 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
early 1
childhood 1
but 1
my 1
general 1
state 1
of 1
feeling 1
was 1
a 1
torpor 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
prison 1
was 1
as 1
welcome 1
a 1
residence 1
as 1
the 1
divinest 1
scene 1
in 1
nature 1
and 1
these 1
fits 1
were 1
seldom 1
interrupted 1
but 1
by 1
paroxysms 1
of 1
anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
i 1
loathed 1
and 1
it 1
required 1
unceasing 1
attendance 1
and 1
vigilance 1
to 1
restrain 1
me 1
from 1
committing 1
some 1
dreadful 1
act 1
of 1
violence 1
yet 1
one 1
duty 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
which 1
finally 1
triumphed 1
over 1
my 1
selfish 1
despair 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
return 1
without 1
delay 1
to 1
geneva 1
there 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
those 1
i 1
so 1
fondly 1
loved 1
and 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
murderer 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
chance 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
his 1
concealment 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
dared 1
again 1
to 1
blast 1
me 1
by 1
his 1
presence 1
i 1
might 1
with 1
unfailing 1
aim 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
monstrous 1
image 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
endued 1
with 1
the 1
mockery 1
of 1
a 1
soul 1
still 1
more 1
monstrous 1
my 1
father 1
still 1
desired 1
to 1
delay 1
our 1
departure 1
fearful 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
fatigues 1
of 1
a 1
journey 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
shattered 1
wreckthe 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
my 1
strength 1
was 1
gone 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
mere 1
skeleton 1
and 1
fever 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
wasted 1
frame 1
still 1
as 1
i 1
urged 1
our 1
leaving 1
ireland 1
with 1
such 1
inquietude 1
and 1
impatience 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
yield 1
we 1
took 1
our 1
passage 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
havredegrace 1
and 1
sailed 1
with 1
a 1
fair 1
wind 1
from 1
the 1
irish 1
shores 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
i 1
hailed 1
the 1
darkness 1
that 1
shut 1
ireland 1
from 1
my 1
sight 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
with 1
a 1
feverish 1
joy 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
see 1
geneva 1
the 1
past 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
frightful 1
dream 1
yet 1
the 1
vessel 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
blew 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
detested 1
shore 1
of 1
ireland 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
surrounded 1
me 1
told 1
me 1
too 1
forcibly 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
deceived 1
by 1
no 1
vision 1
and 1
that 1
clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
dearest 1
companion 1
had 1
fallen 1
a 1
victim 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
monster 1
of 1
my 1
creation 1
i 1
repassed 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
my 1
whole 1
lifemy 1
quiet 1
happiness 1
while 1
residing 1
with 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
geneva 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
remembered 1
shuddering 1
the 1
mad 1
enthusiasm 1
that 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
enemy 1
and 1
i 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
lived 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
thought 1
a 1
thousand 1
feelings 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
ever 1
since 1
my 1
recovery 1
from 1
the 1
fever 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
taking 1
every 1
night 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
of 1
laudanum 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
this 1
drug 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
rest 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
preservation 1
of 1
life 1
oppressed 1
by 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
now 1
swallowed 1
double 1
my 1
usual 1
quantity 1
and 1
soon 1
slept 1
profoundly 1
but 1
sleep 1
did 1
not 1
afford 1
me 1
respite 1
from 1
thought 1
and 1
misery 1
my 1
dreams 1
presented 1
a 1
thousand 1
objects 1
that 1
scared 1
me 1
towards 1
morning 1
i 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
nightmare 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
fiends 1
grasp 1
in 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
free 1
myself 1
from 1
it 1
groans 1
and 1
cries 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
my 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
watching 1
over 1
me 1
perceiving 1
my 1
restlessness 1
awoke 1
me 1
the 1
dashing 1
waves 1
were 1
around 1
the 1
cloudy 1
sky 1
above 1
the 1
fiend 1
was 1
not 1
here 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
a 1
truce 1
was 1
established 1
between 1
the 1
present 1
hour 1
and 1
the 1
irresistible 1
disastrous 1
future 1
imparted 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
calm 1
forgetfulness 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
is 1
by 1
its 1
structure 1
peculiarly 1

the 1
voyage 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
we 1
landed 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
paris 1
i 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
overtaxed 1
my 1
strength 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
repose 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
my 1
fathers 1
care 1
and 1
attentions 1
were 1
indefatigable 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
and 1
sought 1
erroneous 1
methods 1
to 1
remedy 1
the 1
incurable 1
ill 1
he 1
wished 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
amusement 1
in 1
society 1
i 1
abhorred 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
oh 1
not 1
abhorred 1
they 1
were 1
my 1
brethren 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
attracted 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
repulsive 1
among 1
them 1
as 1
to 1
creatures 1
of 1
an 1
angelic 1
nature 1
and 1
celestial 1
mechanism 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
share 1
their 1
intercourse 1
i 1
had 1
unchained 1
an 1
enemy 1
among 1
them 1
whose 1
joy 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
and 1
to 1
revel 1
in 1
their 1
groans 1
how 1
they 1
would 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
abhor 1
me 1
and 1
hunt 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
they 1
know 1
my 1
unhallowed 1
acts 1
and 1
the 1
crimes 1
which 1
had 1
their 1
source 1
in 1
me 1
my 1
father 1
yielded 1
at 1
length 1
to 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
avoid 1
society 1
and 1
strove 1
by 1
various 1
arguments 1
to 1
banish 1
my 1
despair 1
sometimes 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
deeply 1
the 1
degradation 1
of 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
answer 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
prove 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
pride 1
alas 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
i 1
how 1
little 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
human 1
beings 1
their 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
degraded 1
if 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
i 1
felt 1
pride 1
justine 1
poor 1
unhappy 1
justine 1
was 1
as 1
innocent 1
as 1
i 1
and 1
she 1
suffered 1
the 1
same 1
charge 1
she 1
died 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
thisi 1
murdered 1
her 1
william 1
justine 1
and 1
henrythey 1
all 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
hands 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
often 1
during 1
my 1
imprisonment 1
heard 1
me 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
assertion 1
when 1
i 1
thus 1
accused 1
myself 1
he 1
sometimes 1
seemed 1
to 1
desire 1
an 1
explanation 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
consider 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
that 1
during 1
my 1
illness 1
some 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
had 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
preserved 1
in 1
my 1
convalescence 1
i 1
avoided 1
explanation 1
and 1
maintained 1
a 1
continual 1
silence 1
concerning 1
the 1
wretch 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
persuasion 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
supposed 1
mad 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
would 1
forever 1
have 1
chained 1
my 1
tongue 1
but 1
besides 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
would 1
fill 1
my 1
hearer 1
with 1
consternation 1
and 1
make 1
fear 1
and 1
unnatural 1
horror 1
the 1
inmates 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
i 1
checked 1
therefore 1
my 1
impatient 1
thirst 1
for 1
sympathy 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
when 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
have 1
confided 1
the 1
fatal 1
secret 1
yet 1
still 1
words 1
like 1
those 1
i 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
burst 1
uncontrollably 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
offer 1
no 1
explanation 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
their 1
truth 1
in 1
part 1
relieved 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
my 1
mysterious 1
woe 1
upon 1
this 1
occasion 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
unbounded 1
wonder 1
my 1
dearest 1
victor 1
what 1
infatuation 1
is 1
this 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
never 1
to 1
make 1
such 1
an 1
assertion 1
again 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
mad 1
i 1
cried 1
energetically 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
the 1
heavens 1
who 1
have 1
viewed 1
my 1
operations 1
can 1
bear 1
witness 1
of 1
my 1
truth 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
assassin 1
of 1
those 1
most 1
innocent 1
victims 1
they 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
machinations 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
would 1
i 1
have 1
shed 1
my 1
own 1
blood 1
drop 1
by 1
drop 1
to 1
have 1
saved 1
their 1
lives 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sacrifice 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
this 1
speech 1
convinced 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
my 1
ideas 1
were 1
deranged 1
and 1
he 1
instantly 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
our 1
conversation 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
my 1
thoughts 1
he 1
wished 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
obliterate 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
scenes 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
ireland 1
and 1
never 1
alluded 1
to 1
them 1
or 1
suffered 1
me 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
as 1
time 1
passed 1
away 1
i 1
became 1
more 1
calm 1
misery 1
had 1
her 1
dwelling 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
i 1
no 1
longer 1
talked 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
incoherent 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
crimes 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
utmost 1
selfviolence 1
i 1
curbed 1
the 1
imperious 1
voice 1
of 1
wretchedness 1
which 1
sometimes 1
desired 1
to 1
declare 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
my 1
manners 1
were 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
composed 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
since 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
paris 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
switzerland 1
i 1
received 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
uncle 1
dated 1
at 1
paris 1
you 1
are 1
no 1
longer 1
at 1
a 1
formidable 1
distance 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
fortnight 1
my 1
poor 1
cousin 1
how 1
much 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
i 1
expect 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
looking 1
even 1
more 1
ill 1
than 1
when 1
you 1
quitted 1
geneva 1
this 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
passed 1
most 1
miserably 1
tortured 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
by 1
anxious 1
suspense 1
yet 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
peace 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
and 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
your 1
heart 1
is 1
not 1
totally 1
void 1
of 1
comfort 1
and 1
tranquillity 1
yet 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
now 1
exist 1
that 1
made 1
you 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
even 1
perhaps 1
augmented 1
by 1
time 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
disturb 1
you 1
at 1
this 1
period 1
when 1
so 1
many 1
misfortunes 1
weigh 1
upon 1
you 1
but 1
a 1
conversation 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
with 1
my 1
uncle 1
previous 1
to 1
his 1
departure 1
renders 1
some 1
explanation 1
necessary 1
before 1
we 1
meet 1
explanation 1
you 1
may 1
possibly 1
say 1
what 1
can 1
elizabeth 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
say 1
this 1
my 1
questions 1
are 1
answered 1
and 1
all 1
my 1
doubts 1
satisfied 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
distant 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
dread 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
pleased 1
with 1
this 1
explanation 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
probability 1
of 1
this 1
being 1
the 1
case 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
postpone 1
writing 1
what 1
during 1
your 1
absence 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
begin 1
you 1
well 1
know 1
victor 1
that 1
our 1
union 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
plan 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
our 1
infancy 1
we 1
were 1
told 1
this 1
when 1
young 1
and 1
taught 1
to 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
an 1
event 1
that 1
would 1
certainly 1
take 1
place 1
we 1
were 1
affectionate 1
playfellows 1
during 1
childhood 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
dear 1
and 1
valued 1
friends 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
as 1
we 1
grew 1
older 1
but 1
as 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
often 1
entertain 1
a 1
lively 1
affection 1
towards 1
each 1
other 1
without 1
desiring 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
union 1
may 1
not 1
such 1
also 1
be 1
our 1
case 1
tell 1
me 1
dearest 1
victor 1
answer 1
me 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
by 1
our 1
mutual 1
happiness 1
with 1
simple 1
truthdo 1
you 1
not 1
love 1
another 1
you 1
have 1
travelled 1
you 1
have 1
spent 1
several 1
years 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
and 1
i 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
autumn 1
so 1
unhappy 1
flying 1
to 1
solitude 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
every 1
creature 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
supposing 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
regret 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
believe 1
yourself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
fulfil 1
the 1
wishes 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
although 1
they 1
opposed 1
themselves 1
to 1
your 1
inclinations 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
false 1
reasoning 1
i 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
airy 1
dreams 1
of 1
futurity 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
constant 1
friend 1
and 1
companion 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
happiness 1
i 1
desire 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
i 1
declare 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
our 1
marriage 1
would 1
render 1
me 1
eternally 1
miserable 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
dictate 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
free 1
choice 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
weep 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
the 1
cruellest 1
misfortunes 1
you 1
may 1
stifle 1
by 1
the 1
word 1
honour 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
that 1
love 1
and 1
happiness 1
which 1
would 1
alone 1
restore 1
you 1
to 1
yourself 1
i 1
who 1
have 1
so 1
disinterested 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
you 1
may 1
increase 1
your 1
miseries 1
tenfold 1
by 1
being 1
an 1
obstacle 1
to 1
your 1
wishes 1
ah 1
victor 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
your 1
cousin 1
and 1
playmate 1
has 1
too 1
sincere 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
miserable 1
by 1
this 1
supposition 1
be 1
happy 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
obey 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
one 1
request 1
remain 1
satisfied 1
that 1
nothing 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
interrupt 1
my 1
tranquillity 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
this 1
letter 1
disturb 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
answer 1
tomorrow 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
even 1
until 1
you 1
come 1
if 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
pain 1
my 1
uncle 1
will 1
send 1
me 1
news 1
of 1
your 1
health 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
see 1
but 1
one 1
smile 1
on 1
your 1
lips 1
when 1
we 1
meet 1
occasioned 1
by 1
this 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
exertion 1
of 1
mine 1
i 1
shall 1

this 1
letter 1
revived 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
forgotten 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
the 1
fiendi 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
weddingnight 1
such 1
was 1
my 1
sentence 1
and 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
would 1
the 1
daemon 1
employ 1
every 1
art 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
glimpse 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
promised 1
partly 1
to 1
console 1
my 1
sufferings 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
consummate 1
his 1
crimes 1
by 1
my 1
death 1
well 1
be 1
it 1
so 1
a 1
deadly 1
struggle 1
would 1
then 1
assuredly 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
which 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
victorious 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
and 1
his 1
power 1
over 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
vanquished 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
alas 1
what 1
freedom 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
peasant 1
enjoys 1
when 1
his 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
massacred 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
his 1
cottage 1
burnt 1
his 1
lands 1
laid 1
waste 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
turned 1
adrift 1
homeless 1
penniless 1
and 1
alone 1
but 1
free 1
such 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
liberty 1
except 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
alas 1
balanced 1
by 1
those 1
horrors 1
of 1
remorse 1
and 1
guilt 1
which 1
would 1
pursue 1
me 1
until 1
death 1
sweet 1
and 1
beloved 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
reread 1
her 1
letter 1
and 1
some 1
softened 1
feelings 1
stole 1
into 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
whisper 1
paradisiacal 1
dreams 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
joy 1
but 1
the 1
apple 1
was 1
already 1
eaten 1
and 1
the 1
angels 1
arm 1
bared 1
to 1
drive 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
hope 1
yet 1
i 1
would 1
die 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
happy 1
if 1
the 1
monster 1
executed 1
his 1
threat 1
death 1
was 1
inevitable 1
yet 1
again 1
i 1
considered 1
whether 1
my 1
marriage 1
would 1
hasten 1
my 1
fate 1
my 1
destruction 1
might 1
indeed 1
arrive 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
sooner 1
but 1
if 1
my 1
torturer 1
should 1
suspect 1
that 1
i 1
postponed 1
it 1
influenced 1
by 1
his 1
menaces 1
he 1
would 1
surely 1
find 1
other 1
and 1
perhaps 1
more 1
dreadful 1
means 1
of 1
revenge 1
he 1
had 1
vowed 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
my 1
weddingnight 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
consider 1
that 1
threat 1
as 1
binding 1
him 1
to 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
for 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
satiated 1
with 1
blood 1
he 1
had 1
murdered 1
clerval 1
immediately 1
after 1
the 1
enunciation 1
of 1
his 1
threats 1
i 1
resolved 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
conduce 1
either 1
to 1
hers 1
or 1
my 1
fathers 1
happiness 1
my 1
adversarys 1
designs 1
against 1
my 1
life 1
should 1
not 1
retard 1
it 1
a 1
single 1
hour 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
wrote 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
letter 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
affectionate 1
i 1
fear 1
my 1
beloved 1
girl 1
i 1
said 1
little 1
happiness 1
remains 1
for 1
us 1
on 1
earth 1
yet 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
one 1
day 1
enjoy 1
is 1
centred 1
in 1
you 1
chase 1
away 1
your 1
idle 1
fears 1
to 1
you 1
alone 1
do 1
i 1
consecrate 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
my 1
endeavours 1
for 1
contentment 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
secret 1
elizabeth 1
a 1
dreadful 1
one 1
when 1
revealed 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
chill 1
your 1
frame 1
with 1
horror 1
and 1
then 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
i 1
survive 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
i 1
will 1
confide 1
this 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
terror 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
our 1
marriage 1
shall 1
take 1
place 1
for 1
my 1
sweet 1
cousin 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
perfect 1
confidence 1
between 1
us 1
but 1
until 1
then 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
mention 1
or 1
allude 1
to 1
it 1
this 1
i 1
most 1
earnestly 1
entreat 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
after 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
elizabeths 1
letter 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
geneva 1
the 1
sweet 1
girl 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
warm 1
affection 1
yet 1
tears 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
as 1
she 1
beheld 1
my 1
emaciated 1
frame 1
and 1
feverish 1
cheeks 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
also 1
she 1
was 1
thinner 1
and 1
had 1
lost 1
much 1
of 1
that 1
heavenly 1
vivacity 1
that 1
had 1
before 1
charmed 1
me 1
but 1
her 1
gentleness 1
and 1
soft 1
looks 1
of 1
compassion 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
more 1
fit 1
companion 1
for 1
one 1
blasted 1
and 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
enjoyed 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
memory 1
brought 1
madness 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
real 1
insanity 1
possessed 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
was 1
furious 1
and 1
burnt 1
with 1
rage 1
sometimes 1
low 1
and 1
despondent 1
i 1
neither 1
spoke 1
nor 1
looked 1
at 1
anyone 1
but 1
sat 1
motionless 1
bewildered 1
by 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
miseries 1
that 1
overcame 1
me 1
elizabeth 1
alone 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
draw 1
me 1
from 1
these 1
fits 1
her 1
gentle 1
voice 1
would 1
soothe 1
me 1
when 1
transported 1
by 1
passion 1
and 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
human 1
feelings 1
when 1
sunk 1
in 1
torpor 1
she 1
wept 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
reason 1
returned 1
she 1
would 1
remonstrate 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
resignation 1
ah 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
to 1
be 1
resigned 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
guilty 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
peace 1
the 1
agonies 1
of 1
remorse 1
poison 1
the 1
luxury 1
there 1
is 1
otherwise 1
sometimes 1
found 1
in 1
indulging 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
grief 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
my 1
father 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
immediate 1
marriage 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
remained 1
silent 1
have 1
you 1
then 1
some 1
other 1
attachment 1
none 1
on 1
earth 1
i 1
love 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
delight 1
let 1
the 1
day 1
therefore 1
be 1
fixed 1
and 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
consecrate 1
myself 1
in 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
do 1
not 1
speak 1
thus 1
heavy 1
misfortunes 1
have 1
befallen 1
us 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
only 1
cling 1
closer 1
to 1
what 1
remains 1
and 1
transfer 1
our 1
love 1
for 1
those 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
yet 1
live 1
our 1
circle 1
will 1
be 1
small 1
but 1
bound 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
ties 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
mutual 1
misfortune 1
and 1
when 1
time 1
shall 1
have 1
softened 1
your 1
despair 1
new 1
and 1
dear 1
objects 1
of 1
care 1
will 1
be 1
born 1
to 1
replace 1
those 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
cruelly 1
deprived 1
such 1
were 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
returned 1
nor 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
omnipotent 1
as 1
the 1
fiend 1
had 1
yet 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
deeds 1
of 1
blood 1
i 1
should 1
almost 1
regard 1
him 1
as 1
invincible 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
pronounced 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
weddingnight 1
i 1
should 1
regard 1
the 1
threatened 1
fate 1
as 1
unavoidable 1
but 1
death 1
was 1
no 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
were 1
balanced 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
therefore 1
with 1
a 1
contented 1
and 1
even 1
cheerful 1
countenance 1
agreed 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
consent 1
the 1
ceremony 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
ten 1
days 1
and 1
thus 1
put 1
as 1
i 1
imagined 1
the 1
seal 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
great 1
god 1
if 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
i 1
had 1
thought 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
hellish 1
intention 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
adversary 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
banished 1
myself 1
forever 1
from 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
wandered 1
a 1
friendless 1
outcast 1
over 1
the 1
earth 1
than 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
this 1
miserable 1
marriage 1
but 1
as 1
if 1
possessed 1
of 1
magic 1
powers 1
the 1
monster 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
his 1
real 1
intentions 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
prepared 1
only 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
i 1
hastened 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
far 1
dearer 1
victim 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
our 1
marriage 1
drew 1
nearer 1
whether 1
from 1
cowardice 1
or 1
a 1
prophetic 1
feeling 1
i 1
felt 1
my 1
heart 1
sink 1
within 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
concealed 1
my 1
feelings 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
hilarity 1
that 1
brought 1
smiles 1
and 1
joy 1
to 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
hardly 1
deceived 1
the 1
everwatchful 1
and 1
nicer 1
eye 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
placid 1
contentment 1
not 1
unmingled 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
fear 1
which 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
had 1
impressed 1
that 1
what 1
now 1
appeared 1
certain 1
and 1
tangible 1
happiness 1
might 1
soon 1
dissipate 1
into 1
an 1
airy 1
dream 1
and 1
leave 1
no 1
trace 1
but 1
deep 1
and 1
everlasting 1
regret 1
preparations 1
were 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
event 1
congratulatory 1
visits 1
were 1
received 1
and 1
all 1
wore 1
a 1
smiling 1
appearance 1
i 1
shut 1
up 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
the 1
anxiety 1
that 1
preyed 1
there 1
and 1
entered 1
with 1
seeming 1
earnestness 1
into 1
the 1
plans 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
although 1
they 1
might 1
only 1
serve 1
as 1
the 1
decorations 1
of 1
my 1
tragedy 1
through 1
my 1
fathers 1
exertions 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
inheritance 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
had 1
been 1
restored 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
austrian 1
government 1
a 1
small 1
possession 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
como 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
immediately 1
after 1
our 1
union 1
we 1
should 1
proceed 1
to 1
villa 1
lavenza 1
and 1
spend 1
our 1
first 1
days 1
of 1
happiness 1
beside 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
near 1
which 1
it 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
took 1
every 1
precaution 1
to 1
defend 1
my 1
person 1
in 1
case 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
openly 1
attack 1
me 1
i 1
carried 1
pistols 1
and 1
a 1
dagger 1
constantly 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
ever 1
on 1
the 1
watch 1
to 1
prevent 1
artifice 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
gained 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
indeed 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
approached 1
the 1
threat 1
appeared 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
delusion 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
worthy 1
to 1
disturb 1
my 1
peace 1
while 1
the 1
happiness 1
i 1
hoped 1
for 1
in 1
my 1
marriage 1
wore 1
a 1
greater 1
appearance 1
of 1
certainty 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
fixed 1
for 1
its 1
solemnization 1
drew 1
nearer 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
continually 1
spoken 1
of 1
as 1
an 1
occurrence 1
which 1
no 1
accident 1
could 1
possibly 1
prevent 1
elizabeth 1
seemed 1
happy 1
my 1
tranquil 1
demeanour 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
calm 1
her 1
mind 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
wishes 1
and 1
my 1
destiny 1
she 1
was 1
melancholy 1
and 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
evil 1
pervaded 1
her 1
and 1
perhaps 1
also 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
reveal 1
to 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
overjoyed 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bustle 1
of 1
preparation 1
only 1
recognized 1
in 1
the 1
melancholy 1
of 1
his 1
niece 1
the 1
diffidence 1
of 1
a 1
bride 1
after 1
the 1
ceremony 1
was 1
performed 1
a 1
large 1
party 1
assembled 1
at 1
my 1
fathers 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
by 1
water 1
sleeping 1
that 1
night 1
at 1
evian 1
and 1
continuing 1
our 1
voyage 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
fair 1
the 1
wind 1
favourable 1
all 1
smiled 1
on 1
our 1
nuptial 1
embarkation 1
those 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
feeling 1
of 1
happiness 1
we 1
passed 1
rapidly 1
along 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
hot 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
sheltered 1
from 1
its 1
rays 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
canopy 1
while 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
sometimes 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
where 1
we 1
saw 1
mont 1
saleve 1
the 1
pleasant 1
banks 1
of 1
montalegre 1
and 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
surmounting 1
all 1
the 1
beautiful 1
mont 1
blanc 1
and 1
the 1
assemblage 1
of 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
that 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
emulate 1
her 1
sometimes 1
coasting 1
the 1
opposite 1
banks 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
mighty 1
jura 1
opposing 1
its 1
dark 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
ambition 1
that 1
would 1
quit 1
its 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
an 1
almost 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
to 1
the 1
invader 1
who 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
enslave 1
it 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
you 1
are 1
sorrowful 1
my 1
love 1
ah 1
if 1
you 1
knew 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
suffered 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
may 1
yet 1
endure 1
you 1
would 1
endeavour 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
taste 1
the 1
quiet 1
and 1
freedom 1
from 1
despair 1
that 1
this 1
one 1
day 1
at 1
least 1
permits 1
me 1
to 1
enjoy 1
be 1
happy 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
replied 1
elizabeth 1
there 1
is 1
i 1
hope 1
nothing 1
to 1
distress 1
you 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
lively 1
joy 1
is 1
not 1
painted 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
contented 1
something 1
whispers 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
to 1
depend 1
too 1
much 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
that 1
is 1
opened 1
before 1
us 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
sinister 1
voice 1
observe 1
how 1
fast 1
we 1
move 1
along 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
clouds 1
which 1
sometimes 1
obscure 1
and 1
sometimes 1
rise 1
above 1
the 1
dome 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
render 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
beauty 1
still 1
more 1
interesting 1
look 1
also 1
at 1
the 1
innumerable 1
fish 1
that 1
are 1
swimming 1
in 1
the 1
clear 1
waters 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
distinguish 1
every 1
pebble 1
that 1
lies 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
what 1
a 1
divine 1
day 1
how 1
happy 1
and 1
serene 1
all 1
nature 1
appears 1
thus 1
elizabeth 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
divert 1
her 1
thoughts 1
and 1
mine 1
from 1
all 1
reflection 1
upon 1
melancholy 1
subjects 1
but 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
fluctuating 1
joy 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
instants 1
shone 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
but 1
it 1
continually 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
distraction 1
and 1
reverie 1
the 1
sun 1
sank 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
we 1
passed 1
the 1
river 1
drance 1
and 1
observed 1
its 1
path 1
through 1
the 1
chasms 1
of 1
the 1
higher 1
and 1
the 1
glens 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
hills 1
the 1
alps 1
here 1
come 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
amphitheatre 1
of 1
mountains 1
which 1
forms 1
its 1
eastern 1
boundary 1
the 1
spire 1
of 1
evian 1
shone 1
under 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
mountain 1
above 1
mountain 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
overhung 1
the 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
carried 1
us 1
along 1
with 1
amazing 1
rapidity 1
sank 1
at 1
sunset 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
breeze 1
the 1
soft 1
air 1
just 1
ruffled 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
caused 1
a 1
pleasant 1
motion 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
shore 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
wafted 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
scent 1
of 1
flowers 1
and 1
hay 1
the 1
sun 1
sank 1
beneath 1
the 1
horizon 1
as 1
we 1
landed 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
touched 1
the 1
shore 1
i 1
felt 1
those 1
cares 1
and 1
fears 1
revive 1
which 1
soon 1
were 1
to 1
clasp 1
me 1
and 1
cling 1
to 1
me 1
forever 1
chapter 1
23 1
it 1
was 1
eight 1
oclock 1
when 1
we 1
landed 1
we 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
enjoying 1
the 1
transitory 1
light 1
and 1
then 1
retired 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lovely 1
scene 1
of 1
waters 1
woods 1
and 1
mountains 1
obscured 1
in 1
darkness 1
yet 1
still 1
displaying 1
their 1
black 1
outlines 1
the 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
south 1
now 1
rose 1
with 1
great 1
violence 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
reached 1
her 1
summit 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
clouds 1
swept 1
across 1
it 1
swifter 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
the 1
vulture 1
and 1
dimmed 1
her 1
rays 1
while 1
the 1
lake 1
reflected 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
busy 1
heavens 1
rendered 1
still 1
busier 1
by 1
the 1
restless 1
waves 1
that 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
rise 1
suddenly 1
a 1
heavy 1
storm 1
of 1
rain 1
descended 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
calm 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
but 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
night 1
obscured 1
the 1
shapes 1
of 1
objects 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
arose 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
anxious 1
and 1
watchful 1
while 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
grasped 1
a 1
pistol 1
which 1
was 1
hidden 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
every 1
sound 1
terrified 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
resolved 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
sell 1
my 1
life 1
dearly 1
and 1
not 1
shrink 1
from 1
the 1
conflict 1
until 1
my 1
own 1
life 1
or 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1
was 1
extinguished 1
elizabeth 1
observed 1
my 1
agitation 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
timid 1
and 1
fearful 1
silence 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
my 1
glance 1
which 1
communicated 1
terror 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
trembling 1
she 1
asked 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
agitates 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
fear 1
oh 1
peace 1
peace 1
my 1
love 1
replied 1
i 1
this 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
but 1
this 1
night 1
is 1
dreadful 1
very 1
dreadful 1
i 1
passed 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
reflected 1
how 1
fearful 1
the 1
combat 1
which 1
i 1
momentarily 1
expected 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
i 1
earnestly 1
entreated 1
her 1
to 1
retire 1
resolving 1
not 1
to 1
join 1
her 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
some 1
knowledge 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
situation 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
she 1
left 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
some 1
time 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
passages 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
inspecting 1
every 1
corner 1
that 1
might 1
afford 1
a 1
retreat 1
to 1
my 1
adversary 1
but 1
i 1
discovered 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
conjecture 1
that 1
some 1
fortunate 1
chance 1
had 1
intervened 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
menaces 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
shrill 1
and 1
dreadful 1
scream 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
into 1
which 1
elizabeth 1
had 1
retired 1
as 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
rushed 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
my 1
arms 1
dropped 1
the 1
motion 1
of 1
every 1
muscle 1
and 1
fibre 1
was 1
suspended 1
i 1
could 1
feel 1
the 1
blood 1
trickling 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
and 1
tingling 1
in 1
the 1
extremities 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
this 1
state 1
lasted 1
but 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
scream 1
was 1
repeated 1
and 1
i 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
great 1
god 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
then 1
expire 1
why 1
am 1
i 1
here 1
to 1
relate 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
purest 1
creature 1
on 1
earth 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
lifeless 1
and 1
inanimate 1
thrown 1
across 1
the 1
bed 1
her 1
head 1
hanging 1
down 1
and 1
her 1
pale 1
and 1
distorted 1
features 1
half 1
covered 1
by 1
her 1
hair 1
everywhere 1
i 1
turn 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
same 1
figureher 1
bloodless 1
arms 1
and 1
relaxed 1
form 1
flung 1
by 1
the 1
murderer 1
on 1
its 1
bridal 1
bier 1
could 1
i 1
behold 1
this 1
and 1
live 1
alas 1
life 1
is 1
obstinate 1
and 1
clings 1
closest 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
hated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
only 1
did 1
i 1
lose 1
recollection 1
i 1
fell 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
when 1
i 1
recovered 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
surrounded 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
inn 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
a 1
breathless 1
terror 1
but 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
others 1
appeared 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
mockery 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
feelings 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
i 1
escaped 1
from 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
love 1
my 1
wife 1
so 1
lately 1
living 1
so 1
dear 1
so 1
worthy 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
moved 1
from 1
the 1
posture 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
beheld 1
her 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
she 1
lay 1
her 1
head 1
upon 1
her 1
arm 1
and 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
thrown 1
across 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
neck 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
supposed 1
her 1
asleep 1
i 1
rushed 1
towards 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
with 1
ardour 1
but 1
the 1
deadly 1
languor 1
and 1
coldness 1
of 1
the 1
limbs 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
i 1
now 1
held 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
elizabeth 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
loved 1
and 1
cherished 1
the 1
murderous 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fiends 1
grasp 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
issue 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
while 1
i 1
still 1
hung 1
over 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
darkened 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
panic 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
pale 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
illuminate 1
the 1
chamber 1
the 1
shutters 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
back 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
horror 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
i 1
saw 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
a 1
figure 1
the 1
most 1
hideous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
a 1
grin 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
jeer 1
as 1
with 1
his 1
fiendish 1
finger 1
he 1
pointed 1
towards 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
i 1
rushed 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
drawing 1
a 1
pistol 1
from 1
my 1
bosom 1
fired 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
leaped 1
from 1
his 1
station 1
and 1
running 1
with 1
the 1
swiftness 1
of 1
lightning 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
pistol 1
brought 1
a 1
crowd 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
i 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
we 1
followed 1
the 1
track 1
with 1
boats 1
nets 1
were 1
cast 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
after 1
passing 1
several 1
hours 1
we 1
returned 1
hopeless 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
companions 1
believing 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
form 1
conjured 1
up 1
by 1
my 1
fancy 1
after 1
having 1
landed 1
they 1
proceeded 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
country 1
parties 1
going 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
among 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
vines 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
accompany 1
them 1
and 1
proceeded 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
head 1
whirled 1
round 1
my 1
steps 1
were 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
drunken 1
man 1
i 1
fell 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
film 1
covered 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
skin 1
was 1
parched 1
with 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
fever 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
back 1
and 1
placed 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
my 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
seek 1
something 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
lost 1
after 1
an 1
interval 1
i 1
arose 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
by 1
instinct 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
lay 1
there 1
were 1
women 1
weeping 1
around 1
i 1
hung 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
joined 1
my 1
sad 1
tears 1
to 1
theirs 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
no 1
distinct 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
but 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rambled 1
to 1
various 1
subjects 1
reflecting 1
confusedly 1
on 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
and 1
their 1
cause 1
i 1
was 1
bewildered 1
in 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
horror 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
william 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
justine 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
clerval 1
and 1
lastly 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
even 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
that 1
my 1
only 1
remaining 1
friends 1
were 1
safe 1
from 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
my 1
father 1
even 1
now 1
might 1
be 1
writhing 1
under 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
ernest 1
might 1
be 1
dead 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
this 1
idea 1
made 1
me 1
shudder 1
and 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
action 1
i 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
with 1
all 1
possible 1
speed 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
horses 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
unfavourable 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
fell 1
in 1
torrents 1
however 1
it 1
was 1
hardly 1
morning 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
reasonably 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
by 1
night 1
i 1
hired 1
men 1
to 1
row 1
and 1
took 1
an 1
oar 1
myself 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
experienced 1
relief 1
from 1
mental 1
torment 1
in 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
but 1
the 1
overflowing 1
misery 1
i 1
now 1
felt 1
and 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
that 1
i 1
endured 1
rendered 1
me 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
i 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
oar 1
and 1
leaning 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
hands 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
every 1
gloomy 1
idea 1
that 1
arose 1
if 1
i 1
looked 1
up 1
i 1
saw 1
scenes 1
which 1
were 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
happier 1
time 1
and 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
contemplated 1
but 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
her 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
but 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
a 1
recollection 1
tears 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
rain 1
had 1
ceased 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
fish 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
waters 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
then 1
been 1
observed 1
by 1
elizabeth 1
nothing 1
is 1
so 1
painful 1
to 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
sudden 1
change 1
the 1
sun 1
might 1
shine 1
or 1
the 1
clouds 1
might 1
lower 1
but 1
nothing 1
could 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
a 1
fiend 1
had 1
snatched 1
from 1
me 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
no 1
creature 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
frightful 1
an 1
event 1
is 1
single 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
man 1
but 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
dwell 1
upon 1
the 1
incidents 1
that 1
followed 1
this 1
last 1
overwhelming 1
event 1
mine 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
horrors 1
i 1
have 1
reached 1
their 1
acme 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
must 1
now 1
relate 1
can 1
but 1
be 1
tedious 1
to 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
snatched 1
away 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
desolate 1
my 1
own 1
strength 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
tell 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
what 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
narration 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
geneva 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
ernest 1
yet 1
lived 1
but 1
the 1
former 1
sunk 1
under 1
the 1
tidings 1
that 1
i 1
bore 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
excellent 1
and 1
venerable 1
old 1
man 1
his 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
in 1
vacancy 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
their 1
charm 1
and 1
their 1
delighthis 1
elizabeth 1
his 1
more 1
than 1
daughter 1
whom 1
he 1
doted 1
on 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
affection 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
feels 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
having 1
few 1
affections 1
clings 1
more 1
earnestly 1
to 1
those 1
that 1
remain 1
cursed 1
cursed 1
be 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
brought 1
misery 1
on 1
his 1
grey 1
hairs 1
and 1
doomed 1
him 1
to 1
waste 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
under 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
were 1
accumulated 1
around 1
him 1
the 1
springs 1
of 1
existence 1
suddenly 1
gave 1
way 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rise 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
what 1
then 1
became 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
i 1
lost 1
sensation 1
and 1
chains 1
and 1
darkness 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
objects 1
that 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
i 1
dreamt 1
that 1
i 1
wandered 1
in 1
flowery 1
meadows 1
and 1
pleasant 1
vales 1
with 1
the 1
friends 1
of 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
dungeon 1
melancholy 1
followed 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
gained 1
a 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
my 1
miseries 1
and 1
situation 1
and 1
was 1
then 1
released 1
from 1
my 1
prison 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
called 1
me 1
mad 1
and 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
a 1
solitary 1
cell 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
habitation 1
liberty 1
however 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
useless 1
gift 1
to 1
me 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
as 1
i 1
awakened 1
to 1
reason 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
awakened 1
to 1
revenge 1
as 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
their 1
causethe 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
the 1
miserable 1
daemon 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
sent 1
abroad 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
i 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
maddening 1
rage 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
desired 1
and 1
ardently 1
prayed 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
him 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
to 1
wreak 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
signal 1
revenge 1
on 1
his 1
cursed 1
head 1
nor 1
did 1
my 1
hate 1
long 1
confine 1
itself 1
to 1
useless 1
wishes 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
best 1
means 1
of 1
securing 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
after 1
my 1
release 1
i 1
repaired 1
to 1
a 1
criminal 1
judge 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
accusation 1
to 1
make 1
that 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
destroyer 1
of 1
my 1
family 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
required 1
him 1
to 1
exert 1
his 1
whole 1
authority 1
for 1
the 1
apprehension 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
the 1
magistrate 1
listened 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
attention 1
and 1
kindness 1
be 1
assured 1
sir 1
said 1
he 1
no 1
pains 1
or 1
exertions 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
shall 1
be 1
spared 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
villain 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
replied 1
i 1
listen 1
therefore 1
to 1
the 1
deposition 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
tale 1
so 1
strange 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
fear 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
were 1
there 1
not 1
something 1
in 1
truth 1
which 1
however 1
wonderful 1
forces 1
conviction 1
the 1
story 1
is 1
too 1
connected 1
to 1
be 1
mistaken 1
for 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
motive 1
for 1
falsehood 1
my 1
manner 1
as 1
i 1
thus 1
addressed 1
him 1
was 1
impressive 1
but 1
calm 1
i 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
destroyer 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
this 1
purpose 1
quieted 1
my 1
agony 1
and 1
for 1
an 1
interval 1
reconciled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
i 1
now 1
related 1
my 1
history 1
briefly 1
but 1
with 1
firmness 1
and 1
precision 1
marking 1
the 1
dates 1
with 1
accuracy 1
and 1
never 1
deviating 1
into 1
invective 1
or 1
exclamation 1
the 1
magistrate 1
appeared 1
at 1
first 1
perfectly 1
incredulous 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
continued 1
he 1
became 1
more 1
attentive 1
and 1
interested 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
sometimes 1
shudder 1
with 1
horror 1
at 1
others 1
a 1
lively 1
surprise 1
unmingled 1
with 1
disbelief 1
was 1
painted 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
concluded 1
my 1
narration 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
accuse 1
and 1
for 1
whose 1
seizure 1
and 1
punishment 1
i 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
to 1
exert 1
your 1
whole 1
power 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
duty 1
as 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
and 1
hope 1
that 1
your 1
feelings 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
revolt 1
from 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
those 1
functions 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
this 1
address 1
caused 1
a 1
considerable 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
physiognomy 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
auditor 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
with 1
that 1
half 1
kind 1
of 1
belief 1
that 1
is 1
given 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
spirits 1
and 1
supernatural 1
events 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
act 1
officially 1
in 1
consequence 1
the 1
whole 1
tide 1
of 1
his 1
incredulity 1
returned 1
he 1
however 1
answered 1
mildly 1
i 1
would 1
willingly 1
afford 1
you 1
every 1
aid 1
in 1
your 1
pursuit 1
but 1
the 1
creature 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
speak 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
powers 1
which 1
would 1
put 1
all 1
my 1
exertions 1
to 1
defiance 1
who 1
can 1
follow 1
an 1
animal 1
which 1
can 1
traverse 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
and 1
inhabit 1
caves 1
and 1
dens 1
where 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
intrude 1
besides 1
some 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conjecture 1
to 1
what 1
place 1
he 1
has 1
wandered 1
or 1
what 1
region 1
he 1
may 1
now 1
inhabit 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
hovers 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
which 1
i 1
inhabit 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
indeed 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
alps 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
hunted 1
like 1
the 1
chamois 1
and 1
destroyed 1
as 1
a 1
beast 1
of 1
prey 1
but 1
i 1
perceive 1
your 1
thoughts 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
credit 1
my 1
narrative 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
with 1
the 1
punishment 1
which 1
is 1
his 1
desert 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
rage 1
sparkled 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
magistrate 1
was 1
intimidated 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
exert 1
myself 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
monster 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
suffer 1
punishment 1
proportionate 1
to 1
his 1
crimes 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
described 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
properties 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
impracticable 1
and 1
thus 1
while 1
every 1
proper 1
measure 1
is 1
pursued 1
you 1
should 1
make 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
to 1
disappointment 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
little 1
avail 1
my 1
revenge 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
moment 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
while 1
i 1
allow 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
vice 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
devouring 1
and 1
only 1
passion 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
my 1
rage 1
is 1
unspeakable 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
turned 1
loose 1
upon 1
society 1
still 1
exists 1
you 1
refuse 1
my 1
just 1
demand 1
i 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
resource 1
and 1
i 1
devote 1
myself 1
either 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
his 1
destruction 1
i 1
trembled 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
frenzy 1
in 1
my 1
manner 1
and 1
something 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
of 1
that 1
haughty 1
fierceness 1
which 1
the 1
martyrs 1
of 1
old 1
are 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
but 1
to 1
a 1
genevan 1
magistrate 1
whose 1
mind 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
far 1
other 1
ideas 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
devotion 1
and 1
heroism 1
this 1
elevation 1
of 1
mind 1
had 1
much 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
madness 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
soothe 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
nurse 1
does 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
reverted 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
as 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
delirium 1
man 1
i 1
cried 1
how 1
ignorant 1
art 1
thou 1
in 1
thy 1
pride 1
of 1
wisdom 1
cease 1
you 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
say 1
i 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
angry 1
and 1
disturbed 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
meditate 1
on 1
some 1
other 1
mode 1
of 1
action 1
chapter 1
24 1
my 1
present 1
situation 1
was 1
one 1
in 1
which 1
all 1
voluntary 1
thought 1
was 1
swallowed 1
up 1
and 1
lost 1
i 1
was 1
hurried 1
away 1
by 1
fury 1
revenge 1
alone 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
strength 1
and 1
composure 1
it 1
moulded 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
calculating 1
and 1
calm 1
at 1
periods 1
when 1
otherwise 1
delirium 1
or 1
death 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
portion 1
my 1
first 1
resolution 1
was 1
to 1
quit 1
geneva 1
forever 1
my 1
country 1
which 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
in 1
my 1
adversity 1
became 1
hateful 1
i 1
provided 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
which 1
had 1
belonged 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
departed 1
and 1
now 1
my 1
wanderings 1
began 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
cease 1
but 1
with 1
life 1
i 1
have 1
traversed 1
a 1
vast 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
have 1
endured 1
all 1
the 1
hardships 1
which 1
travellers 1
in 1
deserts 1
and 1
barbarous 1
countries 1
are 1
wont 1
to 1
meet 1
how 1
i 1
have 1
lived 1
i 1
hardly 1
know 1
many 1
times 1
have 1
i 1
stretched 1
my 1
failing 1
limbs 1
upon 1
the 1
sandy 1
plain 1
and 1
prayed 1
for 1
death 1
but 1
revenge 1
kept 1
me 1
alive 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
die 1
and 1
leave 1
my 1
adversary 1
in 1
being 1
when 1
i 1
quitted 1
geneva 1
my 1
first 1
labour 1
was 1
to 1
gain 1
some 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
trace 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
enemy 1
but 1
my 1
plan 1
was 1
unsettled 1
and 1
i 1
wandered 1
many 1
hours 1
round 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
uncertain 1
what 1
path 1
i 1
should 1
pursue 1
as 1
night 1
approached 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
cemetery 1
where 1
william 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
reposed 1
i 1
entered 1
it 1
and 1
approached 1
the 1
tomb 1
which 1
marked 1
their 1
graves 1
everything 1
was 1
silent 1
except 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
which 1
were 1
gently 1
agitated 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
nearly 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
solemn 1
and 1
affecting 1
even 1
to 1
an 1
uninterested 1
observer 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
departed 1
seemed 1
to 1
flit 1
around 1
and 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
shadow 1
which 1
was 1
felt 1
but 1
not 1
seen 1
around 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
mourner 1
the 1
deep 1
grief 1
which 1
this 1
scene 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
excited 1
quickly 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
rage 1
and 1
despair 1
they 1
were 1
dead 1
and 1
i 1
lived 1
their 1
murderer 1
also 1
lived 1
and 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
i 1
must 1
drag 1
out 1
my 1
weary 1
existence 1
i 1
knelt 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
with 1
quivering 1
lips 1
exclaimed 1
by 1
the 1
sacred 1
earth 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
kneel 1
by 1
the 1
shades 1
that 1
wander 1
near 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
eternal 1
grief 1
that 1
i 1
feel 1
i 1
swear 1
and 1
by 1
thee 1
o 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
preside 1
over 1
thee 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
daemon 1
who 1
caused 1
this 1
misery 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
perish 1
in 1
mortal 1
conflict 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
i 1
will 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
execute 1
this 1
dear 1
revenge 1
will 1
i 1
again 1
behold 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
tread 1
the 1
green 1
herbage 1
of 1
earth 1
which 1
otherwise 1
should 1
vanish 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
forever 1
and 1
i 1
call 1
on 1
you 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
on 1
you 1
wandering 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
to 1
aid 1
and 1
conduct 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
work 1
let 1
the 1
cursed 1
and 1
hellish 1
monster 1
drink 1
deep 1
of 1
agony 1
let 1
him 1
feel 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
now 1
torments 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
my 1
adjuration 1
with 1
solemnity 1
and 1
an 1
awe 1
which 1
almost 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
shades 1
of 1
my 1
murdered 1
friends 1
heard 1
and 1
approved 1
my 1
devotion 1
but 1
the 1
furies 1
possessed 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
concluded 1
and 1
rage 1
choked 1
my 1
utterance 1
i 1
was 1
answered 1
through 1
the 1
stillness 1
of 1
night 1
by 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
fiendish 1
laugh 1
it 1
rang 1
on 1
my 1
ears 1
long 1
and 1
heavily 1
the 1
mountains 1
reechoed 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
all 1
hell 1
surrounded 1
me 1
with 1
mockery 1
and 1
laughter 1
surely 1
in 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
possessed 1
by 1
frenzy 1
and 1
have 1
destroyed 1
my 1
miserable 1
existence 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
vow 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
reserved 1
for 1
vengeance 1
the 1
laughter 1
died 1
away 1
when 1
a 1
wellknown 1
and 1
abhorred 1
voice 1
apparently 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
ear 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
whisper 1
i 1
am 1
satisfied 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
you 1
have 1
determined 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
satisfied 1
i 1
darted 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
sound 1
proceeded 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
eluded 1
my 1
grasp 1
suddenly 1
the 1
broad 1
disk 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
arose 1
and 1
shone 1
full 1
upon 1
his 1
ghastly 1
and 1
distorted 1
shape 1
as 1
he 1
fled 1
with 1
more 1
than 1
mortal 1
speed 1
i 1
pursued 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
this 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
task 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
slight 1
clue 1
i 1
followed 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
rhone 1
but 1
vainly 1
the 1
blue 1
mediterranean 1
appeared 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
strange 1
chance 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
fiend 1
enter 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
the 1
black 1
sea 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
passage 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
ship 1
but 1
he 1
escaped 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
amidst 1
the 1
wilds 1
of 1
tartary 1
and 1
russia 1
although 1
he 1
still 1
evaded 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
followed 1
in 1
his 1
track 1
sometimes 1
the 1
peasants 1
scared 1
by 1
this 1
horrid 1
apparition 1
informed 1
me 1
of 1
his 1
path 1
sometimes 1
he 1
himself 1
who 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
i 1
should 1
despair 1
and 1
die 1
left 1
some 1
mark 1
to 1
guide 1
me 1
the 1
snows 1
descended 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
his 1
huge 1
step 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
plain 1
to 1
you 1
first 1
entering 1
on 1
life 1
to 1
whom 1
care 1
is 1
new 1
and 1
agony 1
unknown 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
still 1
feel 1
cold 1
want 1
and 1
fatigue 1
were 1
the 1
least 1
pains 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
i 1
was 1
cursed 1
by 1
some 1
devil 1
and 1
carried 1
about 1
with 1
me 1
my 1
eternal 1
hell 1
yet 1
still 1
a 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
followed 1
and 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
most 1
murmured 1
would 1
suddenly 1
extricate 1
me 1
from 1
seemingly 1
insurmountable 1
difficulties 1
sometimes 1
when 1
nature 1
overcome 1
by 1
hunger 1
sank 1
under 1
the 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
repast 1
was 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
desert 1
that 1
restored 1
and 1
inspirited 1
me 1
the 1
fare 1
was 1
indeed 1
coarse 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
peasants 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
ate 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
set 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
invoked 1
to 1
aid 1
me 1
often 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
dry 1
the 1
heavens 1
cloudless 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
parched 1
by 1
thirst 1
a 1
slight 1
cloud 1
would 1
bedim 1
the 1
sky 1
shed 1
the 1
few 1
drops 1
that 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
vanish 1
i 1
followed 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
the 1
courses 1
of 1
the 1
rivers 1
but 1
the 1
daemon 1
generally 1
avoided 1
these 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
the 1
population 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
chiefly 1
collected 1
in 1
other 1
places 1
human 1
beings 1
were 1
seldom 1
seen 1
and 1
i 1
generally 1
subsisted 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
that 1
crossed 1
my 1
path 1
i 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
gained 1
the 1
friendship 1
of 1
the 1
villagers 1
by 1
distributing 1
it 1
or 1
i 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
some 1
food 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
killed 1
which 1
after 1
taking 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
i 1
always 1
presented 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
me 1
with 1
fire 1
and 1
utensils 1
for 1
cooking 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
thus 1
was 1
indeed 1
hateful 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
sleep 1
alone 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
taste 1
joy 1
o 1
blessed 1
sleep 1
often 1
when 1
most 1
miserable 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
repose 1
and 1
my 1
dreams 1
lulled 1
me 1
even 1
to 1
rapture 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
guarded 1
me 1
had 1
provided 1
these 1
moments 1
or 1
rather 1
hours 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
retain 1
strength 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
deprived 1
of 1
this 1
respite 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
hardships 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
sustained 1
and 1
inspirited 1
by 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
night 1
for 1
in 1
sleep 1
i 1
saw 1
my 1
friends 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
again 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
heard 1
the 1
silver 1
tones 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeths 1
voice 1
and 1
beheld 1
clerval 1
enjoying 1
health 1
and 1
youth 1
often 1
when 1
wearied 1
by 1
a 1
toilsome 1
march 1
i 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
dreaming 1
until 1
night 1
should 1
come 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
then 1
enjoy 1
reality 1
in 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
my 1
dearest 1
friends 1
what 1
agonizing 1
fondness 1
did 1
i 1
feel 1
for 1
them 1
how 1
did 1
i 1
cling 1
to 1
their 1
dear 1
forms 1
as 1
sometimes 1
they 1
haunted 1
even 1
my 1
waking 1
hours 1
and 1
persuade 1
myself 1
that 1
they 1
still 1
lived 1
at 1
such 1
moments 1
vengeance 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
i 1
pursued 1
my 1
path 1
towards 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
task 1
enjoined 1
by 1
heaven 1
as 1
the 1
mechanical 1
impulse 1
of 1
some 1
power 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
unconscious 1
than 1
as 1
the 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
what 1
his 1
feelings 1
were 1
whom 1
i 1
pursued 1
i 1
cannot 1
know 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
he 1
left 1
marks 1
in 1
writing 1
on 1
the 1
barks 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
cut 1
in 1
stone 1
that 1
guided 1
me 1
and 1
instigated 1
my 1
fury 1
my 1
reign 1

not 1

of 1

the 1
everlasting 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
north 1

you 1
will 1
feel 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
cold 1
and 1
frost 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
impassive 1
you 1

enemy 1

hard 1

miserable 1

thee 1
miserable 1

i 1
give 1
up 1
my 1
search 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
i 1
perish 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
what 1
ecstasy 1
shall 1
i 1
join 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
departed 1
friends 1
who 1
even 1
now 1
prepare 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
tedious 1
toil 1
and 1
horrible 1
pilgrimage 1
as 1
i 1
still 1
pursued 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
northward 1
the 1
snows 1
thickened 1
and 1
the 1
cold 1
increased 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
almost 1
too 1
severe 1
to 1
support 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
hovels 1
and 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
hardy 1
ventured 1
forth 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
animals 1
whom 1
starvation 1
had 1
forced 1
from 1
their 1
hidingplaces 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
prey 1
the 1
rivers 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
ice 1
and 1
no 1
fish 1
could 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
thus 1
i 1
was 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
my 1
chief 1
article 1
of 1
maintenance 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
increased 1
with 1
the 1
difficulty 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
one 1
inscription 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
was 1
in 1
these 1
words 1
prepare 1
your 1
toils 1
only 1
begin 1
wrap 1
yourself 1
in 1
furs 1
and 1
provide 1
food 1
for 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
enter 1
upon 1
a 1
journey 1
where 1
your 1
sufferings 1
will 1
satisfy 1
my 1
everlasting 1
hatred 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
perseverance 1
were 1
invigorated 1
by 1
these 1
scoffing 1
words 1
i 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fail 1
in 1
my 1
purpose 1
and 1
calling 1
on 1
heaven 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
with 1
unabated 1
fervour 1
to 1
traverse 1
immense 1
deserts 1
until 1
the 1
ocean 1
appeared 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
formed 1
the 1
utmost 1
boundary 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
oh 1
how 1
unlike 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
blue 1
seasons 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
covered 1
with 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
distinguished 1
from 1
land 1
by 1
its 1
superior 1
wildness 1
and 1
ruggedness 1
the 1
greeks 1
wept 1
for 1
joy 1
when 1
they 1
beheld 1
the 1
mediterranean 1
from 1
the 1
hills 1
of 1
asia 1
and 1
hailed 1
with 1
rapture 1
the 1
boundary 1
of 1
their 1
toils 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
weep 1
but 1
i 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
full 1
heart 1
thanked 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
for 1
conducting 1
me 1
in 1
safety 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
hoped 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
adversarys 1
gibe 1
to 1
meet 1
and 1
grapple 1
with 1
him 1
some 1
weeks 1
before 1
this 1
period 1
i 1
had 1
procured 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
dogs 1
and 1
thus 1
traversed 1
the 1
snows 1
with 1
inconceivable 1
speed 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
whether 1
the 1
fiend 1
possessed 1
the 1
same 1
advantages 1
but 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
as 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
daily 1
lost 1
ground 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
i 1
now 1
gained 1
on 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
ocean 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
days 1
journey 1
in 1
advance 1
and 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
intercept 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
should 1
reach 1
the 1
beach 1
with 1
new 1
courage 1
therefore 1
i 1
pressed 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
wretched 1
hamlet 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
i 1
inquired 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
concerning 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
gained 1
accurate 1
information 1
a 1
gigantic 1
monster 1
they 1
said 1
had 1
arrived 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
armed 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
and 1
many 1
pistols 1
putting 1
to 1
flight 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
a 1
solitary 1
cottage 1
through 1
fear 1
of 1
his 1
terrific 1
appearance 1
he 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
their 1
store 1
of 1
winter 1
food 1
and 1
placing 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
sledge 1
to 1
draw 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
seized 1
on 1
a 1
numerous 1
drove 1
of 1
trained 1
dogs 1
he 1
had 1
harnessed 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
the 1
horrorstruck 1
villagers 1
had 1
pursued 1
his 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
sea 1
in 1
a 1
direction 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
no 1
land 1
and 1
they 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
speedily 1
be 1
destroyed 1
by 1
the 1
breaking 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
or 1
frozen 1
by 1
the 1
eternal 1
frosts 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
information 1
i 1
suffered 1
a 1
temporary 1
access 1
of 1
despair 1
he 1
had 1
escaped 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
commence 1
a 1
destructive 1
and 1
almost 1
endless 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
mountainous 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
amidst 1
cold 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
could 1
long 1
endure 1
and 1
which 1
i 1
the 1
native 1
of 1
a 1
genial 1
and 1
sunny 1
climate 1
could 1
not 1
hope 1
to 1
survive 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
triumphant 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
vengeance 1
returned 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
tide 1
overwhelmed 1
every 1
other 1
feeling 1
after 1
a 1
slight 1
repose 1
during 1
which 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
hovered 1
round 1
and 1
instigated 1
me 1
to 1
toil 1
and 1
revenge 1
i 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
i 1
exchanged 1
my 1
landsledge 1
for 1
one 1
fashioned 1
for 1
the 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
frozen 1
ocean 1
and 1
purchasing 1
a 1
plentiful 1
stock 1
of 1
provisions 1
i 1
departed 1
from 1
land 1
i 1
cannot 1
guess 1
how 1
many 1
days 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
eternal 1
sentiment 1
of 1
a 1
just 1
retribution 1
burning 1
within 1
my 1
heart 1
could 1
have 1
enabled 1
me 1
to 1
support 1
immense 1
and 1
rugged 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
often 1
barred 1
up 1
my 1
passage 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
which 1
threatened 1
my 1
destruction 1
but 1
again 1
the 1
frost 1
came 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
secure 1
by 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
provision 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
consumed 1
i 1
should 1
guess 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
passed 1
three 1
weeks 1
in 1
this 1
journey 1
and 1
the 1
continual 1
protraction 1
of 1
hope 1
returning 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
heart 1
often 1
wrung 1
bitter 1
drops 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
grief 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
despair 1
had 1
indeed 1
almost 1
secured 1
her 1
prey 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
beneath 1
this 1
misery 1
once 1
after 1
the 1
poor 1
animals 1
that 1
conveyed 1
me 1
had 1
with 1
incredible 1
toil 1
gained 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
a 1
sloping 1
ice 1
mountain 1
and 1
one 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
fatigue 1
died 1
i 1
viewed 1
the 1
expanse 1
before 1
me 1
with 1
anguish 1
when 1
suddenly 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
a 1
dark 1
speck 1
upon 1
the 1
dusky 1
plain 1
i 1
strained 1
my 1
sight 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
wild 1
cry 1
of 1
ecstasy 1
when 1
i 1
distinguished 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
the 1
distorted 1
proportions 1
of 1
a 1
wellknown 1
form 1
within 1
oh 1
with 1
what 1
a 1
burning 1
gush 1
did 1
hope 1
revisit 1
my 1
heart 1
warm 1
tears 1
filled 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
i 1
hastily 1
wiped 1
away 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
intercept 1
the 1
view 1
i 1
had 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
but 1
still 1
my 1
sight 1
was 1
dimmed 1
by 1
the 1
burning 1
drops 1
until 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
emotions 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
i 1
wept 1
aloud 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
delay 1
i 1
disencumbered 1
the 1
dogs 1
of 1
their 1
dead 1
companion 1
gave 1
them 1
a 1
plentiful 1
portion 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
after 1
an 1
hours 1
rest 1
which 1
was 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
and 1
yet 1
which 1
was 1
bitterly 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
route 1
the 1
sledge 1
was 1
still 1
visible 1
nor 1
did 1
i 1
again 1
lose 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
except 1
at 1
the 1
moments 1
when 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
some 1
icerock 1
concealed 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
intervening 1
crags 1
i 1
indeed 1
perceptibly 1
gained 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
after 1
nearly 1
two 1
days 1
journey 1
i 1
beheld 1
my 1
enemy 1
at 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mile 1
distant 1
my 1
heart 1
bounded 1
within 1
me 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
appeared 1
almost 1
within 1
grasp 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
my 1
hopes 1
were 1
suddenly 1
extinguished 1
and 1
i 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
more 1
utterly 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
before 1
a 1
ground 1
sea 1
was 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
its 1
progress 1
as 1
the 1
waters 1
rolled 1
and 1
swelled 1
beneath 1
me 1
became 1
every 1
moment 1
more 1
ominous 1
and 1
terrific 1
i 1
pressed 1
on 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
the 1
wind 1
arose 1
the 1
sea 1
roared 1
and 1
as 1
with 1
the 1
mighty 1
shock 1
of 1
an 1
earthquake 1
it 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
with 1
a 1
tremendous 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
sound 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
soon 1
finished 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
a 1
tumultuous 1
sea 1
rolled 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
drifting 1
on 1
a 1
scattered 1
piece 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
was 1
continually 1
lessening 1
and 1
thus 1
preparing 1
for 1
me 1
a 1
hideous 1
death 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
many 1
appalling 1
hours 1
passed 1
several 1
of 1
my 1
dogs 1
died 1
and 1
i 1
myself 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sink 1
under 1
the 1
accumulation 1
of 1
distress 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
your 1
vessel 1
riding 1
at 1
anchor 1
and 1
holding 1
forth 1
to 1
me 1
hopes 1
of 1
succour 1
and 1
life 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
conception 1
that 1
vessels 1
ever 1
came 1
so 1
far 1
north 1
and 1
was 1
astounded 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
i 1
quickly 1
destroyed 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
sledge 1
to 1
construct 1
oars 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
was 1
enabled 1
with 1
infinite 1
fatigue 1
to 1
move 1
my 1
ice 1
raft 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
your 1
ship 1
i 1
had 1
determined 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
southwards 1
still 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
rather 1
than 1
abandon 1
my 1
purpose 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
induce 1
you 1
to 1
grant 1
me 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
but 1
your 1
direction 1
was 1
northwards 1
you 1
took 1
me 1
on 1
board 1
when 1
my 1
vigour 1
was 1
exhausted 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
multiplied 1
hardships 1
into 1
a 1
death 1
which 1
i 1
still 1
dread 1
for 1
my 1
task 1
is 1
unfulfilled 1
oh 1
when 1
will 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
in 1
conducting 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
daemon 1
allow 1
me 1
the 1
rest 1
i 1
so 1
much 1
desire 1
or 1
must 1
i 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
yet 1
live 1

i 1
do 1
swear 1
to 1
me 1
walton 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
escape 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
seek 1
him 1
and 1
satisfy 1
my 1
vengeance 1
in 1
his 1
death 1
and 1
do 1
i 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
hardships 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
undergone 1
no 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
selfish 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
dead 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
if 1
the 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
should 1
conduct 1
him 1
to 1
you 1

that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
liveswear 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1

over 1
my 1
accumulated 1
woes 1

to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
his 1
dark 1
crimes 1

and 1
persuasive 1

form 1

of 1
treachery 1

you 1
have 1
read 1
this 1
strange 1
and 1
terrific 1
story 1
margaret 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
feel 1
your 1
blood 1
congeal 1
with 1
horror 1
like 1
that 1
which 1
even 1
now 1
curdles 1
mine 1
sometimes 1
seized 1
with 1
sudden 1
agony 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
continue 1
his 1
tale 1
at 1
others 1
his 1
voice 1
broken 1
yet 1
piercing 1
uttered 1
with 1
difficulty 1
the 1
words 1
so 1
replete 1
with 1
anguish 1
his 1
fine 1
and 1
lovely 1
eyes 1
were 1
now 1
lighted 1
up 1
with 1
indignation 1
now 1
subdued 1
to 1
downcast 1
sorrow 1
and 1
quenched 1
in 1
infinite 1
wretchedness 1
sometimes 1
he 1
commanded 1
his 1
countenance 1
and 1
tones 1
and 1
related 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
incidents 1
with 1
a 1
tranquil 1
voice 1
suppressing 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
agitation 1
then 1
like 1
a 1
volcano 1
bursting 1
forth 1
his 1
face 1
would 1
suddenly 1
change 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
as 1
he 1
shrieked 1
out 1
imprecations 1
on 1
his 1
persecutor 1
his 1
tale 1
is 1
connected 1
and 1
told 1
with 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
simplest 1
truth 1
yet 1
i 1
own 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
safie 1
which 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
seen 1
from 1
our 1
ship 1
brought 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
greater 1
conviction 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
his 1
narrative 1
than 1
his 1
asseverations 1
however 1
earnest 1
and 1
connected 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
has 1
then 1
really 1
existence 1
i 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
it 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
lost 1
in 1
surprise 1
and 1
admiration 1
sometimes 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
frankenstein 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
his 1
creatures 1
formation 1
but 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
impenetrable 1
are 1
you 1
mad 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
or 1
whither 1
does 1
your 1
senseless 1
curiosity 1
lead 1
you 1

my 1

do 1

frankenstein 1
discovered 1
that 1
i 1
made 1
notes 1
concerning 1
his 1
history 1
he 1
asked 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
corrected 1
and 1
augmented 1
them 1
in 1
many 1
places 1
but 1
principally 1
in 1
giving 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
conversations 1
he 1
held 1
with 1
his 1
enemy 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
preserved 1
my 1
narration 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
that 1
a 1
mutilated 1
one 1
should 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
posterity 1
thus 1
has 1
a 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
while 1
i 1
have 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
strangest 1
tale 1
that 1
ever 1
imagination 1
formed 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
have 1
been 1
drunk 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
interest 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
which 1
this 1
tale 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
elevated 1
and 1
gentle 1
manners 1
have 1
created 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
soothe 1
him 1
yet 1
can 1
i 1
counsel 1
one 1
so 1
infinitely 1
miserable 1
so 1
destitute 1
of 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
consolation 1
to 1
live 1
oh 1
no 1
the 1
only 1
joy 1
that 1
he 1
can 1
now 1
know 1
will 1
be 1
when 1
he 1
composes 1
his 1
shattered 1
spirit 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
death 1
yet 1
he 1
enjoys 1
one 1
comfort 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
solitude 1
and 1
delirium 1
he 1
believes 1
that 1
when 1
in 1
dreams 1
he 1
holds 1
converse 1
with 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
derives 1
from 1
that 1
communion 1
consolation 1
for 1
his 1
miseries 1
or 1
excitements 1
to 1
his 1
vengeance 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
creations 1
of 1
his 1
fancy 1
but 1
the 1
beings 1
themselves 1
who 1
visit 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
of 1
a 1
remote 1
world 1
this 1
faith 1
gives 1
a 1
solemnity 1
to 1
his 1
reveries 1
that 1
render 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
almost 1
as 1
imposing 1
and 1
interesting 1
as 1
truth 1
our 1
conversations 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
history 1
and 1
misfortunes 1
on 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
general 1

he 1
displays 1
unbounded 1
knowledge 1
and 1
a 1
quick 1
and 1
piercing 1
apprehension 1
his 1
eloquence 1
is 1
forcible 1
and 1
touching 1
nor 1

him 1
when 1
he 1
relates 1

or 1
endeavours 1

the 1
passions 1
of 1
pity 1

of 1
his 1

godlike 1

when 1
younger 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
destined 1
for 1
some 1
great 1
enterprise 1
my 1
feelings 1
are 1
profound 1
but 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
coolness 1
of 1
judgment 1
that 1
fitted 1
me 1
for 1
illustrious 1
achievements 1
this 1
sentiment 1
of 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
supported 1
me 1
when 1
others 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
oppressed 1
for 1
i 1
deemed 1
it 1
criminal 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
in 1
useless 1
grief 1
those 1
talents 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
work 1
i 1
had 1
completed 1
no 1
less 1
a 1
one 1
than 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
and 1
rational 1
animal 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
rank 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
herd 1
of 1
common 1
projectors 1
but 1
this 1
thought 1
which 1
supported 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
career 1
now 1
serves 1
only 1
to 1
plunge 1
me 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
all 1
my 1
speculations 1
and 1
hopes 1
are 1
as 1
nothing 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
archangel 1
who 1
aspired 1
to 1
omnipotence 1
i 1
am 1
chained 1
in 1
an 1
eternal 1
hell 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
vivid 1
yet 1
my 1
powers 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
application 1
were 1
intense 1
by 1
the 1
union 1
of 1
these 1
qualities 1
i 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
executed 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
cannot 1
recollect 1
without 1
passion 1
my 1
reveries 1
while 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
incomplete 1
i 1
trod 1
heaven 1
in 1
my 1
thoughts 1
now 1
exulting 1
in 1
my 1
powers 1
now 1
burning 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
their 1
effects 1
from 1
my 1
infancy 1
i 1
was 1
imbued 1
with 1
high 1
hopes 1
and 1
a 1
lofty 1
ambition 1
but 1
how 1
am 1
i 1
sunk 1
oh 1
my 1
friend 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
known 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
once 1
was 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
recognize 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
degradation 1
despondency 1
rarely 1
visited 1
my 1
heart 1
a 1
high 1
destiny 1
seemed 1
to 1
bear 1
me 1
on 1
until 1
i 1
fell 1
never 1
never 1
again 1
to 1
rise 1
must 1
i 1
then 1
lose 1
this 1
admirable 1
being 1
i 1
have 1
longed 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
i 1
have 1
sought 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
sympathize 1
with 1
and 1
love 1
me 1
behold 1
on 1
these 1
desert 1
seas 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
i 1
have 1
gained 1
him 1
only 1
to 1
know 1
his 1
value 1
and 1
lose 1
him 1
i 1
would 1
reconcile 1
him 1
to 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
repulses 1
the 1
idea 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
walton 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
your 1
kind 1
intentions 1
towards 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
wretch 1
but 1
when 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
new 1
ties 1
and 1
fresh 1
affections 1
think 1
you 1
that 1
any 1
can 1
replace 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
gone 1
can 1
any 1
man 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
clerval 1
was 1
or 1
any 1
woman 1
another 1
elizabeth 1
even 1
where 1
the 1
affections 1
are 1
not 1
strongly 1
moved 1
by 1
any 1
superior 1
excellence 1
the 1
companions 1
of 1
our 1
childhood 1
always 1
possess 1
a 1
certain 1
power 1
over 1
our 1
minds 1
which 1
hardly 1
any 1
later 1
friend 1
can 1
obtain 1
they 1
know 1
our 1
infantine 1
dispositions 1
which 1
however 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
afterwards 1
modified 1
are 1
never 1
eradicated 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
judge 1
of 1
our 1
actions 1
with 1
more 1
certain 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
our 1
motives 1
a 1
sister 1
or 1
a 1
brother 1
can 1
never 1
unless 1
indeed 1
such 1
symptoms 1
have 1
been 1
shown 1
early 1
suspect 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
fraud 1
or 1
false 1
dealing 1
when 1
another 1
friend 1
however 1
strongly 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
attached 1
may 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
be 1
contemplated 1
with 1
suspicion 1
but 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
friends 1
dear 1
not 1
only 1
through 1
habit 1
and 1
association 1
but 1
from 1
their 1
own 1
merits 1
and 1
wherever 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
soothing 1
voice 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
clerval 1
will 1
be 1
ever 1
whispered 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
they 1
are 1
dead 1
and 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
solitude 1
can 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
engaged 1
in 1
any 1
high 1
undertaking 1
or 1
design 1
fraught 1
with 1
extensive 1
utility 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
then 1
could 1
i 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
but 1
such 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
destiny 1
i 1
must 1
pursue 1
and 1
destroy 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
gave 1
existence 1
then 1
my 1
lot 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
die 1
september 1
2nd 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
i 1
write 1
to 1
you 1
encompassed 1
by 1
peril 1
and 1
ignorant 1
whether 1
i 1
am 1
ever 1
doomed 1
to 1
see 1
again 1
dear 1
england 1
and 1
the 1
dearer 1
friends 1
that 1
inhabit 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
admit 1
of 1
no 1
escape 1
and 1
threaten 1
every 1
moment 1
to 1
crush 1
my 1
vessel 1
the 1
brave 1
fellows 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
persuaded 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
companions 1
look 1
towards 1
me 1
for 1
aid 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
none 1
to 1
bestow 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
terribly 1
appalling 1
in 1
our 1
situation 1
yet 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
hopes 1
do 1
not 1
desert 1
me 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
terrible 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
men 1
are 1
endangered 1
through 1
me 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
lost 1
my 1
mad 1
schemes 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
what 1
margaret 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
my 1
destruction 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
anxiously 1
await 1
my 1
return 1
years 1
will 1
pass 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
visitings 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
tortured 1
by 1
hope 1
oh 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
the 1
sickening 1
failing 1
of 1
your 1
heartfelt 1
expectations 1
is 1
in 1
prospect 1
more 1
terrible 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
lovely 1
children 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
happy 1
heaven 1
bless 1
you 1
and 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
regards 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
tenderest 1
compassion 1
he 1
endeavours 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
talks 1
as 1
if 1
life 1
were 1
a 1
possession 1
which 1
he 1
valued 1
he 1
reminds 1
me 1
how 1
often 1
the 1
same 1
accidents 1
have 1
happened 1
to 1
other 1
navigators 1
who 1
have 1
attempted 1
this 1
sea 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
myself 1
he 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
cheerful 1
auguries 1
even 1
the 1
sailors 1
feel 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
his 1
eloquence 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
they 1
no 1
longer 1
despair 1
he 1
rouses 1
their 1
energies 1
and 1
while 1
they 1
hear 1
his 1
voice 1
they 1
believe 1
these 1
vast 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
are 1
molehills 1
which 1
will 1
vanish 1
before 1
the 1
resolutions 1
of 1
man 1
these 1
feelings 1
are 1
transitory 1
each 1
day 1
of 1
expectation 1
delayed 1
fills 1
them 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
i 1
almost 1
dread 1
a 1
mutiny 1
caused 1
by 1
this 1
despair 1
september 1
5th 1
a 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
passed 1
of 1
such 1
uncommon 1
interest 1
that 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
highly 1
probable 1
that 1
these 1
papers 1
may 1
never 1
reach 1
you 1
yet 1
i 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
we 1
are 1
still 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
still 1
in 1
imminent 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
crushed 1
in 1
their 1
conflict 1
the 1
cold 1
is 1
excessive 1
and 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
comrades 1
have 1
already 1
found 1
a 1
grave 1
amidst 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
desolation 1
frankenstein 1
has 1
daily 1
declined 1
in 1
health 1
a 1
feverish 1
fire 1
still 1
glimmers 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
when 1
suddenly 1
roused 1
to 1
any 1
exertion 1
he 1
speedily 1
sinks 1
again 1
into 1
apparent 1
lifelessness 1
i 1
mentioned 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
letter 1
the 1
fears 1
i 1
entertained 1
of 1
a 1
mutiny 1
this 1
morning 1
as 1
i 1
sat 1
watching 1
the 1
wan 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
friendhis 1
eyes 1
half 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
limbs 1
hanging 1
listlesslyi 1
was 1
roused 1
by 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
who 1
demanded 1
admission 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
they 1
entered 1
and 1
their 1
leader 1
addressed 1
me 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
had 1
been 1
chosen 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
sailors 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
deputation 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
a 1
requisition 1
which 1
in 1
justice 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
we 1
were 1
immured 1
in 1
ice 1
and 1
should 1
probably 1
never 1
escape 1
but 1
they 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
as 1
was 1
possible 1
the 1
ice 1
should 1
dissipate 1
and 1
a 1
free 1
passage 1
be 1
opened 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
rash 1
enough 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
voyage 1
and 1
lead 1
them 1
into 1
fresh 1
dangers 1
after 1
they 1
might 1
happily 1
have 1
surmounted 1
this 1
they 1
insisted 1
therefore 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
engage 1
with 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
vessel 1
should 1
be 1
freed 1
i 1
would 1
instantly 1
direct 1
my 1
course 1
southwards 1
this 1
speech 1
troubled 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
despaired 1
nor 1
had 1
i 1
yet 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
returning 1
if 1
set 1
free 1
yet 1
could 1
i 1
in 1
justice 1
or 1
even 1
in 1
possibility 1
refuse 1
this 1
demand 1
i 1
hesitated 1
before 1
i 1
answered 1
when 1
frankenstein 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
been 1
silent 1
and 1
indeed 1
appeared 1
hardly 1
to 1
have 1
force 1
enough 1
to 1
attend 1
now 1
roused 1
himself 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
with 1
momentary 1
vigour 1
turning 1
towards 1
the 1
men 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
demand 1
of 1
your 1
captain 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
so 1
easily 1
turned 1
from 1
your 1
design 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
call 1
this 1
a 1
glorious 1
expedition 1
and 1
wherefore 1
was 1
it 1
glorious 1
not 1
because 1
the 1
way 1
was 1
smooth 1
and 1
placid 1
as 1
a 1
southern 1
sea 1
but 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
dangers 1
and 1
terror 1
because 1
at 1
every 1
new 1
incident 1
your 1
fortitude 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
your 1
courage 1
exhibited 1
because 1
danger 1
and 1
death 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
these 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
brave 1
and 1
overcome 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
a 1
glorious 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
an 1
honourable 1
undertaking 1
you 1
were 1
hereafter 1
to 1
be 1
hailed 1
as 1
the 1
benefactors 1
of 1
your 1
species 1
your 1
names 1
adored 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
brave 1
men 1
who 1
encountered 1
death 1
for 1
honour 1
and 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
mankind 1
and 1
now 1
behold 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
imagination 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
the 1
first 1
mighty 1
and 1
terrific 1
trial 1
of 1
your 1
courage 1
you 1
shrink 1
away 1
and 1
are 1
content 1
to 1
be 1
handed 1
down 1
as 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
endure 1
cold 1
and 1
peril 1
and 1
so 1
poor 1
souls 1
they 1
were 1
chilly 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
their 1
warm 1
firesides 1
why 1
that 1
requires 1
not 1
this 1
preparation 1
ye 1
need 1
not 1
have 1
come 1
thus 1
far 1
and 1
dragged 1
your 1
captain 1
to 1
the 1
shame 1
of 1
a 1
defeat 1
merely 1
to 1
prove 1
yourselves 1
cowards 1
oh 1
be 1
men 1
or 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
men 1
be 1
steady 1
to 1
your 1
purposes 1
and 1
firm 1
as 1
a 1
rock 1
this 1
ice 1
is 1
not 1
made 1
of 1
such 1
stuff 1
as 1
your 1
hearts 1
may 1
be 1
it 1
is 1
mutable 1
and 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
shall 1
not 1
do 1
not 1
return 1
to 1
your 1
families 1
with 1
the 1
stigma 1
of 1
disgrace 1
marked 1
on 1
your 1
brows 1
return 1
as 1
heroes 1
who 1
have 1
fought 1
and 1
conquered 1
and 1
who 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
turn 1
their 1
backs 1
on 1
the 1
foe 1
he 1
spoke 1
this 1
with 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
modulated 1
to 1
the 1
different 1
feelings 1
expressed 1
in 1
his 1
speech 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
lofty 1
design 1
and 1
heroism 1
that 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
these 1
men 1
were 1
moved 1
they 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
reply 1
i 1
spoke 1
i 1
told 1
them 1
to 1
retire 1
and 1
consider 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
lead 1
them 1
farther 1
north 1
if 1
they 1
strenuously 1
desired 1
the 1
contrary 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
hoped 1
that 1
with 1
reflection 1
their 1
courage 1
would 1
return 1
they 1
retired 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
towards 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
sunk 1
in 1
languor 1
and 1
almost 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
how 1
all 1
this 1
will 1
terminate 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
return 1
shamefully 1
my 1
purpose 1
unfulfilled 1
yet 1
i 1
fear 1
such 1
will 1
be 1
my 1
fate 1
the 1
men 1
unsupported 1
by 1
ideas 1
of 1
glory 1
and 1
honour 1
can 1
never 1
willingly 1
continue 1
to 1
endure 1
their 1
present 1
hardships 1
september 1
7th 1
the 1
die 1
is 1
cast 1
i 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
return 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
destroyed 1
thus 1
are 1
my 1
hopes 1
blasted 1
by 1
cowardice 1
and 1
indecision 1
i 1
come 1
back 1
ignorant 1
and 1
disappointed 1
it 1
requires 1
more 1
philosophy 1
than 1
i 1
possess 1
to 1
bear 1
this 1
injustice 1
with 1
patience 1
september 1
12th 1
it 1
is 1
past 1
i 1
am 1
returning 1
to 1
england 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
hopes 1
of 1
utility 1
and 1
glory 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
detail 1
these 1
bitter 1
circumstances 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
am 1
wafted 1
towards 1
england 1
and 1
towards 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
despond 1
september 1
9th 1
the 1
ice 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
roarings 1
like 1
thunder 1
were 1
heard 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
as 1
the 1
islands 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
imminent 1
peril 1
but 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
only 1
remain 1
passive 1
my 1
chief 1
attention 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
whose 1
illness 1
increased 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
degree 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
the 1
ice 1
cracked 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
was 1
driven 1
with 1
force 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
a 1
breeze 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
11th 1
the 1
passage 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
became 1
perfectly 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
sailors 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
their 1
return 1
to 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
was 1
apparently 1
assured 1
a 1
shout 1
of 1
tumultuous 1
joy 1
broke 1
from 1
them 1
loud 1
and 1
longcontinued 1
frankenstein 1
who 1
was 1
dozing 1
awoke 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
tumult 1
they 1
shout 1
i 1
said 1
because 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
return 1
to 1
england 1
do 1
you 1
then 1
really 1
return 1
alas 1
yes 1
i 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
their 1
demands 1
i 1
cannot 1
lead 1
them 1
unwillingly 1
to 1
danger 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
return 1
do 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
you 1
may 1
give 1
up 1
your 1
purpose 1
but 1
mine 1
is 1
assigned 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
heaven 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
weak 1
but 1
surely 1
the 1
spirits 1
who 1
assist 1
my 1
vengeance 1
will 1
endow 1
me 1
with 1
sufficient 1
strength 1
saying 1
this 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
spring 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
exertion 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
and 1
fainted 1
it 1
was 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
restored 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
thought 1
that 1
life 1
was 1
entirely 1
extinct 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
breathed 1
with 1
difficulty 1
and 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
surgeon 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
composing 1
draught 1
and 1
ordered 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
undisturbed 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
certainly 1
not 1
many 1
hours 1
to 1
live 1
his 1
sentence 1
was 1
pronounced 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
grieve 1
and 1
be 1
patient 1
i 1
sat 1
by 1
his 1
bed 1
watching 1
him 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
closed 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
he 1
slept 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
and 1
bidding 1
me 1
come 1
near 1
said 1
alas 1
the 1
strength 1
i 1
relied 1
on 1
is 1
gone 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
persecutor 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
in 1
being 1
think 1
not 1
walton 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
burning 1
hatred 1
and 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
i 1
once 1
expressed 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
myself 1
justified 1
in 1
desiring 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1
during 1
these 1
last 1
days 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
occupied 1
in 1
examining 1
my 1
past 1
conduct 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
blamable 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
madness 1
i 1
created 1
a 1
rational 1
creature 1
and 1
was 1
bound 1
towards 1
him 1
to 1
assure 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
his 1
happiness 1
and 1
wellbeing 1
this 1
was 1
my 1
duty 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
still 1
paramount 1
to 1
that 1
my 1
duties 1
towards 1
the 1
beings 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
species 1
had 1
greater 1
claims 1
to 1
my 1
attention 1
because 1
they 1
included 1
a 1
greater 1
proportion 1
of 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
urged 1
by 1
this 1
view 1
i 1
refused 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
right 1
in 1
refusing 1
to 1
create 1
a 1
companion 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
creature 1
he 1
showed 1
unparalleled 1
malignity 1
and 1
selfishness 1
in 1
evil 1
he 1
destroyed 1
my 1
friends 1
he 1
devoted 1
to 1
destruction 1
beings 1
who 1
possessed 1
exquisite 1
sensations 1
happiness 1
and 1
wisdom 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
this 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
may 1
end 1
miserable 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
render 1
no 1
other 1
wretched 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
die 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
his 1
destruction 1
was 1
mine 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
failed 1
when 1
actuated 1
by 1
selfish 1
and 1
vicious 1
motives 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
unfinished 1
work 1
and 1
i 1
renew 1
this 1
request 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
induced 1
by 1
reason 1
and 1
virtue 1
yet 1
i 1
cannot 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
renounce 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
friends 1
to 1
fulfil 1
this 1
task 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
returning 1
to 1
england 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
little 1
chance 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
consideration 1
of 1
these 1
points 1
and 1
the 1
well 1
balancing 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
may 1
esteem 1
your 1
duties 1
i 1
leave 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
judgment 1
and 1
ideas 1
are 1
already 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
near 1
approach 1
of 1
death 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
right 1
for 1
i 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
misled 1
by 1
passion 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
instrument 1
of 1
mischief 1
disturbs 1
me 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
this 1
hour 1
when 1
i 1
momentarily 1
expect 1
my 1
release 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
happy 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
enjoyed 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
the 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
beloved 1
dead 1
flit 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
hasten 1
to 1
their 1
arms 1
farewell 1
walton 1
seek 1
happiness 1
in 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
avoid 1
ambition 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
only 1
the 1
apparently 1
innocent 1
one 1
of 1
distinguishing 1
yourself 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
discoveries 1
yet 1
why 1
do 1
i 1
say 1
this 1
i 1
have 1
myself 1
been 1
blasted 1
in 1
these 1
hopes 1
yet 1
another 1
may 1
succeed 1
his 1
voice 1
became 1
fainter 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
exhausted 1
by 1
his 1
effort 1
he 1
sank 1
into 1
silence 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
he 1
attempted 1
again 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
he 1
pressed 1
my 1
hand 1
feebly 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
forever 1
while 1
the 1
irradiation 1
of 1
a 1
gentle 1
smile 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
margaret 1
what 1
comment 1
can 1
i 1
make 1
on 1
the 1
untimely 1
extinction 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
spirit 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
will 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
my 1
sorrow 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
express 1
would 1
be 1
inadequate 1
and 1
feeble 1
my 1
tears 1
flow 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
overshadowed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
disappointment 1
but 1
i 1
journey 1
towards 1
england 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
there 1
find 1
consolation 1
i 1
am 1
interrupted 1
what 1
do 1
these 1
sounds 1
portend 1
it 1
is 1
midnight 1
the 1
breeze 1
blows 1
fairly 1
and 1
the 1
watch 1
on 1
deck 1
scarcely 1
stir 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
voice 1
but 1
hoarser 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
frankenstein 1
still 1
lie 1
i 1
must 1
arise 1
and 1
examine 1
good 1
night 1
my 1
sister 1
great 1
god 1
what 1
a 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
taken 1
place 1
i 1
am 1
yet 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
hardly 1
know 1
whether 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
detail 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
tale 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
be 1
incomplete 1
without 1
this 1
final 1
and 1
wonderful 1
catastrophe 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
illfated 1
and 1
admirable 1
friend 1
over 1
him 1
hung 1
a 1
form 1
which 1
i 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
describegigantic 1
in 1
stature 1
yet 1
uncouth 1
and 1
distorted 1
in 1
its 1
proportions 1
as 1
he 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
coffin 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
concealed 1
by 1
long 1
locks 1
of 1
ragged 1
hair 1
but 1
one 1
vast 1
hand 1
was 1
extended 1
in 1
colour 1
and 1
apparent 1
texture 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
mummy 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
my 1
approach 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
utter 1
exclamations 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
horror 1
and 1
sprung 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
never 1
did 1
i 1
behold 1
a 1
vision 1
so 1
horrible 1
as 1
his 1
face 1
of 1
such 1
loathsome 1
yet 1
appalling 1
hideousness 1
i 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
involuntarily 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
recollect 1
what 1
were 1
my 1
duties 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
this 1
destroyer 1
i 1
called 1
on 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
he 1
paused 1
looking 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
again 1
turning 1
towards 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
his 1
creator 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
forget 1
my 1
presence 1
and 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
gesture 1
seemed 1
instigated 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
of 1
some 1
uncontrollable 1
passion 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
victim 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
his 1
murder 1
my 1
crimes 1
are 1
consummated 1
the 1
miserable 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
is 1
wound 1
to 1
its 1
close 1
oh 1
frankenstein 1
generous 1
and 1
selfdevoted 1
being 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
avail 1
that 1
i 1
now 1
ask 1
thee 1
to 1
pardon 1
me 1
i 1
who 1
irretrievably 1
destroyed 1
thee 1
by 1
destroying 1
all 1
thou 1
lovedst 1
alas 1
he 1
is 1
cold 1
he 1
cannot 1
answer 1
me 1
his 1
voice 1
seemed 1
suffocated 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
impulses 1
which 1
had 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
obeying 1
the 1
dying 1
request 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
destroying 1
his 1
enemy 1
were 1
now 1
suspended 1
by 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
i 1
approached 1
this 1
tremendous 1
being 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
again 1
raise 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
scaring 1
and 1
unearthly 1
in 1
his 1
ugliness 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
the 1
monster 1
continued 1
to 1
utter 1
wild 1
and 1
incoherent 1
selfreproaches 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
gathered 1
resolution 1
to 1
address 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
the 1
tempest 1
of 1
his 1
passion 1
your 1
repentance 1
i 1
said 1
is 1
now 1
superfluous 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
heeded 1
the 1
stings 1
of 1
remorse 1
before 1
you 1
had 1
urged 1
your 1
diabolical 1
vengeance 1
to 1
this 1
extremity 1
frankenstein 1
would 1
yet 1
have 1
lived 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
dream 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
dead 1
to 1
agony 1
and 1
remorse 1
he 1
he 1
continued 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
corpse 1
he 1
suffered 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
the 1
deed 1
oh 1
not 1
the 1
tenthousandth 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
mine 1
during 1
the 1
lingering 1
detail 1
of 1
its 1
execution 1
a 1
frightful 1
selfishness 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
while 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
poisoned 1
with 1
remorse 1
think 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
groans 1
of 1
clerval 1
were 1
music 1
to 1
my 1
ears 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
fashioned 1
to 1
be 1
susceptible 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
and 1
when 1
wrenched 1
by 1
misery 1
to 1
vice 1
and 1
hatred 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
without 1
torture 1
such 1
as 1
you 1
cannot 1
even 1
imagine 1
after 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
clerval 1
i 1
returned 1
to 1
switzerland 1
heartbroken 1
and 1
overcome 1
i 1
pitied 1
frankenstein 1
my 1
pity 1
amounted 1
to 1
horror 1
i 1
abhorred 1
myself 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
the 1
author 1
at 1
once 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
of 1
its 1
unspeakable 1
torments 1
dared 1
to 1
hope 1
for 1
happiness 1
that 1
while 1
he 1
accumulated 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
despair 1
upon 1
me 1
he 1
sought 1
his 1
own 1
enjoyment 1
in 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
from 1
the 1
indulgence 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
forever 1
barred 1
then 1
impotent 1
envy 1
and 1
bitter 1
indignation 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
an 1
insatiable 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
i 1
recollected 1
my 1
threat 1
and 1
resolved 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
accomplished 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
preparing 1
for 1
myself 1
a 1
deadly 1
torture 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
not 1
the 1
master 1
of 1
an 1
impulse 1
which 1
i 1
detested 1
yet 1
could 1
not 1
disobey 1
yet 1
when 1
she 1
died 1
nay 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
miserable 1
i 1
had 1
cast 1
off 1
all 1
feeling 1
subdued 1
all 1
anguish 1
to 1
riot 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
my 1
despair 1
evil 1
thenceforth 1
became 1
my 1
good 1
urged 1
thus 1
far 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
adapt 1
my 1
nature 1
to 1
an 1
element 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
willingly 1
chosen 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
demoniacal 1
design 1
became 1
an 1
insatiable 1
passion 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
ended 1
there 1
is 1
my 1
last 1
victim 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
touched 1
by 1
the 1
expressions 1
of 1
his 1
misery 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
what 1
frankenstein 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
his 1
powers 1
of 1
eloquence 1
and 1
persuasion 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
again 1
cast 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
indignation 1
was 1
rekindled 1
within 1
me 1
wretch 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
to 1
whine 1
over 1
the 1
desolation 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
throw 1
a 1
torch 1
into 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
buildings 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
consumed 1
you 1
sit 1
among 1
the 1
ruins 1
and 1
lament 1
the 1
fall 1
hypocritical 1
fiend 1
if 1
he 1
whom 1
you 1
mourn 1
still 1
lived 1
still 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
the 1
object 1
again 1
would 1
he 1
become 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
your 1
accursed 1
vengeance 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
pity 1
that 1
you 1
feel 1
you 1
lament 1
only 1
because 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
your 1
malignity 1
is 1
withdrawn 1
from 1
your 1
power 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
thusnot 1
thus 1
interrupted 1
the 1
being 1
yet 1
such 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
impression 1
conveyed 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
my 1
actions 1
yet 1
i 1
seek 1
not 1
a 1
fellow 1
feeling 1
in 1
my 1
misery 1
no 1
sympathy 1
may 1
i 1
ever 1
find 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
sought 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
with 1
which 1
my 1
whole 1
being 1
overflowed 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
participated 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
virtue 1
has 1
become 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
that 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
are 1
turned 1
into 1
bitter 1
and 1
loathing 1
despair 1
in 1
what 1
should 1
i 1
seek 1
for 1
sympathy 1
i 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
suffer 1
alone 1
while 1
my 1
sufferings 1
shall 1
endure 1
when 1
i 1
die 1
i 1
am 1
well 1
satisfied 1
that 1
abhorrence 1
and 1
opprobrium 1
should 1
load 1
my 1
memory 1
once 1
my 1
fancy 1
was 1
soothed 1
with 1
dreams 1
of 1
virtue 1
of 1
fame 1
and 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
once 1
i 1
falsely 1
hoped 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
beings 1
who 1
pardoning 1
my 1
outward 1
form 1
would 1
love 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
excellent 1
qualities 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
unfolding 1
i 1
was 1
nourished 1
with 1
high 1
thoughts 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
devotion 1
but 1
now 1
crime 1
has 1
degraded 1
me 1
beneath 1
the 1
meanest 1
animal 1
no 1
guilt 1
no 1
mischief 1
no 1
malignity 1
no 1
misery 1
can 1
be 1
found 1
comparable 1
to 1
mine 1
when 1
i 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
frightful 1
catalogue 1
of 1
my 1
sins 1
i 1
cannot 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
same 1
creature 1
whose 1
thoughts 1
were 1
once 1
filled 1
with 1
sublime 1
and 1
transcendent 1
visions 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
majesty 1
of 1
goodness 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
even 1
so 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
becomes 1
a 1
malignant 1
devil 1
yet 1
even 1
that 1
enemy 1
of 1
god 1
and 1
man 1
had 1
friends 1
and 1
associates 1
in 1
his 1
desolation 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
you 1
who 1
call 1
frankenstein 1
your 1
friend 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
knowledge 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
detail 1
which 1
he 1
gave 1
you 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
sum 1
up 1
the 1
hours 1
and 1
months 1
of 1
misery 1
which 1
i 1
endured 1
wasting 1
in 1
impotent 1
passions 1
for 1
while 1
i 1
destroyed 1
his 1
hopes 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
satisfy 1
my 1
own 1
desires 1
they 1
were 1
forever 1
ardent 1
and 1
craving 1
still 1
i 1
desired 1
love 1
and 1
fellowship 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
spurned 1
was 1
there 1
no 1
injustice 1
in 1
this 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
be 1
thought 1
the 1
only 1
criminal 1
when 1
all 1
humankind 1
sinned 1
against 1
me 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
hate 1
felix 1
who 1
drove 1
his 1
friend 1
from 1
his 1
door 1
with 1
contumely 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
execrate 1
the 1
rustic 1
who 1
sought 1
to 1
destroy 1
the 1
saviour 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
nay 1
these 1
are 1
virtuous 1
and 1
immaculate 1
beings 1
i 1
the 1
miserable 1
and 1
the 1
abandoned 1
am 1
an 1
abortion 1
to 1
be 1
spurned 1
at 1
and 1
kicked 1
and 1
trampled 1
on 1
even 1
now 1
my 1
blood 1
boils 1
at 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
this 1
injustice 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
wretch 1
i 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
lovely 1
and 1
the 1
helpless 1
i 1
have 1
strangled 1
the 1
innocent 1
as 1
they 1
slept 1
and 1
grasped 1
to 1
death 1
his 1
throat 1
who 1
never 1
injured 1
me 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
living 1
thing 1
i 1
have 1
devoted 1
my 1
creator 1
the 1
select 1
specimen 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
admiration 1
among 1
men 1
to 1
misery 1
i 1
have 1
pursued 1
him 1
even 1
to 1
that 1
irremediable 1
ruin 1
there 1
he 1
lies 1
white 1
and 1
cold 1
in 1
death 1
you 1
hate 1
me 1
but 1
your 1
abhorrence 1
cannot 1
equal 1
that 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
regard 1
myself 1
i 1
look 1
on 1
the 1
hands 1
which 1
executed 1
the 1
deed 1
i 1
think 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
conceived 1
and 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
these 1
hands 1
will 1
meet 1
my 1
eyes 1
when 1
that 1
imagination 1
will 1
haunt 1
my 1
thoughts 1
no 1
more 1
fear 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
the 1
instrument 1
of 1
future 1
mischief 1
my 1
work 1
is 1
nearly 1
complete 1
neither 1
yours 1
nor 1
any 1
mans 1
death 1
is 1
needed 1
to 1
consummate 1
the 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
and 1
accomplish 1
that 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
it 1
requires 1
my 1
own 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
slow 1
to 1
perform 1
this 1
sacrifice 1
i 1
shall 1
quit 1
your 1
vessel 1
on 1
the 1
ice 1
raft 1
which 1
brought 1
me 1
thither 1
and 1
shall 1
seek 1
the 1
most 1
northern 1
extremity 1
of 1
the 1
globe 1
i 1
shall 1
collect 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
and 1
consume 1
to 1
ashes 1
this 1
miserable 1
frame 1
that 1
its 1
remains 1
may 1
afford 1
no 1
light 1
to 1
any 1
curious 1
and 1
unhallowed 1
wretch 1
who 1
would 1
create 1
such 1
another 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
i 1
shall 1
die 1
i 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
feel 1
the 1
agonies 1
which 1
now 1
consume 1
me 1
or 1
be 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
feelings 1
unsatisfied 1
yet 1
unquenched 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
who 1
called 1
me 1
into 1
being 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
very 1
remembrance 1
of 1
us 1
both 1
will 1
speedily 1
vanish 1
i 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
sun 1
or 1
stars 1
or 1
feel 1
the 1
winds 1
play 1
on 1
my 1
cheeks 1
light 1
feeling 1
and 1
sense 1
will 1
pass 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
condition 1
must 1
i 1
find 1
my 1
happiness 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
the 1
images 1
which 1
this 1
world 1
affords 1
first 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
cheering 1
warmth 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
rustling 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
the 1
warbling 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
these 1
were 1
all 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
wept 1
to 1
die 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
polluted 1
by 1
crimes 1
and 1
torn 1
by 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
where 1
can 1
i 1
find 1
rest 1
but 1
in 1
death 1
farewell 1
i 1
leave 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
you 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
humankind 1
whom 1
these 1
eyes 1
will 1
ever 1
behold 1
farewell 1
frankenstein 1
if 1
thou 1
wert 1
yet 1
alive 1
and 1
yet 1
cherished 1
a 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
against 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
satiated 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
in 1
my 1
destruction 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
thou 1
didst 1
seek 1
my 1
extinction 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
not 1
cause 1
greater 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
if 1
yet 1
in 1
some 1
mode 1
unknown 1
to 1
me 1
thou 1
hadst 1
not 1
ceased 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
feel 1
thou 1
wouldst 1
not 1
desire 1
against 1
me 1
a 1
vengeance 1
greater 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
feel 1
blasted 1
as 1
thou 1
wert 1
my 1
agony 1
was 1
still 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
for 1
the 1
bitter 1
sting 1
of 1
remorse 1
will 1
not 1
cease 1
to 1
rankle 1
in 1
my 1
wounds 1
until 1
death 1
shall 1
close 1
them 1
forever 1
but 1
soon 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
sad 1
and 1
solemn 1
enthusiasm 1
i 1
shall 1
die 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
felt 1
soon 1
these 1
burning 1
miseries 1
will 1
be 1
extinct 1
i 1
shall 1
ascend 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
triumphantly 1
and 1
exult 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
the 1
torturing 1
flames 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
that 1
conflagration 1
will 1
fade 1
away 1
my 1
ashes 1
will 1
be 1
swept 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
my 1
spirit 1
will 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
thinks 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
surely 1
think 1
thus 1
farewell 1

upon 1
