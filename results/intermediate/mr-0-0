by 1
the 1
way 1
lane 1
i 1
see 1
from 1
your 1
book 1
that 1
on 1
thursday 1
night 1
when 1
lord 1
shoreman 1
and 1
mr 1

were 1
dining 1
with 1
me 1
eight 1
bottles 1
of 1

having 1
been 1
consumed 1

sir 1
eight 1
bottles 1
and 1
a 1
pint 1
algernon 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
at 1
a 1
bachelors 1
establishment 1
the 1
servants 1
invariably 1
drink 1
the 1
champagne 1
i 1
ask 1
merely 1
for 1
information 1
lane 1
i 1
attribute 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
superior 1
quality 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
sir 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
observed 1
that 1
in 1
married 1
households 1
the 1
champagne 1
is 1
rarely 1
of 1
a 1
firstrate 1
brand 1
algernon 1
good 1
heavens 1
is 1
marriage 1
so 1
demoralising 1
as 1
that 1
lane 1
i 1
believe 1
it 1
_is_ 1
a 1
very 1
pleasant 1
state 1
sir 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
experience 1
of 1
it 1
myself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
married 1
once 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
a 1
misunderstanding 1
between 1
myself 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
person 1
algernon 1

i 1
dont 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
your 1
family 1
life 1
lane 1
lane 1
no 1
sir 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
interesting 1
subject 1
i 1
never 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
myself 1
algernon 1
very 1
natural 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
will 1

lax 1

the 1
lower 1
orders 1
dont 1
set 1
us 1
a 1
good 1
example 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
the 1

is 1
customary 1
in 1
good 1
society 1
to 1
take 1
some 1
slight 1
refreshment 1
at 1
five 1
oclock 1

excessively 1
boring 1
algernon 1

people 1
you 1
amuse 1
jack 1
airily__ 1

perfectly 1
horrid 1

immensely 1
you 1
must 1

course 1
hallo 1
why 1
all 1
these 1
cups 1
why 1
cucumber 1

why 1
such 1
reckless 1
extravagance 1
in 1
one 1
so 1
young 1
who 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
tea 1
algernon 1
oh 1
merely 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
and 1
gwendolen 1
jack 1
how 1
perfectly 1
delightful 1
algernon 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
wont 1
quite 1
approve 1
of 1
your 1
being 1
here 1
jack 1
may 1
i 1
ask 1
why 1
algernon 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
flirt 1
with 1
gwendolen 1
is 1
perfectly 1
disgraceful 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
the 1
way 1
gwendolen 1
flirts 1
with 1
you 1
jack 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
expressly 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
her 1
algernon 1
i 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
up 1
for 1
pleasure 1
i 1
call 1
that 1
business 1
jack 1
how 1
utterly 1
unromantic 1
you 1
are 1
algernon 1
i 1
really 1
dont 1
see 1
anything 1
romantic 1
in 1
proposing 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
romantic 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
romantic 1
about 1
a 1
definite 1
proposal 1
why 1
one 1
may 1
be 1
accepted 1
one 1
usually 1
is 1
i 1
believe 1
then 1
the 1
excitement 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
very 1
essence 1
of 1
romance 1
is 1
uncertainty 1
if 1
ever 1
i 1
get 1
married 1
ill 1
certainly 1
try 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
fact 1
jack 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
that 1
dear 1
algy 1
the 1
divorce 1
court 1
was 1
specially 1
invented 1
for 1
people 1
whose 1
memories 1
are 1
so 1
curiously 1
constituted 1
algernon 1
oh 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
speculating 1
on 1
that 1
subject 1

nonsense 1
algernon 1
it 1
isnt 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
truth 1
it 1
accounts 1
for 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
number 1
of 1
bachelors 1
that 1
one 1
sees 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1

whole 1
question 1
of 1

on 1

one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
cecily 1
enter 1
lane 1
algernon 1
bring 1
me 1
that 1
cigarette 1
case 1
mr 1
worthing 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
smoking 1
room 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
he 1
dined 1
here 1
lane 1
yes 1
sir 1
lane 1
goes 1
out 1
jack 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
you 1
had 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
writing 1
frantic 1
letters 1
to 1
scotland 1
yard 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
offering 1
a 1
large 1
reward 1
algernon 1
well 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
offer 1
one 1
i 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
hard 1
up 1
jack 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
offering 1
a 1
large 1
reward 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
found 1
enter 1
lane 1
with 1
the 1
cigarette 1
case 1
on 1
a 1
salver 1
algernon 1
takes 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
lane 1
goes 1
out 1
algernon 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
rather 1
mean 1
of 1
you 1
ernest 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
opens 1
case 1
and 1
examines 1
it 1
however 1
it 1
makes 1
no 1
matter 1
for 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
inscription 1
inside 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
isnt 1
yours 1
after 1
all 1
jack 1
of 1
course 1
its 1
mine 1
moving 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
me 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
right 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
read 1
what 1
is 1
written 1
inside 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
ungentlemanly 1
thing 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
private 1
cigarette 1
case 1
algernon 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
absurd 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
hard 1
and 1
fast 1
rule 1
about 1
what 1
one 1
should 1
read 1
and 1
what 1
one 1
shouldnt 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
of 1
modern 1
culture 1
depends 1
on 1
what 1
one 1
shouldnt 1
read 1
jack 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
and 1
i 1
dont 1
propose 1
to 1
discuss 1
modern 1
culture 1
it 1
isnt 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
one 1
should 1
talk 1
of 1
in 1
private 1
i 1
simply 1
want 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
back 1
algernon 1
yes 1
but 1
this 1
isnt 1
your 1
cigarette 1
case 1
this 1
cigarette 1
case 1
is 1
a 1
present 1
from 1
some 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
cecily 1
and 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
didnt 1
know 1

one 1
of 1

me 1
algy 1
algernon 1
retreating 1
to 1
back 1
of 1
sofa 1
but 1
why 1
does 1
she 1
call 1
herself 1
little 1
cecily 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
your 1
aunt 1
and 1
lives 1
at 1
tunbridge 1
wells 1
reading 1
from 1
little 1
cecily 1
with 1
her 1
fondest 1
love 1
jack 1
moving 1
to 1
sofa 1
and 1
kneeling 1
upon 1
it 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
there 1
in 1
that 1
some 1
aunts 1
are 1
tall 1
some 1
aunts 1
are 1
not 1
tall 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
surely 1
an 1
aunt 1
may 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
decide 1
for 1
herself 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
every 1
aunt 1
should 1
be 1
exactly 1
like 1
your 1
aunt 1
that 1
is 1
absurd 1
for 1
heavens 1
sake 1
give 1
me 1
back 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
follows 1
algernon 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
algernon 1
yes 1
but 1
why 1
does 1
your 1
aunt 1
call 1
you 1
her 1
uncle 1
from 1
little 1
cecily 1
with 1
her 1
fondest 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
dear 1
uncle 1
jack 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
objection 1
i 1
admit 1
to 1
an 1
aunt 1
being 1
a 1
small 1
aunt 1
but 1
why 1
an 1
aunt 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
her 1
size 1
may 1
be 1
should 1
call 1
her 1
own 1
nephew 1
her 1
uncle 1
i 1
cant 1
quite 1
make 1
out 1
besides 1
your 1
name 1
isnt 1
jack 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
ernest 1
jack 1

isnt 1
ernest 1
its 1
jack 1

have 1
introduced 1
you 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
as 1
ernest 1
you 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1

look 1
as 1
if 1
your 1
name 1

ernest 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
earnestlooking 1
person 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
it 1
is 1
perfectly 1
absurd 1
your 1
saying 1
that 1
your 1
name 1
isnt 1
ernest 1
its 1
on 1
your 1
cards 1
here 1

one 1
of 1

from 1
case 1
mr 1

worthing 1
b 1
4 1
the 1
albany 1
ill 1
keep 1
this 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
that 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
ernest 1
if 1
ever 1
you 1
attempt 1
to 1
deny 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
or 1
to 1
gwendolen 1
or 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
puts 1
the 1

his 1
pocket 1
jack 1
well 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
the 1
cigarette 1
case 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
algernon 1
yes 1
but 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
your 1
small 1
aunt 1
cecily 1
who 1
lives 1
at 1
tunbridge 1
wells 1
calls 1
you 1
her 1
dear 1
uncle 1
come 1
old 1
boy 1

had 1
much 1
better 1
have 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
jack 1
my 1
dear 1
algy 1
you 1
talk 1
exactly 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
dentist 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
vulgar 1
to 1
talk 1
like 1
a 1
dentist 1
when 1
one 1
isnt 1
a 1
dentist 1
it 1
produces 1
a 1
false 1
impression 1
algernon 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
dentists 1
always 1
do 1
now 1
go 1
on 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
i 1
may 1
mention 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
suspected 1
you 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
confirmed 1
and 1
secret 1
bunburyist 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
now 1
jack 1
bunburyist 1

on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
a 1
bunburyist 1
algernon 1
ill 1
reveal 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
that 1
incomparable 1
expression 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
inform 1
me 1
why 1
you 1
are 1
ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1

is 1
hands 1

produce 1
your 1
explanation 1
and 1
pray 1
make 1
it 1
improbable 1
sits 1
on 1
sofa 1
jack 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
improbable 1
about 1
my 1
explanation 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
fact 1
its 1
perfectly 1
ordinary 1
old 1
mr 1
thomas 1
cardew 1
who 1
adopted 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
boy 1
made 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
will 1
guardian 1
to 1
his 1
granddaughter 1
miss 1
cecily 1
cardew 1
cecily 1
who 1
addresses 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
uncle 1
from 1
motives 1
of 1
respect 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
appreciate 1
lives 1
at 1
my 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
under 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
her 1
admirable 1
governess 1
miss 1
prism 1
algernon 1
where 1
is 1
that 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
jack 1
that 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
you 1
dear 1
boy 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
invited 1
i 1
may 1
tell 1
you 1
candidly 1
that 1
the 1
place 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
shropshire 1
algernon 1
i 1
suspected 1
that 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
i 1
have 1
bunburyed 1
all 1
over 1
shropshire 1
on 1
two 1
separate 1
occasions 1
now 1
go 1
on 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
jack 1
my 1
dear 1
algy 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
whether 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
understand 1
my 1
real 1
motives 1
you 1
are 1
hardly 1
serious 1
enough 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
guardian 1
one 1
has 1
to 1
adopt 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
moral 1
tone 1
on 1
all 1
subjects 1
its 1
ones 1
duty 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
high 1
moral 1
tone 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
said 1
to 1
conduce 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
either 1
ones 1
health 1
or 1
ones 1
happiness 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
pretended 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
ernest 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
albany 1
and 1
gets 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
dreadful 1
scrapes 1
that 1
my 1
dear 1
algy 1
is 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
pure 1
and 1
simple 1
algernon 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
rarely 1
pure 1
and 1
never 1
simple 1
modern 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
tedious 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
either 1
and 1
modern 1
literature 1
a 1
complete 1
impossibility 1
jack 1
that 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
thing 1
algernon 1
literary 1
criticism 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
forte 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
dont 1
try 1
it 1
you 1
should 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
people 1
who 1
havent 1
been 1
at 1
a 1
university 1
they 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
daily 1
papers 1
what 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
is 1
a 1
bunburyist 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
saying 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
bunburyist 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
advanced 1
bunburyists 1
i 1
know 1
jack 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
algernon 1
you 1
have 1
invented 1
a 1
very 1
useful 1
younger 1
brother 1
called 1
ernest 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
you 1
like 1
i 1
have 1
invented 1
an 1
invaluable 1
permanent 1
invalid 1
called 1
bunbury 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
country 1
whenever 1
i 1
choose 1
bunbury 1
is 1
perfectly 1
invaluable 1
if 1
it 1
wasnt 1
for 1
bunburys 1
extraordinary 1
bad 1
health 1
for 1
instance 1
i 1
wouldnt 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
at 1
williss 1
to 1
night 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
really 1
engaged 1
to 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
week 1
jack 1
i 1
havent 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
anywhere 1
tonight 1
algernon 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
absurdly 1
careless 1
about 1
sending 1
out 1
invitations 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
foolish 1
of 1
you 1
nothing 1
annoys 1
people 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
not 1
receiving 1
invitations 1
jack 1
you 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
dine 1
with 1
your 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
algernon 1
i 1
havent 1
the 1
smallest 1
intention 1
of 1
doing 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
i 1
dined 1
there 1
on 1
monday 1
and 1
once 1
a 1
week 1
is 1
quite 1
enough 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
ones 1
own 1
relations 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
whenever 1
i 1
do 1
dine 1
there 1
i 1
am 1
always 1
treated 1
as 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
sent 1
down 1
with 1
either 1
no 1
woman 1
at 1
all 1
or 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
third 1
place 1
i 1
know 1
perfectly 1
well 1
whom 1
she 1
will 1
place 1
me 1
next 1
to 1
tonight 1
she 1
will 1
place 1
me 1
next 1
mary 1
farquhar 1
who 1
always 1
flirts 1
with 1
her 1
own 1
husband 1
across 1
the 1
dinnertable 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
very 1
pleasant 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
decent 1
and 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
is 1
enormously 1
on 1
the 1
increase 1
the 1
amount 1
of 1
women 1
in 1
london 1
who 1
flirt 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
husbands 1
is 1
perfectly 1
scandalous 1
it 1
looks 1
so 1
bad 1
it 1
is 1
simply 1
washing 1
ones 1
clean 1
linen 1
in 1
public 1
besides 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
confirmed 1
bunburyist 1
i 1
naturally 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
bunburying 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
rules 1
jack 1
im 1
not 1
a 1
bunburyist 1
at 1
all 1
if 1
gwendolen 1
accepts 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
kill 1
my 1
brother 1
indeed 1
i 1
think 1
ill 1
kill 1
him 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
cecily 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
bore 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
ernest 1
and 1
i 1
strongly 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
mr 1
with 1
your 1
invalid 1
friend 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
absurd 1
name 1
algernon 1
nothing 1
will 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
bunbury 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
get 1
married 1
which 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
extremely 1
problematic 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
know 1
bunbury 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
marries 1
without 1
knowing 1
bunbury 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
tedious 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
jack 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
if 1
i 1
marry 1
a 1
charming 1
girl 1
like 1
gwendolen 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
girl 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
marry 1
i 1
certainly 1
wont 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
bunbury 1
algernon 1
then 1
your 1
wife 1
will 1
you 1
dont 1
seem 1
to 1
realise 1
that 1
in 1
married 1
life 1
three 1
is 1
company 1
and 1
two 1
is 1
none 1
jack 1
sententiously 1
that 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
friend 1
is 1
the 1
theory 1
that 1
the 1
corrupt 1
french 1
drama 1
has 1
been 1
propounding 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
fifty 1
years 1
algernon 1
yes 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
happy 1
english 1
home 1
has 1
proved 1
in 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
jack 1
for 1
heavens 1
sake 1
dont 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
cynical 1
its 1
perfectly 1
easy 1
to 1
be 1
cynical 1
algernon 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
it 1
isnt 1
easy 1
to 1
be 1
anything 1
nowadays 1
theres 1
such 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
beastly 1
competition 1
about 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
an 1
electric 1
bell 1
is 1
heard 1
ah 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
only 1
relatives 1
or 1
creditors 1
ever 1
ring 1
in 1
that 1
wagnerian 1
manner 1
now 1
if 1
i 1
get 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
for 1
proposing 1
to 1
gwendolen 1
may 1
i 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
tonight 1
at 1
williss 1
jack 1
i 1
suppose 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
algernon 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
hate 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
about 1
meals 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
shallow 1
of 1
them 1
enter 1
lane 1

icy 1
coldness 1

i 1

about 1
there 1
being 1
no 1
cucumbers 1
not 1
even 1
for 1
ready 1
money 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
it 1
really 1
makes 1
no 1
matter 1
algernon 1
i 1
had 1
some 1
crumpets 1
with 1
lady 1
harbury 1
who 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
living 1
entirely 1
for 1
pleasure 1
now 1
algernon 1
i 1
hear 1
her 1
hair 1
has 1
turned 1
quite 1
gold 1
from 1
grief 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
it 1
certainly 1
has 1
changed 1
its 1
colour 1
from 1
what 1
cause 1
i 1
of 1
course 1
cannot 1
say 1
algernon 1
crosses 1
and 1
hands 1
tea 1
thank 1
you 1
ive 1
quite 1
a 1
treat 1
for 1
you 1
tonight 1
algernon 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
send 1
you 1
down 1
with 1
mary 1
farquhar 1
she 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
nice 1
woman 1
and 1
so 1
attentive 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
its 1
delightful 1
to 1
watch 1
them 1
algernon 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
dining 1
with 1
you 1
tonight 1
after 1
all 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
frowning 1
i 1
hope 1
not 1
algernon 1
it 1
would 1
put 1
my 1
table 1
completely 1
out 1
your 1
uncle 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
dine 1
upstairs 1
fortunately 1
he 1
is 1
accustomed 1
to 1
that 1
algernon 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
bore 1
and 1
i 1
need 1
hardly 1
say 1
a 1
terrible 1
disappointment 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
had 1
a 1
telegram 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
friend 1
bunbury 1
is 1
very 1
ill 1
again 1
exchanges 1
glances 1
with 1
jack 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
with 1
him 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
strange 1
this 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
seems 1
to 1
suffer 1
from 1
curiously 1
bad 1
health 1
algernon 1
yes 1
poor 1
bunbury 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
invalid 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
well 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
algernon 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
high 1
time 1
that 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
live 1
or 1
to 1
die 1
this 1
shillyshallying 1
with 1
the 1
question 1
is 1
absurd 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
approve 1
of 1
the 1
modern 1
sympathy 1
with 1
invalids 1
i 1
consider 1
it 1
morbid 1
illness 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
encouraged 1
in 1
others 1
health 1
is 1
the 1
primary 1
duty 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
am 1
always 1
telling 1
that 1
to 1
your 1
poor 1
uncle 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
seems 1
to 1
take 1
much 1
notice 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
any 1
improvement 1
in 1
his 1
ailment 1
goes 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
much 1
obliged 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
ask 1
mr 1
bunbury 1
from 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
kind 1
enough 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
relapse 1
on 1
saturday 1
for 1
i 1
rely 1
on 1
you 1
to 1
arrange 1
my 1
music 1
for 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
last 1
reception 1
and 1
one 1
wants 1
something 1
that 1
will 1
encourage 1
conversation 1
particularly 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
when 1
every 1
one 1
has 1
practically 1
said 1
whatever 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
which 1
in 1
most 1
cases 1
was 1
probably 1
not 1
much 1
algernon 1
ill 1
speak 1
to 1
bunbury 1
aunt 1
augusta 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
conscious 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
promise 1
you 1
hell 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
by 1
saturday 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
music 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difficulty 1
you 1
see 1
if 1
one 1
plays 1
good 1
music 1
people 1
dont 1
listen 1
and 1
if 1
one 1
plays 1
bad 1
music 1
people 1
dont 1
talk 1
but 1
ill 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
programme 1
ive 1
drawn 1
out 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
thank 1
you 1
algernon 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
of 1
you 1
rising 1
and 1
following 1
algernon 1
im 1
sure 1
the 1
programme 1
will 1
be 1
delightful 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
expurgations 1
french 1
songs 1
i 1
cannot 1
possibly 1
allow 1
people 1
always 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
improper 1
and 1
either 1
look 1
shocked 1
which 1
is 1
vulgar 1
or 1
laugh 1
which 1
is 1
worse 1
but 1
german 1
sounds 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
respectable 1
language 1
and 1
indeed 1
i 1
believe 1
is 1
so 1
gwendolen 1
you 1
will 1
accompany 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
certainly 1
mamma 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
and 1
algernon 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
musicroom 1
gwendolen 1
remains 1
behind 1
jack 1
charming 1
day 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
gwendolen 1
pray 1
dont 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
weather 1
mr 1
worthing 1
whenever 1
people 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
weather 1
i 1
always 1
feel 1
quite 1
certain 1
that 1
they 1
mean 1
something 1
else 1
and 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
so 1
nervous 1
jack 1
i 1
do 1
mean 1
something 1
else 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
thought 1
so 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
am 1
never 1
wrong 1
jack 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
take 1
advantage 1
of 1
lady 1
bracknells 1
temporary 1
absence 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
would 1
certainly 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
mamma 1
has 1
a 1
way 1
of 1
coming 1
back 1
suddenly 1
into 1
a 1
room 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
about 1
jack 1
nervously 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
i 1
have 1
admired 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
girl 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
met 1
since 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
well 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
wish 1
that 1
in 1
public 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
more 1
demonstrative 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
have 1
always 1
had 1
an 1
irresistible 1
fascination 1
even 1
before 1
i 1
met 1
you 1
i 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
indifferent 1
to 1
you 1
jack 1
looks 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
we 1
live 1
as 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
know 1
mr 1
worthing 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
ideals 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
constantly 1
mentioned 1
in 1
the 1
more 1
expensive 1
monthly 1
magazines 1
and 1
has 1
reached 1
the 1
provincial 1
pulpits 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
and 1
my 1
ideal 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
to 1
love 1
some 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
ernest 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
name 1
that 1
inspires 1
absolute 1
confidence 1
the 1
moment 1
algernon 1
first 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
called 1
ernest 1
i 1
knew 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
jack 1
you 1
really 1
love 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
gwendolen 1
passionately 1
jack 1
darling 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
how 1
happy 1
youve 1
made 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
my 1
own 1
ernest 1
jack 1
but 1
you 1
dont 1
really 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
couldnt 1
love 1
me 1
if 1
my 1
name 1
wasnt 1
ernest 1
gwendolen 1
but 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
ernest 1
jack 1
yes 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
supposing 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
else 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
couldnt 1
love 1
me 1
then 1
gwendolen 1
glibly 1
ah 1
that 1
is 1
clearly 1
a 1
metaphysical 1
speculation 1
and 1
like 1
most 1
metaphysical 1
speculations 1
has 1
very 1
little 1
reference 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
the 1
actual 1
facts 1
of 1
real 1
life 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
them 1
jack 1
personally 1
darling 1
to 1
speak 1
quite 1
candidly 1
i 1
dont 1
much 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
ernest 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
the 1
name 1
suits 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
gwendolen 1
it 1
suits 1
you 1
perfectly 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
divine 1
name 1
it 1
has 1
a 1
music 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
it 1
produces 1
vibrations 1
jack 1
well 1
really 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
there 1
are 1
lots 1
of 1
other 1
much 1
nicer 1
names 1
i 1
think 1
jack 1
for 1
instance 1
a 1
charming 1
name 1
gwendolen 1
jack 1
no 1
there 1
is 1
very 1
little 1
music 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
jack 1
if 1
any 1
at 1
all 1
indeed 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
thrill 1
it 1
produces 1
absolutely 1
no 1
vibrations 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
several 1
jacks 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
without 1
exception 1
were 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
plain 1
besides 1
jack 1
is 1
a 1
notorious 1
domesticity 1
for 1
john 1
and 1
i 1
pity 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
married 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
called 1
john 1
she 1
would 1
probably 1
never 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
entrancing 1
pleasure 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
moments 1
solitude 1
the 1
only 1
really 1
safe 1
name 1
is 1
ernest 1
jack 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
christened 1
at 1
oncei 1
mean 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
married 1
at 1
once 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
gwendolen 1
married 1
mr 1
worthing 1
jack 1
astounded 1
well 1
surely 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
believe 1
miss 1
fairfax 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
absolutely 1
indifferent 1
to 1
me 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
adore 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
havent 1
proposed 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
nothing 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
at 1
all 1
about 1
marriage 1
the 1
subject 1
has 1
not 1
even 1
been 1
touched 1
on 1
jack 1
well 1
may 1
i 1
propose 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
gwendolen 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
admirable 1
opportunity 1
and 1
to 1
spare 1
you 1
any 1
possible 1
disappointment 1
mr 1
worthing 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
quite 1
frankly 1
beforehand 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
fully 1
determined 1
to 1
accept 1
you 1
jack 1
gwendolen 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
mr 1
worthing 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
jack 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
but 1
you 1
dont 1
say 1
it 1
jack 1
gwendolen 1
will 1
you 1
marry 1
me 1
goes 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
gwendolen 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
will 1
darling 1
how 1
long 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
experience 1
in 1
how 1
to 1
propose 1
jack 1
my 1
own 1
one 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
loved 1
any 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
you 1
gwendolen 1
yes 1
but 1
men 1
often 1
propose 1
for 1
practice 1
i 1
know 1
my 1
brother 1
gerald 1
does 1
all 1
my 1
girlfriends 1
tell 1
me 1
so 1
what 1
wonderfully 1
blue 1
eyes 1
you 1
have 1
ernest 1
they 1
are 1
quite 1
quite 1
blue 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
especially 1
when 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
people 1

mr 1
worthing 1

tries 1
to 1

she 1
restrains 1
him 1

beg 1

pleasant 1

unpleasant 1

case 1

that 1
you 1

not 1

as 1
the 1
dear 1

we 1
work 1
together 1
in 1

however 1
i 1

quite 1
ready 1

enter 1

lady 1
bracknell 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
always 1
have 1
an 1
occupation 1
of 1
some 1
kind 1
there 1
are 1
far 1
too 1
many 1
idle 1
men 1
in 1
london 1

it 1
is 1
how 1
old 1
are 1
you 1
jack 1
twentynine 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
age 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
at 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
of 1
opinion 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
desires 1
to 1
get 1
married 1
should 1
know 1
either 1
everything 1
or 1
nothing 1
which 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
jack 1
after 1
some 1
hesitation 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
i 1
am 1
pleased 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
of 1
anything 1
that 1
tampers 1
with 1
natural 1
ignorance 1
ignorance 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
delicate 1
exotic 1
fruit 1

it 1
and 1
the 1
bloom 1
is 1
gone 1
the 1
whole 1
theory 1
of 1
modern 1
education 1
is 1
radically 1
unsound 1
fortunately 1
in 1
england 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
education 1
produces 1
no 1
effect 1
whatsoever 1
if 1
it 1
did 1
it 1
would 1
prove 1
a 1
serious 1
danger 1
to 1
the 1
upper 1
classes 1
and 1
probably 1
lead 1
to 1
acts 1
of 1
violence 1

thats 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
said 1
about 1
land 1
jack 1
i 1
have 1
a 1

with 1
some 1
land 1
of 1
course 1
attached 1
to 1
it 1
about 1
fifteen 1
hundred 1
acres 1
i 1
believe 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
depend 1
on 1
that 1
for 1
my 1
real 1

in 1

as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1

point 1
can 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
afterwards 1
you 1
have 1
a 1

i 1
hope 1
a 1
girl 1
with 1
a 1
simple 1
unspoiled 1
nature 1
like 1
gwendolen 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
expected 1

in 1
the 1

jack 1
well 1
i 1
own 1
a 1

my 1
parents 1
lady 1
bracknell 1
to 1
lose 1
one 1
parent 1
mr 1
worthing 1
may 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
misfortune 1
to 1
lose 1
both 1
looks 1
like 1
carelessness 1
who 1
was 1
your 1
father 1

a 1
man 1

some 1
wealth 1

born 1
in 1
what 1
the 1
radical 1
papers 1
call 1
the 1

were 1

cold 1

admirably 1

mind 1

was 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
reasoning 1
and 1
observing 1
machine 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
seen 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
lover 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
placed 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
false 1
position 1
he 1
never 1
spoke 1
of 1
the 1
softer 1
passions 1
save 1
with 1
a 1
gibe 1
and 1
a 1
sneer 1
they 1
were 1
admirable 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
observerexcellent 1
for 1
drawing 1
the 1
veil 1
from 1
mens 1
motives 1
and 1
actions 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
trained 1
reasoner 1
to 1
admit 1
such 1
intrusions 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
delicate 1
and 1
finely 1
adjusted 1
temperament 1
was 1
to 1
introduce 1
a 1
distracting 1
factor 1
which 1
might 1
throw 1
a 1
doubt 1
upon 1
all 1
his 1
mental 1
results 1
grit 1
in 1
a 1
sensitive 1
instrument 1
or 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
highpower 1
lenses 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
more 1
disturbing 1
than 1
a 1
strong 1
emotion 1
in 1
a 1
nature 1
such 1
as 1
his 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
woman 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
woman 1
was 1
the 1
late 1
irene 1
adler 1
of 1
dubious 1
and 1
questionable 1
memory 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
little 1
of 1
holmes 1
lately 1
my 1
marriage 1
had 1
drifted 1
us 1
away 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
my 1
own 1
complete 1
happiness 1
and 1
the 1
homecentred 1
interests 1
which 1
rise 1
up 1
around 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
first 1
finds 1
himself 1
master 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
establishment 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
absorb 1
all 1
my 1
attention 1
while 1
holmes 1
who 1
loathed 1
every 1
form 1
of 1
society 1
with 1
his 1
whole 1
bohemian 1
soul 1
remained 1
in 1
our 1
lodgings 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
buried 1
among 1
his 1
old 1
books 1
and 1
alternating 1
from 1
week 1
to 1
week 1
between 1
cocaine 1
and 1
ambition 1
the 1
drowsiness 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
and 1
the 1
fierce 1
energy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
keen 1
nature 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
as 1
ever 1
deeply 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
crime 1
and 1
occupied 1
his 1
immense 1
faculties 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
powers 1
of 1
observation 1
in 1
following 1
out 1
those 1
clues 1
and 1
clearing 1
up 1
those 1
mysteries 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
abandoned 1
as 1
hopeless 1
by 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
i 1
heard 1
some 1
vague 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
doings 1
of 1
his 1
summons 1
to 1
odessa 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
trepoff 1
murder 1
of 1
his 1
clearing 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
tragedy 1
of 1
the 1
atkinson 1
brothers 1
at 1
trincomalee 1
and 1
finally 1
of 1
the 1
mission 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
accomplished 1
so 1
delicately 1
and 1
successfully 1
for 1
the 1
reigning 1
family 1
of 1
holland 1
beyond 1
these 1
signs 1
of 1
his 1
activity 1
however 1
which 1
i 1
merely 1
shared 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
readers 1
of 1
the 1
daily 1
press 1
i 1
knew 1
little 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
friend 1
and 1
companion 1

nightit 1

on 1
the 1

1888i 1
was 1
returning 1
from 1
a 1
journey 1
to 1
a 1
patient 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
returned 1
to 1
civil 1
practice 1
when 1
my 1
way 1
led 1
me 1
through 1
baker 1
street 1
as 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
wellremembered 1
door 1
which 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
associated 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
my 1
wooing 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
incidents 1
of 1
the 1
study 1
in 1
scarlet 1
i 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
a 1
keen 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
holmes 1
again 1
and 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
employing 1
his 1
extraordinary 1
powers 1
his 1
rooms 1
were 1
brilliantly 1
lit 1
and 1
even 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
up 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
tall 1
spare 1
figure 1
pass 1
twice 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
silhouette 1
against 1
the 1
blind 1
he 1
was 1
pacing 1
the 1
room 1
swiftly 1
eagerly 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
clasped 1
behind 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
who 1
knew 1
his 1
every 1
mood 1
and 1
habit 1
his 1
attitude 1
and 1
manner 1
told 1
their 1
own 1
story 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
again 1
he 1
had 1
risen 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
drugcreated 1
dreams 1
and 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
some 1
new 1
problem 1
i 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
was 1
shown 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
which 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
in 1
part 1
my 1
own 1
his 1
manner 1
was 1
not 1
effusive 1
it 1
seldom 1
was 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
i 1
think 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
with 1
hardly 1
a 1
word 1
spoken 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
kindly 1
eye 1
he 1
waved 1
me 1
to 1
an 1
armchair 1
threw 1
across 1
his 1
case 1
of 1
cigars 1
and 1
indicated 1
a 1
spirit 1
case 1
and 1
a 1
gasogene 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
looked 1
me 1
over 1
in 1
his 1
singular 1
introspective 1
fashion 1
wedlock 1
suits 1
you 1
he 1
remarked 1
i 1
think 1
watson 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
put 1
on 1
seven 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
pounds 1
since 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
seven 1
i 1
answered 1
indeed 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
just 1
a 1
trifle 1
more 1
i 1
fancy 1
watson 1
and 1
in 1
practice 1
again 1
i 1
observe 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
intended 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
harness 1
then 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
i 1
deduce 1
it 1
how 1
do 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
getting 1
yourself 1
very 1
wet 1
lately 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
most 1
clumsy 1
and 1
careless 1
servant 1
girl 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes 1
said 1
i 1
this 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
you 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
been 1
burned 1
had 1
you 1
lived 1
a 1
few 1
centuries 1
ago 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
country 1
walk 1
on 1
thursday 1
and 1
came 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
dreadful 1
mess 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
changed 1
my 1
clothes 1
i 1
cant 1
imagine 1
how 1
you 1
deduce 1
it 1
as 1
to 1
mary 1
jane 1
she 1
is 1
incorrigible 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
has 1
given 1
her 1
notice 1
but 1
there 1
again 1
i 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
you 1
work 1
it 1
out 1
he 1
chuckled 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
long 1
nervous 1
hands 1
together 1
it 1
is 1
simplicity 1
itself 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
eyes 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
your 1
left 1
shoe 1
just 1
where 1
the 1
firelight 1
strikes 1
it 1
the 1
leather 1
is 1
scored 1
by 1
six 1
almost 1
parallel 1
cuts 1
obviously 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
caused 1
by 1
someone 1
who 1
has 1
very 1
carelessly 1
scraped 1
round 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
sole 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
remove 1
crusted 1
mud 1
from 1
it 1
hence 1
you 1
see 1
my 1
double 1
deduction 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
in 1
vile 1
weather 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
particularly 1
malignant 1
bootslitting 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
london 1
slavey 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
practice 1
if 1
a 1
gentleman 1
walks 1
into 1
my 1
rooms 1
smelling 1
of 1
iodoform 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
mark 1
of 1
nitrate 1
of 1
silver 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
forefinger 1
and 1
a 1
bulge 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
tophat 1
to 1
show 1
where 1
he 1
has 1
secreted 1
his 1
stethoscope 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
dull 1
indeed 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
pronounce 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
active 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
medical 1
profession 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
ease 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
explained 1
his 1
process 1
of 1
deduction 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
you 1
give 1
your 1
reasons 1
i 1
remarked 1
the 1
thing 1
always 1
appears 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
ridiculously 1
simple 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
easily 1
do 1
it 1
myself 1
though 1
at 1
each 1
successive 1
instance 1
of 1
your 1
reasoning 1
i 1
am 1
baffled 1
until 1
you 1
explain 1
your 1
process 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
my 1
eyes 1
are 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
yours 1
quite 1
so 1
he 1
answered 1
lighting 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
throwing 1
himself 1
down 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
observe 1
the 1
distinction 1
is 1
clear 1
for 1
example 1
you 1
have 1
frequently 1
seen 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
lead 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
to 1
this 1
room 1
frequently 1
how 1
often 1
well 1
some 1
hundreds 1
of 1
times 1
then 1
how 1
many 1
are 1
there 1
how 1
many 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
quite 1
so 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
observed 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
that 1
is 1
just 1
my 1
point 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
seventeen 1
steps 1
because 1
i 1
have 1
both 1
seen 1
and 1
observed 1
bytheway 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
interested 1
in 1
these 1
little 1
problems 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
chronicle 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
trifling 1
experiences 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
he 1
threw 1
over 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
thick 1
pinktinted 1
notepaper 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
open 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
it 1
came 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
post 1
said 1
he 1
read 1
it 1
aloud 1
the 1
note 1
was 1
undated 1
and 1
without 1
either 1
signature 1
or 1
address 1
there 1
will 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
tonight 1
at 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
eight 1
oclock 1
it 1
said 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
desires 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
upon 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
deepest 1
moment 1
your 1
recent 1
services 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
royal 1
houses 1
of 1
europe 1
have 1
shown 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
who 1
may 1
safely 1
be 1
trusted 1
with 1
matters 1
which 1
are 1
of 1
an 1
importance 1
which 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
exaggerated 1
this 1
account 1
of 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
from 1
all 1
quarters 1
received 1
be 1
in 1
your 1
chamber 1
then 1
at 1
that 1
hour 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
amiss 1
if 1
your 1
visitor 1
wear 1
a 1
mask 1
this 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
mystery 1
i 1
remarked 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
it 1
means 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
data 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
capital 1
mistake 1
to 1
theorize 1
before 1
one 1
has 1
data 1
insensibly 1
one 1
begins 1
to 1
twist 1
facts 1
to 1
suit 1
theories 1
instead 1
of 1
theories 1
to 1
suit 1
facts 1
but 1
the 1
note 1
itself 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
from 1
it 1
i 1
carefully 1
examined 1
the 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
upon 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
written 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
wrote 1
it 1
was 1
presumably 1
well 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
remarked 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
imitate 1
my 1
companions 1
processes 1
such 1
paper 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
bought 1
under 1
half 1
a 1
crown 1
a 1
packet 1
it 1
is 1
peculiarly 1
strong 1
and 1
stiff 1
peculiarthat 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
word 1
said 1
holmes 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
english 1
paper 1
at 1
all 1
hold 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
large 1

woven 1
into 1
the 1
texture 1
of 1
the 1

what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
asked 1
holmes 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
maker 1
no 1
doubt 1
or 1
his 1
monogram 1

not 1

which 1
is 1

a 1
customary 1
contraction 1

our 1

us 1

as 1

the 1
scene 1

its 1
numerous 1

ha 1
ha 1
my 1
boy 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
blue 1
triumphant 1
cloud 1
from 1
his 1
cigarette 1
the 1
paper 1
was 1
made 1
in 1

said 1
precisely 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
wrote 1
the 1

a 1
german 1
do 1
you 1
note 1
the 1
peculiar 1
construction 1
of 1
the 1
sentencethis 1
account 1
of 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
from 1
all 1
quarters 1
received 1
a 1
frenchman 1
or 1
russian 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
written 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
german 1
who 1
is 1
so 1
uncourteous 1
to 1
his 1
verbs 1
it 1
only 1
remains 1
therefore 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
is 1
wanted 1
by 1
this 1
german 1
who 1
writes 1
upon 1
bohemian 1
paper 1
and 1
prefers 1
wearing 1
a 1
mask 1
to 1
showing 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
here 1
he 1
comes 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
mistaken 1
to 1
resolve 1
all 1
our 1
doubts 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
sharp 1
sound 1
of 1
horses 1
hoofs 1
and 1
grating 1
wheels 1
against 1
the 1
curb 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
sharp 1
pull 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
holmes 1
whistled 1
a 1
pair 1
by 1
the 1
sound 1
said 1
he 1
yes 1
he 1
continued 1
glancing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
a 1
nice 1
little 1
brougham 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
beauties 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
apiece 1
theres 1
money 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
watson 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
else 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
holmes 1
not 1
a 1
bit 1
doctor 1
stay 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
i 1
am 1
lost 1
without 1
my 1
boswell 1
and 1
this 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
interesting 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pity 1
to 1
miss 1
it 1
but 1
your 1
client 1
never 1
mind 1
him 1
i 1
may 1
want 1
your 1
help 1
and 1
so 1
may 1
he 1
here 1
he 1
comes 1
sit 1
down 1
in 1
that 1
armchair 1
doctor 1
and 1
give 1
us 1
your 1
best 1
attention 1
a 1
slow 1
and 1
heavy 1
step 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
heard 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
paused 1
immediately 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
authoritative 1
tap 1
come 1
in 1
said 1
holmes 1
a 1
man 1
entered 1
who 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
less 1
than 1
six 1
feet 1
six 1
inches 1
in 1
height 1
with 1
the 1
chest 1
and 1
limbs 1
of 1
a 1
hercules 1
his 1
dress 1
was 1
rich 1
with 1
a 1
richness 1
which 1
would 1
in 1
england 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
akin 1
to 1
bad 1
taste 1
heavy 1
bands 1
of 1
astrakhan 1
were 1
slashed 1
across 1
the 1
sleeves 1
and 1
fronts 1
of 1
his 1
doublebreasted 1
coat 1
while 1
the 1
deep 1
blue 1
cloak 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
was 1
lined 1
with 1
flamecoloured 1
silk 1
and 1
secured 1
at 1
the 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
brooch 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
flaming 1
beryl 1
boots 1
which 1
extended 1
halfway 1
up 1
his 1
calves 1
and 1
which 1
were 1
trimmed 1
at 1
the 1
tops 1
with 1
rich 1
brown 1
fur 1
completed 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
barbaric 1
opulence 1
which 1
was 1
suggested 1
by 1
his 1
whole 1
appearance 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
broadbrimmed 1
hat 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
while 1
he 1
wore 1
across 1
the 1
upper 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
extending 1
down 1
past 1
the 1
cheekbones 1
a 1
black 1
vizard 1
mask 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
apparently 1
adjusted 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
for 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
still 1
raised 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
from 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
strong 1
character 1
with 1
a 1
thick 1
hanging 1
lip 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
straight 1
chin 1
suggestive 1
of 1
resolution 1
pushed 1
to 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
obstinacy 1
you 1
had 1
my 1
note 1
he 1
asked 1
with 1
a 1
deep 1
harsh 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
strongly 1
marked 1
german 1
accent 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
call 1
he 1
looked 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
as 1
if 1
uncertain 1
which 1
to 1
address 1
pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
said 1
holmes 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
dr 1
watson 1
who 1
is 1
occasionally 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
cases 1
whom 1
have 1
i 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
address 1
you 1
may 1
address 1
me 1
as 1
the 1
count 1
von 1
kramm 1
a 1
bohemian 1
nobleman 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
this 1
gentleman 1
your 1
friend 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
discretion 1
whom 1
i 1
may 1
trust 1
with 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
extreme 1
importance 1
if 1
not 1
i 1
should 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
alone 1
i 1
rose 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
holmes 1
caught 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
wrist 1
and 1
pushed 1
me 1
back 1
into 1
my 1
chair 1
it 1
is 1
both 1
or 1
none 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
before 1
this 1
gentleman 1
anything 1
which 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
count 1
shrugged 1
his 1
broad 1
shoulders 1
then 1
i 1
must 1
begin 1
said 1
he 1
by 1
binding 1
you 1
both 1
to 1
absolute 1
secrecy 1
for 1
two 1
years 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
that 1
time 1
the 1
matter 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
at 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
such 1
weight 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
an 1
influence 1
upon 1
european 1
history 1
i 1
promise 1
said 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
this 1
mask 1
continued 1
our 1
strange 1
visitor 1
the 1
august 1
person 1
who 1
employs 1
me 1
wishes 1
his 1
agent 1
to 1
be 1
unknown 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
confess 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
the 1
title 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
called 1
myself 1
is 1
not 1
exactly 1
my 1
own 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
holmes 1
dryly 1
the 1
circumstances 1
are 1
of 1
great 1
delicacy 1
and 1
every 1
precaution 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
to 1
quench 1
what 1
might 1
grow 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
immense 1
scandal 1
and 1
seriously 1
compromise 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
reigning 1
families 1
of 1
europe 1
to 1
speak 1
plainly 1
the 1
matter 1
implicates 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
of 1
ormstein 1
hereditary 1
kings 1
of 1
bohemia 1
i 1
was 1
also 1
aware 1
of 1
that 1
murmured 1
holmes 1
settling 1
himself 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
closing 1
his 1
eyes 1
our 1
visitor 1
glanced 1
with 1
some 1
apparent 1
surprise 1
at 1
the 1
languid 1
lounging 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
doubt 1
depicted 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
incisive 1
reasoner 1
and 1
most 1
energetic 1
agent 1
in 1
europe 1
holmes 1
slowly 1
reopened 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
impatiently 1
at 1
his 1
gigantic 1
client 1
if 1
your 1
majesty 1
would 1
condescend 1
to 1
state 1
your 1
case 1
he 1
remarked 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
better 1
able 1
to 1
advise 1
you 1
the 1
man 1
sprang 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
uncontrollable 1
agitation 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
desperation 1
he 1
tore 1
the 1
mask 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
hurled 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
he 1
cried 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
king 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
attempt 1
to 1
conceal 1
it 1
why 1
indeed 1
murmured 1
holmes 1
your 1
majesty 1
had 1
not 1
spoken 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
addressing 1
wilhelm 1
gottsreich 1
sigismond 1
von 1
ormstein 1
grand 1
duke 1
of 1
casselfelstein 1
and 1
hereditary 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
said 1
our 1
strange 1
visitor 1
sitting 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
passing 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
high 1
white 1
forehead 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
accustomed 1
to 1
doing 1
such 1
business 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
person 1
yet 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
so 1
delicate 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
confide 1
it 1
to 1
an 1
agent 1
without 1
putting 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
incognito 1
from 1
prague 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
consulting 1
you 1
then 1
pray 1
consult 1
said 1
holmes 1
shutting 1
his 1
eyes 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
briefly 1
these 1
some 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
during 1
a 1
lengthy 1
visit 1
to 1
warsaw 1
i 1
made 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
wellknown 1
adventuress 1
irene 1
adler 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
kindly 1
look 1
her 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
index 1
doctor 1
murmured 1
holmes 1
without 1
opening 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
adopted 1
a 1
system 1
of 1
docketing 1
all 1
paragraphs 1
concerning 1
men 1
and 1
things 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
name 1
a 1
subject 1
or 1
a 1
person 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
once 1
furnish 1
information 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
i 1
found 1
her 1
biography 1
sandwiched 1
in 1
between 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
hebrew 1
rabbi 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
staffcommander 1
who 1
had 1
written 1
a 1
monograph 1
upon 1
the 1
deepsea 1
fishes 1
let 1
me 1

so 1
your 1
majesty 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
became 1
entangled 1
with 1
this 1
young 1
person 1
wrote 1
her 1
some 1
compromising 1
letters 1
and 1
is 1
now 1
desirous 1
of 1
getting 1
those 1
letters 1
back 1
precisely 1
so 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
there 1
a 1

none 1
no 1

none 1
then 1
i 1

if 1
this 1
young 1

should 1
produce 1
her 1

for 1

or 1
other 1
purposes 1
how 1

we 1
were 1
both 1
in 1
the 1
photograph 1
oh 1
dear 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
bad 1
your 1
majesty 1
has 1
indeed 1
committed 1
an 1
indiscretion 1
i 1
was 1
madinsane 1
you 1
have 1
compromised 1
yourself 1
seriously 1
i 1
was 1
only 1
crown 1
prince 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
young 1
i 1
am 1
but 1
thirty 1
now 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
recovered 1
we 1
have 1
tried 1
and 1
failed 1
your 1
majesty 1
must 1
pay 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
bought 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
sell 1

then 1
five 1
attempts 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
twice 1

in 1
my 1

she 1
has 1
been 1
waylaid 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
result 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
it 1
absolutely 1
none 1
holmes 1
laughed 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
pretty 1
little 1
problem 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
one 1
to 1
me 1
returned 1
the 1
king 1
reproachfully 1
very 1
indeed 1
and 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
photograph 1
to 1
ruin 1
me 1
but 1
how 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
so 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
to 1
clotilde 1
lothman 1
von 1
saxemeningen 1
second 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
scandinavia 1
you 1
may 1
know 1
the 1
strict 1
principles 1
of 1
her 1
family 1
she 1
is 1
herself 1
the 1
very 1
soul 1
of 1
delicacy 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
conduct 1
would 1
bring 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
irene 1
adler 1
threatens 1
to 1
send 1
them 1
the 1
photograph 1
and 1
she 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
soul 1
of 1
steel 1
she 1
has 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
of 1
women 1
and 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
resolute 1
of 1
men 1
rather 1
than 1
i 1
should 1
marry 1
another 1
woman 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
lengths 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
gonone 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
not 1
sent 1
it 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
and 1
why 1
because 1
she 1
has 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
send 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
betrothal 1
was 1
publicly 1
proclaimed 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
next 1
monday 1
oh 1
then 1
we 1
have 1
three 1
days 1
yet 1
said 1
holmes 1
with 1
a 1
yawn 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
fortunate 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
matters 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
your 1
majesty 1
will 1
of 1
course 1
stay 1
in 1
london 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
certainly 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
langham 1
under 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
count 1
von 1
kramm 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
drop 1
you 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
we 1
progress 1
pray 1
do 1
so 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
all 1
anxiety 1
then 1
as 1
to 1
money 1
you 1
have 1
carte 1
blanche 1
absolutely 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
provinces 1
of 1
my 1
kingdom 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
photograph 1
and 1
for 1
present 1
expenses 1
the 1
king 1
took 1
a 1
heavy 1
chamois 1
leather 1
bag 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
cloak 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
in 1
gold 1
and 1
seven 1
hundred 1
in 1
notes 1
he 1
said 1
holmes 1
scribbled 1
a 1
receipt 1
upon 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
his 1
notebook 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
mademoiselles 1
address 1
he 1
asked 1
is 1
briony 1
lodge 1
serpentine 1
avenue 1
st 1
johns 1
wood 1
holmes 1
took 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
it 1
one 1
other 1
question 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
photograph 1
a 1
cabinet 1
it 1
was 1
then 1
goodnight 1
your 1
majesty 1
and 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
some 1
good 1
news 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
goodnight 1
watson 1
he 1
added 1
as 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
the 1
royal 1
brougham 1
rolled 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
call 1
tomorrow 1
afternoon 1
at 1
three 1
oclock 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
chat 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
over 1
with 1
you 1
ii 1
at 1
three 1
oclock 1
precisely 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
but 1
holmes 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
returned 1
the 1
landlady 1
informed 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
shortly 1
after 1
eight 1
oclock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
fire 1
however 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
awaiting 1
him 1
however 1
long 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
i 1
was 1
already 1
deeply 1
interested 1
in 1
his 1
inquiry 1
for 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
surrounded 1
by 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
grim 1
and 1
strange 1
features 1
which 1
were 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
two 1
crimes 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
recorded 1
still 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
the 1
exalted 1
station 1
of 1
his 1
client 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
character 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
indeed 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
on 1
hand 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
masterly 1
grasp 1
of 1
a 1
situation 1
and 1
his 1
keen 1
incisive 1
reasoning 1
which 1
made 1
it 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
study 1
his 1
system 1
of 1
work 1
and 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
quick 1
subtle 1
methods 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
disentangled 1
the 1
most 1
inextricable 1
mysteries 1
so 1
accustomed 1
was 1
i 1
to 1
his 1
invariable 1
success 1
that 1
the 1
very 1
possibility 1
of 1
his 1
failing 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
my 1
head 1
it 1
was 1
close 1
upon 1
four 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
drunkenlooking 1
groom 1
illkempt 1
and 1
sidewhiskered 1
with 1
an 1
inflamed 1
face 1
and 1
disreputable 1
clothes 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
accustomed 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
my 1
friends 1
amazing 1
powers 1
in 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
disguises 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
look 1
three 1
times 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
certain 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
nod 1
he 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
whence 1
he 1
emerged 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
tweedsuited 1
and 1
respectable 1
as 1
of 1
old 1
putting 1
his 1
hands 1
into 1
his 1
pockets 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
legs 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
well 1
really 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
choked 1
and 1
laughed 1
again 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
lie 1
back 1
limp 1
and 1
helpless 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
its 1
quite 1
too 1
funny 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
could 1
never 1
guess 1
how 1
i 1
employed 1
my 1
morning 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
ended 1
by 1
doing 1
i 1
cant 1
imagine 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
watching 1
the 1
habits 1
and 1
perhaps 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
miss 1
irene 1
adler 1
quite 1
so 1
but 1
the 1
sequel 1
was 1
rather 1
unusual 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
however 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
eight 1
oclock 1
this 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
a 1
groom 1
out 1
of 1
work 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
sympathy 1
and 1
freemasonry 1
among 1
horsey 1
men 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
know 1
i 1
soon 1
found 1
briony 1
lodge 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
bijou 1
villa 1
with 1
a 1
garden 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
but 1
built 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
road 1
two 1
stories 1
chubb 1
lock 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
large 1
sittingroom 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
well 1
furnished 1
with 1
long 1
windows 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
those 1
preposterous 1
english 1
window 1
fasteners 1
which 1
a 1
child 1
could 1
open 1
behind 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
save 1
that 1
the 1
passage 1
window 1
could 1
be 1
reached 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
coachhouse 1
i 1
walked 1
round 1
it 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
closely 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
without 1
noting 1
anything 1
else 1
of 1
interest 1
i 1
then 1
lounged 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
found 1
as 1
i 1
expected 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mews 1
in 1
a 1
lane 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
by 1
one 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
i 1
lent 1
the 1
ostlers 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
rubbing 1
down 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
received 1
in 1
exchange 1
twopence 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
half 1
and 1
half 1
two 1
fills 1
of 1
shag 1
tobacco 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
information 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
desire 1
about 1
miss 1
adler 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
other 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
in 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
interested 1
but 1
whose 1
biographies 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
and 1
what 1
of 1
irene 1
adler 1
i 1
asked 1
oh 1
she 1
has 1
turned 1
all 1
the 1
mens 1
heads 1
down 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
daintiest 1
thing 1
under 1
a 1
bonnet 1
on 1
this 1
planet 1
so 1
say 1
the 1
serpentinemews 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
she 1
lives 1
quietly 1
sings 1
at 1
concerts 1
drives 1
out 1
at 1
five 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
returns 1
at 1
seven 1
sharp 1
for 1
dinner 1
seldom 1
goes 1
out 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
except 1
when 1
she 1
sings 1
has 1
only 1
one 1
male 1
visitor 1
but 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
is 1
dark 1
handsome 1
and 1
dashing 1
never 1
calls 1
less 1
than 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
often 1
twice 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
mr 1
godfrey 1
norton 1
of 1
the 1
inner 1
temple 1
see 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
a 1
cabman 1
as 1
a 1
confidant 1
they 1
had 1
driven 1
him 1
home 1
a 1
dozen 1
times 1
from 1
serpentinemews 1
and 1
knew 1
all 1
about 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
all 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
near 1
briony 1
lodge 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
to 1
think 1
over 1
my 1
plan 1
of 1
campaign 1
this 1
godfrey 1
norton 1
was 1
evidently 1
an 1
important 1
factor 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lawyer 1
that 1
sounded 1
ominous 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
relation 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
what 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
repeated 1
visits 1
was 1
she 1
his 1
client 1
his 1
friend 1
or 1
his 1
mistress 1
if 1
the 1
former 1
she 1
had 1
probably 1
transferred 1
the 1
photograph 1
to 1
his 1
keeping 1
if 1
the 1
latter 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
likely 1
on 1
the 1
issue 1
of 1
this 1
question 1
depended 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
continue 1
my 1
work 1
at 1
briony 1
lodge 1
or 1
turn 1
my 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
gentlemans 1
chambers 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
delicate 1
point 1
and 1
it 1
widened 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
my 1
inquiry 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
i 1
bore 1
you 1
with 1
these 1
details 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
you 1
see 1
my 1
little 1
difficulties 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
situation 1
i 1
am 1
following 1
you 1
closely 1
i 1
answered 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
balancing 1
the 1
matter 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
a 1
hansom 1
cab 1
drove 1
up 1
to 1
briony 1
lodge 1
and 1
a 1
gentleman 1
sprang 1
out 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
remarkably 1
handsome 1
man 1
dark 1
aquiline 1
and 1
moustachedevidently 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
shouted 1
to 1
the 1
cabman 1
to 1
wait 1
and 1
brushed 1
past 1
the 1
maid 1
who 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
thoroughly 1
at 1
home 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
catch 1
glimpses 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
pacing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
talking 1
excitedly 1
and 1
waving 1
his 1
arms 1
of 1
her 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
nothing 1
presently 1
he 1
emerged 1
looking 1
even 1
more 1
flurried 1
than 1
before 1
as 1
he 1
stepped 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
he 1
pulled 1
a 1
gold 1
watch 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
earnestly 1
drive 1
like 1
the 1
devil 1
he 1
shouted 1
first 1
to 1
gross 1
hankeys 1
in 1
regent 1
street 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
st 1
monica 1
in 1
the 1
edgeware 1
road 1
half 1
a 1
guinea 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
just 1
wondering 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
do 1
well 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
when 1
up 1
the 1
lane 1
came 1
a 1
neat 1
little 1
landau 1
the 1
coachman 1
with 1
his 1
coat 1
only 1
halfbuttoned 1
and 1
his 1
tie 1
under 1
his 1
ear 1
while 1
all 1
the 1
tags 1
of 1
his 1
harness 1
were 1
sticking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
buckles 1
it 1
hadnt 1
pulled 1
up 1
before 1
she 1
shot 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
and 1
into 1
it 1
i 1
only 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
die 1
for 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
st 1
monica 1
john 1
she 1
cried 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
sovereign 1
if 1
you 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
this 1
was 1
quite 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
lose 1
watson 1
i 1
was 1
just 1
balancing 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
run 1
for 1
it 1
or 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
perch 1
behind 1
her 1
landau 1
when 1
a 1
cab 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
street 1
the 1
driver 1
looked 1
twice 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
shabby 1
fare 1
but 1
i 1
jumped 1
in 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
object 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
st 1
monica 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
sovereign 1
if 1
you 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
it 1
was 1
twentyfive 1
minutes 1
to 1
twelve 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
enough 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
my 1
cabby 1
drove 1
fast 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
i 1
ever 1
drove 1
faster 1
but 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
there 1
before 1
us 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
the 1
landau 1
with 1
their 1
steaming 1
horses 1
were 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
i 1
paid 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
hurried 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
there 1
save 1
the 1
two 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
surpliced 1
clergyman 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
expostulating 1
with 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
three 1
standing 1
in 1
a 1
knot 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
altar 1
i 1
lounged 1
up 1
the 1
side 1
aisle 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
idler 1
who 1
has 1
dropped 1
into 1
a 1
church 1
suddenly 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
the 1
three 1
at 1
the 1
altar 1
faced 1
round 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
godfrey 1
norton 1
came 1
running 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
towards 1
me 1
thank 1
god 1
he 1
cried 1
youll 1
do 1
come 1
come 1
what 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
come 1
man 1
come 1
only 1
three 1
minutes 1
or 1
it 1
wont 1
be 1
legal 1
i 1
was 1
halfdragged 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
and 1
before 1
i 1
knew 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
mumbling 1
responses 1
which 1
were 1
whispered 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
and 1
vouching 1
for 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
knew 1
nothing 1
and 1
generally 1
assisting 1
in 1
the 1
secure 1
tying 1
up 1
of 1
irene 1
adler 1
spinster 1
to 1
godfrey 1
norton 1
bachelor 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
done 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
gentleman 1
thanking 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
lady 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
while 1
the 1
clergyman 1
beamed 1
on 1
me 1
in 1
front 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
preposterous 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
ever 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
started 1
me 1
laughing 1
just 1
now 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
informality 1
about 1
their 1
license 1
that 1
the 1
clergyman 1
absolutely 1
refused 1
to 1
marry 1
them 1
without 1
a 1
witness 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
and 1
that 1
my 1
lucky 1
appearance 1
saved 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
from 1
having 1
to 1
sally 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
a 1
best 1
man 1
the 1
bride 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sovereign 1
and 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
wear 1
it 1
on 1
my 1
watchchain 1
in 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
occasion 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
unexpected 1
turn 1
of 1
affairs 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
what 1
then 1
well 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
plans 1
very 1
seriously 1
menaced 1
it 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
pair 1
might 1
take 1
an 1
immediate 1
departure 1
and 1
so 1
necessitate 1
very 1
prompt 1
and 1
energetic 1
measures 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
at 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
however 1
they 1
separated 1
he 1
driving 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
temple 1
and 1
she 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
i 1
shall 1
drive 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
at 1
five 1
as 1
usual 1
she 1
said 1
as 1
she 1
left 1
him 1
i 1
heard 1
no 1
more 1
they 1
drove 1
away 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
own 1
arrangements 1
which 1
are 1
some 1
cold 1
beef 1
and 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
beer 1
he 1
answered 1
ringing 1
the 1
bell 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
too 1
busy 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
busier 1
still 1
this 1
evening 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
doctor 1
i 1
shall 1
want 1
your 1
cooperation 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
delighted 1
you 1
dont 1
mind 1
breaking 1
the 1
law 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
nor 1
running 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
arrest 1
not 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
cause 1
oh 1
the 1
cause 1
is 1
excellent 1
then 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
rely 1
on 1
you 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
wish 1
when 1
mrs 1
turner 1
has 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
tray 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
he 1
said 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
hungrily 1
on 1
the 1
simple 1
fare 1
that 1
our 1
landlady 1
had 1
provided 1
i 1
must 1
discuss 1
it 1
while 1
i 1
eat 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
much 1
time 1
it 1
is 1
nearly 1
five 1
now 1
in 1
two 1
hours 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
miss 1
irene 1
or 1
madame 1
rather 1
returns 1
from 1
her 1
drive 1
at 1
seven 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
at 1
briony 1
lodge 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
and 1
what 1
then 1
you 1
must 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
arranged 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
occur 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
point 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
must 1
insist 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
interfere 1
come 1
what 1
may 1
you 1
understand 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
be 1
neutral 1
to 1
do 1
nothing 1
whatever 1
there 1
will 1
probably 1
be 1
some 1
small 1
unpleasantness 1
do 1
not 1
join 1
in 1
it 1
it 1
will 1
end 1
in 1
my 1
being 1
conveyed 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
minutes 1
afterwards 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
window 1
will 1
open 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
station 1
yourself 1
close 1
to 1
that 1
open 1
window 1
yes 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
watch 1
me 1
for 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
visible 1
to 1
you 1
yes 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
raise 1
my 1
handsoyou 1
will 1
throw 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
what 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
throw 1
and 1
will 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
raise 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
you 1
quite 1
follow 1
me 1
entirely 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
very 1
formidable 1

it 1
selflighting 1
your 1
task 1
is 1
confined 1
to 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
raise 1
your 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
up 1
by 1
quite 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
people 1
you 1
may 1
then 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
rejoin 1
you 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
myself 1
clear 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
remain 1
neutral 1
to 1
get 1
near 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
watch 1
you 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
signal 1
to 1
throw 1
in 1
this 1
object 1
then 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
to 1
wait 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
precisely 1
then 1
you 1
may 1
entirely 1
rely 1
on 1
me 1
that 1
is 1
excellent 1
i 1
think 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
prepare 1
for 1
the 1
new 1
role 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
play 1
he 1
disappeared 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
and 1
returned 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
an 1
amiable 1
and 1
simpleminded 1
nonconformist 1
clergyman 1
his 1
broad 1
black 1
hat 1
his 1
baggy 1
trousers 1
his 1
white 1
tie 1
his 1
sympathetic 1
smile 1
and 1
general 1
look 1
of 1
peering 1
and 1
benevolent 1
curiosity 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
mr 1
john 1
hare 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
equalled 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
merely 1
that 1
holmes 1
changed 1
his 1
costume 1
his 1
expression 1
his 1
manner 1
his 1
very 1
soul 1
seemed 1
to 1
vary 1
with 1
every 1
fresh 1
part 1
that 1
he 1
assumed 1
the 1
stage 1
lost 1
a 1
fine 1
actor 1
even 1
as 1
science 1
lost 1
an 1
acute 1
reasoner 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
specialist 1
in 1
crime 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
quarter 1
past 1
six 1
when 1
we 1
left 1
baker 1
street 1
and 1
it 1
still 1
wanted 1
ten 1
minutes 1
to 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
serpentine 1
avenue 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
dusk 1
and 1
the 1
lamps 1
were 1
just 1
being 1
lighted 1
as 1
we 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
briony 1
lodge 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
its 1
occupant 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
just 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
pictured 1
it 1
from 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
succinct 1
description 1
but 1
the 1
locality 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
less 1
private 1
than 1
i 1
expected 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
for 1
a 1
small 1
street 1
in 1
a 1
quiet 1
neighbourhood 1
it 1
was 1
remarkably 1
animated 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
shabbily 1
dressed 1
men 1
smoking 1
and 1
laughing 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
a 1
scissorsgrinder 1
with 1
his 1
wheel 1
two 1
guardsmen 1
who 1
were 1
flirting 1
with 1
a 1
nursegirl 1
and 1
several 1
welldressed 1
young 1
men 1
who 1
were 1
lounging 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
with 1
cigars 1
in 1
their 1
mouths 1
you 1
see 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
paced 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
this 1
marriage 1
rather 1
simplifies 1
matters 1
the 1
photograph 1
becomes 1
a 1
doubleedged 1
weapon 1
now 1
the 1
chances 1
are 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
averse 1
to 1
its 1
being 1
seen 1
by 1
mr 1
godfrey 1
norton 1
as 1
our 1
client 1
is 1
to 1
its 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
princess 1
now 1
the 1
question 1
is 1
where 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
photograph 1
where 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
unlikely 1
that 1
she 1
carries 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
her 1
it 1
is 1
cabinet 1
size 1
too 1
large 1
for 1
easy 1
concealment 1
about 1
a 1
womans 1
dress 1
she 1
knows 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
is 1
capable 1
of 1
having 1
her 1
waylaid 1
and 1
searched 1
two 1
attempts 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
have 1
already 1
been 1
made 1
we 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
then 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
carry 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
her 1
where 1
then 1
her 1
banker 1
or 1
her 1
lawyer 1
there 1
is 1
that 1
double 1
possibility 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
neither 1
women 1
are 1
naturally 1
secretive 1
and 1
they 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
their 1
own 1
secreting 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
hand 1
it 1
over 1
to 1
anyone 1
else 1
she 1
could 1
trust 1
her 1
own 1
guardianship 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
what 1
indirect 1
or 1
political 1
influence 1
might 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
bear 1
upon 1
a 1
business 1
man 1
besides 1
remember 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
resolved 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
where 1
she 1
can 1
lay 1
her 1
hands 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
twice 1
been 1
burgled 1
pshaw 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
look 1
but 1
how 1
will 1
you 1
look 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
look 1
what 1
then 1
i 1
will 1
get 1
her 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
will 1
refuse 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
but 1
i 1
hear 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
wheels 1
it 1
is 1
her 1
carriage 1
now 1
carry 1
out 1
my 1
orders 1
to 1
the 1
letter 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
sidelights 1
of 1
a 1
carriage 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
curve 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
smart 1
little 1
landau 1
which 1
rattled 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
briony 1
lodge 1
as 1
it 1
pulled 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loafing 1
men 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
dashed 1
forward 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
earning 1
a 1
copper 1
but 1
was 1
elbowed 1
away 1
by 1
another 1
loafer 1
who 1
had 1
rushed 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
intention 1
a 1
fierce 1
quarrel 1
broke 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
increased 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
guardsmen 1
who 1
took 1
sides 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loungers 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
scissorsgrinder 1
who 1
was 1
equally 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
a 1
blow 1
was 1
struck 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
stepped 1
from 1
her 1
carriage 1
was 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
flushed 1
and 1
struggling 1
men 1
who 1
struck 1
savagely 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
their 1
fists 1
and 1
sticks 1
holmes 1
dashed 1
into 1
the 1
crowd 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
lady 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
reached 1
her 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
and 1
dropped 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
running 1
freely 1
down 1
his 1
face 1
at 1
his 1
fall 1
the 1
guardsmen 1
took 1
to 1
their 1
heels 1
in 1
one 1
direction 1
and 1
the 1
loungers 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
while 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
betterdressed 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
the 1
scuffle 1
without 1
taking 1
part 1
in 1
it 1
crowded 1
in 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
lady 1
and 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
the 1
injured 1
man 1
irene 1
adler 1
as 1
i 1
will 1
still 1
call 1
her 1
had 1
hurried 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
but 1
she 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
with 1
her 1
superb 1
figure 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
looking 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
is 1
the 1
poor 1
gentleman 1
much 1
hurt 1
she 1
asked 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
cried 1
several 1
voices 1
no 1
no 1
theres 1
life 1
in 1
him 1
shouted 1
another 1
but 1
hell 1
be 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
hospital 1
hes 1
a 1
brave 1
fellow 1
said 1
a 1
woman 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
ladys 1
purse 1
and 1
watch 1
if 1
it 1
hadnt 1
been 1
for 1
him 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
gang 1
and 1
a 1
rough 1
one 1
too 1
ah 1
hes 1
breathing 1
now 1
he 1
cant 1
lie 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
may 1
we 1
bring 1
him 1
in 1
marm 1
surely 1
bring 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
comfortable 1
sofa 1
this 1
way 1
please 1
slowly 1
and 1
solemnly 1
he 1
was 1
borne 1
into 1
briony 1
lodge 1
and 1
laid 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
principal 1
room 1
while 1
i 1
still 1
observed 1
the 1
proceedings 1
from 1
my 1
post 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
lamps 1
had 1
been 1
lit 1
but 1
the 1
blinds 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
drawn 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
holmes 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
couch 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
compunction 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
for 1
the 1
part 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
felt 1
more 1
heartily 1
ashamed 1
of 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
beautiful 1
creature 1
against 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
conspiring 1
or 1
the 1
grace 1
and 1
kindliness 1
with 1
which 1
she 1
waited 1
upon 1
the 1
injured 1
man 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
blackest 1
treachery 1
to 1
holmes 1
to 1
draw 1
back 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
part 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
intrusted 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
hardened 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
smokerocket 1
from 1
under 1
my 1
ulster 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
thought 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
injuring 1
her 1
we 1
are 1
but 1
preventing 1
her 1
from 1
injuring 1
another 1
holmes 1
had 1
sat 1
up 1
upon 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
motion 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
air 1
a 1
maid 1
rushed 1
across 1
and 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
raise 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
signal 1
i 1
tossed 1
my 1
rocket 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
the 1
word 1
was 1
no 1
sooner 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
than 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
of 1
spectators 1
well 1
dressed 1
and 1
illgentlemen 1
ostlers 1
and 1
servantmaidsjoined 1
in 1
a 1
general 1
shriek 1
of 1
fire 1
thick 1
clouds 1
of 1
smoke 1
curled 1
through 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
i 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
rushing 1
figures 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
holmes 1
from 1
within 1
assuring 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
alarm 1
slipping 1
through 1
the 1
shouting 1
crowd 1
i 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
was 1
rejoiced 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
friends 1
arm 1
in 1
mine 1
and 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
uproar 1
he 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
and 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
until 1
we 1
had 1
turned 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
streets 1
which 1
lead 1
towards 1
the 1
edgeware 1
road 1
you 1
did 1
it 1
very 1
nicely 1
doctor 1
he 1
remarked 1
nothing 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
photograph 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
find 1
out 1
she 1
showed 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
she 1
would 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
mystery 1
said 1
he 1
laughing 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
perfectly 1
simple 1
you 1
of 1
course 1
saw 1
that 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
was 1
an 1
accomplice 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
engaged 1
for 1
the 1
evening 1
i 1
guessed 1
as 1
much 1
then 1
when 1
the 1
row 1
broke 1
out 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
moist 1
red 1
paint 1
in 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
i 1
rushed 1
forward 1
fell 1
down 1
clapped 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
piteous 1
spectacle 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
trick 1
that 1
also 1
i 1
could 1
fathom 1
then 1
they 1
carried 1
me 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
have 1
me 1
in 1
what 1
else 1
could 1
she 1
do 1
and 1
into 1
her 1
sittingroom 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
very 1
room 1
which 1
i 1
suspected 1
it 1
lay 1
between 1
that 1
and 1
her 1
bedroom 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
they 1
laid 1
me 1
on 1
a 1
couch 1
i 1
motioned 1
for 1
air 1
they 1
were 1
compelled 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
you 1
had 1
your 1
chance 1
how 1
did 1
that 1
help 1
you 1
it 1
was 1
allimportant 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
thinks 1
that 1
her 1
house 1
is 1
on 1
fire 1
her 1
instinct 1
is 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
rush 1
to 1
the 1
thing 1
which 1
she 1
values 1
most 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
overpowering 1
impulse 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
taken 1
advantage 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
darlington 1
substitution 1
scandal 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
also 1
in 1
the 1
arnsworth 1
castle 1
business 1
a 1
married 1
woman 1
grabs 1
at 1
her 1
baby 1
an 1
unmarried 1
one 1
reaches 1
for 1
her 1
jewelbox 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
our 1
lady 1
of 1
today 1
had 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
more 1
precious 1
to 1
her 1
than 1
what 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
quest 1
of 1
she 1
would 1
rush 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
the 1
alarm 1
of 1
fire 1
was 1
admirably 1
done 1
the 1
smoke 1
and 1
shouting 1
were 1
enough 1
to 1
shake 1
nerves 1
of 1
steel 1
she 1
responded 1
beautifully 1
the 1
photograph 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
recess 1
behind 1
a 1
sliding 1
panel 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
right 1
bellpull 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
and 1
i 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
she 1
halfdrew 1
it 1
out 1
when 1
i 1
cried 1
out 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
alarm 1
she 1
replaced 1
it 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
rocket 1
rushed 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
i 1
rose 1
and 1
making 1
my 1
excuses 1
escaped 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
hesitated 1
whether 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
secure 1
the 1
photograph 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
the 1
coachman 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
watching 1
me 1
narrowly 1
it 1
seemed 1
safer 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
little 1
overprecipitance 1
may 1
ruin 1
all 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
asked 1
our 1
quest 1
is 1
practically 1
finished 1
i 1
shall 1
call 1
with 1
the 1
king 1
tomorrow 1
and 1
with 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
sittingroom 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
lady 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
comes 1
she 1
may 1
find 1
neither 1
us 1
nor 1
the 1
photograph 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
his 1
majesty 1
to 1
regain 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
and 1
when 1
will 1
you 1
call 1
at 1
eight 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
up 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
field 1
besides 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
prompt 1
for 1
this 1
marriage 1
may 1
mean 1
a 1
complete 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
habits 1
i 1
must 1
wire 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
without 1
delay 1
we 1
had 1
reached 1
baker 1
street 1
and 1
had 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
was 1
searching 1
his 1
pockets 1
for 1
the 1
key 1
when 1
someone 1
passing 1
said 1
goodnight 1
mister 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
greeting 1
appeared 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
a 1
slim 1
youth 1
in 1
an 1
ulster 1
who 1
had 1
hurried 1
by 1
ive 1
heard 1
that 1
voice 1
before 1
said 1
holmes 1
staring 1
down 1
the 1
dimly 1
lit 1
street 1
now 1
i 1
wonder 1
who 1
the 1
deuce 1
that 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
iii 1
i 1
slept 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
upon 1
our 1
toast 1
and 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
you 1
have 1
really 1
got 1
it 1
he 1
cried 1
grasping 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
by 1
either 1
shoulder 1
and 1
looking 1
eagerly 1
into 1
his 1
face 1
not 1
yet 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
hopes 1
i 1
have 1
hopes 1
then 1
come 1
i 1
am 1
all 1
impatience 1
to 1
be 1
gone 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
cab 1
no 1
my 1
brougham 1
is 1
waiting 1
then 1
that 1
will 1
simplify 1
matters 1
we 1
descended 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
briony 1
lodge 1
irene 1
adler 1
is 1
married 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
married 1
when 1
yesterday 1
but 1
to 1
whom 1
to 1
an 1
english 1
lawyer 1
named 1
norton 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
love 1
him 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
hopes 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
and 1
why 1
in 1
hopes 1
because 1
it 1
would 1
spare 1
your 1
majesty 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
future 1
annoyance 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
loves 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
your 1
majesty 1
if 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
your 1
majesty 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
should 1
interfere 1
with 1
your 1
majestys 1
plan 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
and 1
yetwell 1
i 1
wish 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
station 1
what 1
a 1
queen 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
he 1
relapsed 1
into 1
a 1
moody 1
silence 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
broken 1
until 1
we 1
drew 1
up 1
in 1
serpentine 1
avenue 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
briony 1
lodge 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
an 1
elderly 1
woman 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
steps 1
she 1
watched 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
sardonic 1
eye 1
as 1
we 1
stepped 1
from 1
the 1
brougham 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
i 1
believe 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
mr 1
holmes 1
answered 1
my 1
companion 1
looking 1
at 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
questioning 1
and 1
rather 1
startled 1
gaze 1
indeed 1
my 1
mistress 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
likely 1
to 1
call 1
she 1
left 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
her 1
husband 1
by 1
the 1
515 1
train 1
from 1
charing 1
cross 1
for 1
the 1
continent 1
what 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
staggered 1
back 1
white 1
with 1
chagrin 1
and 1
surprise 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
left 1
england 1
never 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
the 1
papers 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
hoarsely 1
all 1
is 1
lost 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
he 1
pushed 1
past 1
the 1
servant 1
and 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
drawingroom 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
myself 1
the 1
furniture 1
was 1
scattered 1
about 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
with 1
dismantled 1
shelves 1
and 1
open 1
drawers 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
hurriedly 1
ransacked 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
flight 1
holmes 1
rushed 1
at 1
the 1
bellpull 1
tore 1
back 1
a 1
small 1
sliding 1
shutter 1
and 1
plunging 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
pulled 1
out 1
a 1
photograph 1
and 1
a 1
letter 1
the 1
photograph 1
was 1
of 1
irene 1
adler 1
herself 1
in 1
evening 1
dress 1
the 1
letter 1
was 1
superscribed 1
to 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
esq 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
till 1
called 1
for 1
my 1
friend 1
tore 1
it 1
open 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
read 1
it 1
together 1
it 1
was 1
dated 1
at 1
midnight 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
and 1
ran 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
my 1
dear 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmesyou 1
really 1
did 1
it 1
very 1
well 1
you 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
completely 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
alarm 1
of 1
fire 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
suspicion 1
but 1
then 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
how 1
i 1
had 1
betrayed 1
myself 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
warned 1
against 1
you 1
months 1
ago 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
king 1
employed 1
an 1
agent 1
it 1
would 1
certainly 1
be 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
address 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
me 1
yet 1
with 1
all 1
this 1
you 1
made 1
me 1
reveal 1
what 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
even 1
after 1
i 1
became 1
suspicious 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
think 1
evil 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
dear 1
kind 1
old 1
clergyman 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
trained 1
as 1
an 1
actress 1
myself 1
male 1
costume 1
is 1
nothing 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
often 1
take 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
freedom 1
which 1
it 1
gives 1
i 1
sent 1
john 1
the 1
coachman 1
to 1
watch 1
you 1
ran 1
up 1
stairs 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
walkingclothes 1
as 1
i 1
call 1
them 1
and 1
came 1
down 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
departed 1
well 1
i 1
followed 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
door 1
and 1
so 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
really 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
the 1
celebrated 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
then 1
i 1
rather 1
imprudently 1
wished 1
you 1
goodnight 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
temple 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
husband 1
we 1
both 1
thought 1
the 1
best 1
resource 1
was 1
flight 1
when 1
pursued 1
by 1
so 1
formidable 1
an 1
antagonist 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
the 1
nest 1
empty 1
when 1
you 1
call 1
tomorrow 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
photograph 1
your 1
client 1
may 1
rest 1
in 1
peace 1
i 1
love 1
and 1
am 1
loved 1
by 1
a 1
better 1
man 1
than 1
he 1
the 1
king 1
may 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
will 1
without 1
hindrance 1
from 1
one 1
whom 1
he 1
has 1
cruelly 1
wronged 1
i 1
keep 1
it 1
only 1
to 1
safeguard 1
myself 1
and 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
weapon 1
which 1
will 1
always 1
secure 1
me 1
from 1
any 1
steps 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
i 1
leave 1
a 1
photograph 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
care 1
to 1
possess 1
and 1
i 1
remain 1
dear 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
very 1
truly 1
yours 1
irene 1
norton 1
nee 1
adler 1
what 1
a 1
womanoh 1
what 1
a 1
woman 1
cried 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
three 1
read 1
this 1
epistle 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
quick 1
and 1
resolute 1
she 1
was 1
would 1
she 1
not 1
have 1
made 1
an 1
admirable 1
queen 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
on 1
my 1
level 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
she 1
seems 1
indeed 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
level 1
to 1
your 1
majesty 1
said 1
holmes 1
coldly 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
bring 1
your 1
majestys 1
business 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
successful 1
conclusion 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
cried 1
the 1
king 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
successful 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
her 1
word 1
is 1
inviolate 1
the 1
photograph 1
is 1
now 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
fire 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
your 1
majesty 1
say 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
immensely 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
in 1
what 1
way 1
i 1
can 1
reward 1
you 1
this 1
ring 1
he 1
slipped 1
an 1
emerald 1
snake 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
your 1
majesty 1
has 1
something 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
value 1
even 1
more 1
highly 1
said 1
holmes 1
you 1
have 1
but 1
to 1
name 1
it 1
this 1
photograph 1
the 1
king 1
stared 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
amazement 1
irenes 1
photograph 1
he 1
cried 1
certainly 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
it 1
i 1
thank 1
your 1
majesty 1
then 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
wish 1
you 1
a 1
very 1
goodmorning 1
he 1
bowed 1
and 1
turning 1
away 1
without 1
observing 1
the 1
hand 1
which 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
stretched 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
set 1
off 1
in 1
my 1
company 1
for 1
his 1
chambers 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
how 1
a 1
great 1
scandal 1
threatened 1
to 1
affect 1
the 1
kingdom 1
of 1
bohemia 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
best 1
plans 1
of 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
were 1
beaten 1
by 1
a 1
womans 1
wit 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
make 1
merry 1
over 1
the 1
cleverness 1
of 1
women 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
heard 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
of 1
late 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
of 1
irene 1
adler 1
or 1
when 1
he 1
refers 1
to 1
her 1
photograph 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
under 1
the 1
honourable 1
title 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
adventure 1
ii 1
the 1
redheaded 1
league 1
i 1
had 1
called 1
upon 1
my 1
friend 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
autumn 1
of 1
last 1
year 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
in 1
deep 1
conversation 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
stout 1
floridfaced 1
elderly 1
gentleman 1
with 1
fiery 1
red 1
hair 1
with 1
an 1
apology 1
for 1
my 1
intrusion 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
withdraw 1
when 1
holmes 1
pulled 1
me 1
abruptly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
me 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
have 1
come 1
at 1
a 1
better 1
time 1
my 1
dear 1
watson 1
he 1
said 1
cordially 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
engaged 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
can 1
wait 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
gentleman 1
mr 1
wilson 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
partner 1
and 1
helper 1
in 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
most 1
successful 1
cases 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
yours 1
also 1
the 1
stout 1
gentleman 1
half 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
bob 1
of 1
greeting 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
little 1
questioning 1
glance 1
from 1
his 1
small 1
fatencircled 1
eyes 1
try 1
the 1
settee 1
said 1
holmes 1
relapsing 1
into 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
fingertips 1
together 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
when 1
in 1
judicial 1
moods 1
i 1
know 1
my 1
dear 1
watson 1
that 1
you 1
share 1
my 1
love 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
bizarre 1
and 1
outside 1
the 1
conventions 1
and 1
humdrum 1
routine 1
of 1
everyday 1
life 1
you 1
have 1
shown 1
your 1
relish 1
for 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
has 1
prompted 1
you 1
to 1
chronicle 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
somewhat 1
to 1
embellish 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
adventures 1
your 1
cases 1
have 1
indeed 1
been 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
interest 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
observed 1
you 1
will 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
remarked 1
the 1
other 1
day 1
just 1
before 1
we 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
very 1
simple 1
problem 1
presented 1
by 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
that 1
for 1
strange 1
effects 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
combinations 1
we 1
must 1
go 1
to 1
life 1
itself 1
which 1
is 1
always 1
far 1
more 1
daring 1
than 1
any 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
a 1
proposition 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
doubting 1
you 1
did 1
doctor 1
but 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
round 1
to 1
my 1
view 1
for 1
otherwise 1
i 1
shall 1
keep 1
on 1
piling 1
fact 1
upon 1
fact 1
on 1
you 1
until 1
your 1
reason 1
breaks 1
down 1
under 1
them 1
and 1
acknowledges 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
right 1
now 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
here 1
has 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
to 1
begin 1
a 1
narrative 1
which 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
singular 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
listened 1
to 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
me 1
remark 1
that 1
the 1
strangest 1
and 1
most 1
unique 1
things 1
are 1
very 1
often 1
connected 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
larger 1
but 1
with 1
the 1
smaller 1
crimes 1
and 1
occasionally 1
indeed 1
where 1
there 1
is 1
room 1
for 1
doubt 1
whether 1
any 1
positive 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
whether 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
is 1
an 1
instance 1
of 1
crime 1
or 1
not 1
but 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
is 1
certainly 1
among 1
the 1
most 1
singular 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
perhaps 1
mr 1
wilson 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
kindness 1
to 1
recommence 1
your 1
narrative 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
merely 1
because 1
my 1
friend 1
dr 1
watson 1
has 1
not 1
heard 1
the 1
opening 1
part 1
but 1
also 1
because 1
the 1
peculiar 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
makes 1
me 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
every 1
possible 1
detail 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
some 1
slight 1
indication 1
of 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
i 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
guide 1
myself 1
by 1
the 1
thousands 1
of 1
other 1
similar 1
cases 1
which 1
occur 1
to 1
my 1
memory 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
instance 1
i 1
am 1
forced 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
my 1
belief 1
unique 1
the 1
portly 1
client 1
puffed 1
out 1
his 1
chest 1
with 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
some 1
little 1
pride 1
and 1
pulled 1
a 1
dirty 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
inside 1
pocket 1
of 1
his 1
greatcoat 1
as 1
he 1
glanced 1
down 1
the 1
advertisement 1
column 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
thrust 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
flattened 1
out 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
i 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
after 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
my 1
companion 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
indications 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
presented 1
by 1
his 1
dress 1
or 1
appearance 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
gain 1
very 1
much 1
however 1
by 1
my 1
inspection 1
our 1
visitor 1
bore 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
being 1
an 1
average 1
commonplace 1
british 1
tradesman 1
obese 1
pompous 1
and 1
slow 1
he 1
wore 1
rather 1
baggy 1
grey 1
shepherds 1
check 1
trousers 1
a 1
not 1
overclean 1
black 1
frockcoat 1
unbuttoned 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
a 1
drab 1
waistcoat 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
brassy 1
albert 1
chain 1
and 1
a 1
square 1
pierced 1
bit 1
of 1
metal 1
dangling 1
down 1
as 1
an 1
ornament 1
a 1
frayed 1
tophat 1
and 1
a 1
faded 1
brown 1
overcoat 1
with 1
a 1
wrinkled 1
velvet 1
collar 1
lay 1
upon 1
a 1
chair 1
beside 1
him 1
altogether 1
look 1
as 1
i 1
would 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
about 1
the 1
man 1
save 1
his 1
blazing 1
red 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
extreme 1
chagrin 1
and 1
discontent 1
upon 1
his 1
features 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
quick 1
eye 1
took 1
in 1
my 1
occupation 1
and 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
as 1
he 1
noticed 1
my 1
questioning 1
glances 1
beyond 1
the 1
obvious 1
facts 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
at 1
some 1
time 1
done 1
manual 1
labour 1
that 1
he 1
takes 1
snuff 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
freemason 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
china 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
a 1
considerable 1
amount 1
of 1
writing 1
lately 1
i 1
can 1
deduce 1
nothing 1
else 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
started 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
forefinger 1
upon 1
the 1
paper 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
goodfortune 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
mr 1
holmes 1
he 1
asked 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
for 1
example 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
manual 1
labour 1
its 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
gospel 1
for 1
i 1
began 1
as 1
a 1
ships 1
carpenter 1
your 1
hands 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
your 1
right 1
hand 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
size 1
larger 1
than 1
your 1
left 1
you 1
have 1
worked 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
muscles 1
are 1
more 1
developed 1
well 1
the 1
snuff 1
then 1
and 1
the 1
freemasonry 1
i 1
wont 1
insult 1
your 1
intelligence 1
by 1
telling 1
you 1
how 1
i 1
read 1
that 1
especially 1
as 1
rather 1
against 1
the 1
strict 1
rules 1
of 1
your 1
order 1
you 1
use 1
an 1
arcandcompass 1
breastpin 1
ah 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
forgot 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
writing 1
what 1
else 1
can 1
be 1
indicated 1
by 1
that 1
right 1
cuff 1
so 1
very 1
shiny 1
for 1
five 1
inches 1
and 1
the 1
left 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
smooth 1
patch 1
near 1
the 1
elbow 1
where 1
you 1
rest 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
desk 1
well 1
but 1
china 1
the 1
fish 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
tattooed 1
immediately 1
above 1
your 1
right 1
wrist 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
been 1
done 1
in 1
china 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
small 1
study 1
of 1
tattoo 1
marks 1
and 1
have 1
even 1
contributed 1
to 1
the 1
literature 1
of 1
the 1
subject 1
that 1
trick 1
of 1
staining 1
the 1
fishes 1
scales 1
of 1
a 1
delicate 1
pink 1
is 1
quite 1
peculiar 1
to 1
china 1
when 1
in 1
addition 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
chinese 1
coin 1
hanging 1
from 1
your 1
watchchain 1
the 1
matter 1
becomes 1
even 1
more 1
simple 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
laughed 1
heavily 1
well 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
thought 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
done 1
something 1
clever 1
but 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
that 1
i 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
explaining 1
omne 1
ignotum 1
pro 1
magnifico 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
my 1
poor 1
little 1
reputation 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
will 1
suffer 1
shipwreck 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
candid 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
find 1
the 1
advertisement 1
mr 1
wilson 1
yes 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
it 1
now 1
he 1
answered 1
with 1
his 1
thick 1
red 1
finger 1
planted 1
halfway 1
down 1
the 1
column 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
this 1

what 1
began 1

i 1
ejaculated 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
twice 1
read 1
over 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
announcement 1
holmes 1
chuckled 1
and 1
wriggled 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
habit 1
when 1
in 1
high 1
spirits 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
off 1
the 1
beaten 1

which 1
this 1
advertisement 1
had 1
upon 1
your 1
fortunes 1
you 1
will 1
first 1
make 1
a 1
note 1
doctor 1
of 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
the 1
date 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
morning 1
chronicle 1
of 1
april 1
27 1
1890 1
just 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
very 1
good 1
now 1
mr 1
wilson 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
telling 1
you 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
said 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
mopping 1
his 1
forehead 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
small 1
pawnbrokers 1
business 1
at 1
coburg 1
square 1
near 1
the 1
city 1
its 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
affair 1
and 1
of 1
late 1
years 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
done 1
more 1
than 1
just 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
living 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
keep 1
two 1
assistants 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
only 1
keep 1
one 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
job 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
willing 1
to 1
come 1
for 1
half 1
wages 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
business 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
obliging 1
youth 1
asked 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
vincent 1
spaulding 1
and 1
hes 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
youth 1
either 1
its 1
hard 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
age 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
wish 1
a 1
smarter 1
assistant 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
very 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
better 1
himself 1
and 1
earn 1
twice 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
satisfied 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
put 1
ideas 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
why 1
indeed 1
you 1
seem 1
most 1
fortunate 1
in 1
having 1
an 1
employe 1
who 1
comes 1
under 1
the 1
full 1
market 1
price 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
common 1
experience 1
among 1
employers 1
in 1
this 1
age 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
that 1
your 1
assistant 1
is 1
not 1
as 1
remarkable 1
as 1
your 1
advertisement 1
oh 1
he 1
has 1
his 1
faults 1
too 1
said 1
mr 1
wilson 1
never 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
fellow 1
for 1
photography 1
snapping 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
camera 1
when 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
improving 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
then 1
diving 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
like 1
a 1
rabbit 1
into 1
its 1
hole 1
to 1
develop 1
his 1
pictures 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
main 1
fault 1

that 1
advertisement 1
spaulding 1
he 1
came 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
office 1
just 1
this 1
day 1
eight 1
weeks 1
with 1
this 1
very 1
paper 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
the 1
lord 1
mr 1
wilson 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
redheaded 1
man 1

that 1
i 1
asks 1

says 1
he 1
heres 1
another 1
vacancy 1
on 1
the 1
league 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
men 1
its 1
worth 1
quite 1
a 1
little 1
fortune 1
to 1
any 1
man 1
who 1
gets 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
more 1
vacancies 1
than 1
there 1
are 1
men 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
trustees 1
are 1
at 1
their 1
wits 1
end 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
if 1
my 1
hair 1
would 1
only 1
change 1
colour 1
heres 1
a 1
nice 1
little 1
crib 1
all 1
ready 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
step 1
into 1
why 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
see 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
very 1
stayathome 1
man 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
business 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
instead 1
of 1
my 1
having 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
often 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
without 1
putting 1
my 1
foot 1
over 1
the 1
doormat 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
i 1
didnt 1
know 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
outside 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
always 1
glad 1
of 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
news 1
have 1
you 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
league 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
men 1
he 1
asked 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
never 1
why 1
i 1
wonder 1
at 1
that 1
for 1
you 1
are 1
eligible 1
yourself 1
for 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
vacancies 1
and 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
worth 1
i 1
asked 1
oh 1
merely 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
but 1
the 1
work 1
is 1
slight 1
and 1
it 1
need 1
not 1
interfere 1
very 1
much 1
with 1
ones 1
other 1
occupations 1
well 1
you 1
can 1
easily 1
think 1
that 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
prick 1
up 1
my 1
ears 1
for 1
the 1
business 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
overgood 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
and 1
an 1
extra 1
couple 1
of 1
hundred 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
handy 1
tell 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
said 1
i 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
showing 1
me 1
the 1
advertisement 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
for 1
yourself 1
that 1
the 1
league 1
has 1
a 1
vacancy 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
address 1
where 1
you 1
should 1
apply 1
for 1
particulars 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
league 1
was 1
founded 1
by 1
an 1
american 1
millionaire 1
ezekiah 1
hopkins 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
peculiar 1
in 1
his 1
ways 1
he 1
was 1
himself 1
redheaded 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
sympathy 1
for 1
all 1
redheaded 1
men 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
died 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
enormous 1
fortune 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
trustees 1
with 1
instructions 1
to 1
apply 1
the 1
interest 1
to 1
the 1
providing 1
of 1
easy 1
berths 1
to 1
men 1
whose 1
hair 1
is 1
of 1
that 1
colour 1
from 1
all 1
i 1
hear 1
it 1
is 1
splendid 1
pay 1
and 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
said 1
i 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
millions 1
of 1
redheaded 1
men 1
who 1
would 1
apply 1
not 1
so 1
many 1
as 1
you 1
might 1
think 1
he 1
answered 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
confined 1
to 1
londoners 1
and 1
to 1
grown 1
men 1
this 1
american 1
had 1
started 1
from 1
london 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
old 1
town 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
then 1
again 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
your 1
applying 1
if 1
your 1
hair 1
is 1
light 1
red 1
or 1
dark 1
red 1
or 1
anything 1
but 1
real 1
bright 1
blazing 1
fiery 1
red 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
cared 1
to 1
apply 1
mr 1
wilson 1
you 1
would 1
just 1
walk 1
in 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
hardly 1
be 1
worth 1
your 1
while 1
to 1
put 1
yourself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
fact 1
gentlemen 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
see 1
for 1
yourselves 1
that 1
my 1
hair 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
full 1
and 1
rich 1
tint 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
competition 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
stood 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
chance 1
as 1
any 1
man 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
met 1
vincent 1
spaulding 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
that 1
i 1
thought 1
he 1
might 1
prove 1
useful 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
the 1
shutters 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
to 1
come 1
right 1
away 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
willing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
holiday 1
so 1
we 1
shut 1
the 1
business 1
up 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
for 1
the 1
address 1
that 1
was 1
given 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
advertisement 1
i 1
never 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
sight 1
as 1
that 1
again 1
mr 1
holmes 1
from 1
north 1
south 1
east 1
and 1
west 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
his 1
hair 1
had 1
tramped 1
into 1
the 1
city 1
to 1
answer 1
the 1
advertisement 1
fleet 1
street 1
was 1
choked 1
with 1
redheaded 1
folk 1
and 1
popes 1
court 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
costers 1
orange 1
barrow 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
thought 1
there 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
as 1
were 1
brought 1
together 1
by 1
that 1
single 1
advertisement 1
every 1
shade 1
of 1
colour 1
they 1
werestraw 1
lemon 1
orange 1
brick 1
irishsetter 1
liver 1
clay 1
but 1
as 1
spaulding 1
said 1
there 1
were 1
not 1
many 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
real 1
vivid 1
flamecoloured 1
tint 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
how 1
many 1
were 1
waiting 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
but 1
spaulding 1
would 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
how 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
but 1
he 1
pushed 1
and 1
pulled 1
and 1
butted 1
until 1
he 1
got 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
stream 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
some 1
going 1
up 1
in 1
hope 1
and 1
some 1
coming 1
back 1
dejected 1
but 1
we 1
wedged 1
in 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
and 1
soon 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
your 1
experience 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
most 1
entertaining 1
one 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
as 1
his 1
client 1
paused 1
and 1
refreshed 1
his 1
memory 1
with 1
a 1
huge 1
pinch 1
of 1
snuff 1
pray 1
continue 1
your 1
very 1
interesting 1
statement 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
but 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
wooden 1
chairs 1
and 1
a 1
deal 1
table 1
behind 1
which 1
sat 1
a 1
small 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
head 1
that 1
was 1
even 1
redder 1
than 1
mine 1
he 1
said 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
to 1
each 1
candidate 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
always 1
managed 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
fault 1
in 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
disqualify 1
them 1
getting 1
a 1
vacancy 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
easy 1
matter 1
after 1
all 1
however 1
when 1
our 1
turn 1
came 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
favourable 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
a 1
private 1
word 1
with 1
us 1
this 1
is 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
said 1
my 1
assistant 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
willing 1
to 1
fill 1
a 1
vacancy 1
in 1
the 1
league 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
admirably 1
suited 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
he 1
has 1
every 1
requirement 1
i 1
cannot 1
recall 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
anything 1
so 1
fine 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
backward 1
cocked 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
my 1
hair 1
until 1
i 1
felt 1
quite 1
bashful 1
then 1
suddenly 1
he 1
plunged 1
forward 1
wrung 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
congratulated 1
me 1
warmly 1
on 1
my 1
success 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
injustice 1
to 1
hesitate 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
will 1
however 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
taking 1
an 1
obvious 1
precaution 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
seized 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
both 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
tugged 1
until 1
i 1
yelled 1
with 1
the 1
pain 1
there 1
is 1
water 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
released 1
me 1
i 1
perceive 1
that 1
all 1
is 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
careful 1
for 1
we 1
have 1
twice 1
been 1
deceived 1
by 1
wigs 1
and 1
once 1
by 1
paint 1
i 1
could 1
tell 1
you 1
tales 1
of 1
cobblers 1
wax 1
which 1
would 1
disgust 1
you 1
with 1
human 1
nature 1
he 1
stepped 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
shouted 1
through 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
that 1
the 1
vacancy 1
was 1
filled 1
a 1
groan 1
of 1
disappointment 1
came 1
up 1
from 1
below 1
and 1
the 1
folk 1
all 1
trooped 1
away 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
redhead 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
except 1
my 1
own 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
manager 1
my 1
name 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
mr 1
duncan 1
ross 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
myself 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
pensioners 1
upon 1
the 1
fund 1
left 1
by 1
our 1
noble 1
benefactor 1
are 1
you 1
a 1
married 1
man 1
mr 1
wilson 1
have 1
you 1
a 1
family 1
i 1
answered 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
his 1
face 1
fell 1
immediately 1
dear 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
serious 1
indeed 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
fund 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
for 1
the 1
propagation 1
and 1
spread 1
of 1
the 1
redheads 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
for 1
their 1
maintenance 1
it 1
is 1
exceedingly 1
unfortunate 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
bachelor 1
my 1
face 1
lengthened 1
at 1
this 1
mr 1
holmes 1
for 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
vacancy 1
after 1
all 1
but 1
after 1
thinking 1
it 1
over 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
another 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
objection 1
might 1
be 1
fatal 1
but 1
we 1
must 1
stretch 1
a 1
point 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
head 1
of 1
hair 1
as 1
yours 1
when 1
shall 1
you 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
enter 1
upon 1
your 1
new 1
duties 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
awkward 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
business 1
already 1
said 1
i 1
oh 1
never 1
mind 1
about 1
that 1
mr 1
wilson 1
said 1
vincent 1
spaulding 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
that 1
for 1
you 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
hours 1
i 1
asked 1
ten 1
to 1
two 1
now 1
a 1
pawnbrokers 1
business 1
is 1
mostly 1
done 1
of 1
an 1
evening 1
mr 1
holmes 1
especially 1
thursday 1
and 1
friday 1
evening 1
which 1
is 1
just 1
before 1
payday 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
suit 1
me 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
the 1
mornings 1
besides 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
assistant 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
to 1
anything 1
that 1
turned 1
up 1
that 1
would 1
suit 1
me 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
the 1
pay 1
is 1
4 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
the 1
work 1
is 1
purely 1
nominal 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
purely 1
nominal 1
well 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
in 1
the 1
building 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
if 1
you 1
leave 1
you 1
forfeit 1
your 1
whole 1
position 1
forever 1
the 1
will 1
is 1
very 1
clear 1
upon 1
that 1
point 1
you 1

goodbye 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
congratulate 1
you 1
once 1
more 1
on 1
the 1
important 1
position 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
gain 1
he 1
bowed 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
my 1
assistant 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
do 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
good 1
fortune 1
well 1
i 1
thought 1
over 1
the 1
matter 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
by 1
evening 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
low 1
spirits 1
again 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
quite 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
affair 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
great 1
hoax 1
or 1
fraud 1
though 1
what 1
its 1
object 1
might 1
be 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
it 1
seemed 1
altogether 1
past 1
belief 1
that 1
anyone 1
could 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
will 1
or 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
pay 1
such 1
a 1
sum 1
for 1
doing 1
anything 1
so 1
simple 1
as 1
copying 1
out 1
the 1
encyclopaedia 1
britannica 1
vincent 1
spaulding 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
cheer 1
me 1
up 1
but 1
by 1
bedtime 1
i 1
had 1
reasoned 1
myself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
however 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
anyhow 1
so 1
i 1
bought 1
a 1
penny 1
bottle 1
of 1
ink 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
quillpen 1
and 1
seven 1
sheets 1
of 1
foolscap 1
paper 1
i 1
started 1
off 1
for 1
popes 1
court 1
well 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
and 1
delight 1
everything 1
was 1
as 1
right 1
as 1
possible 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
set 1
out 1
ready 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
mr 1
duncan 1
ross 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
got 1
fairly 1
to 1
work 1
he 1
started 1
me 1
off 1
upon 1
the 1
letter 1
a 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
left 1
me 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
drop 1
in 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
right 1
with 1
me 1
at 1
two 1
oclock 1
he 1
bade 1
me 1
goodday 1
complimented 1
me 1
upon 1
the 1
amount 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
written 1
and 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
after 1
me 1
this 1
went 1
on 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
on 1
saturday 1
the 1
manager 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
planked 1
down 1
four 1
golden 1
sovereigns 1
for 1
my 1
weeks 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
next 1
week 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
the 1
week 1
after 1
every 1
morning 1
i 1
was 1
there 1
at 1
ten 1
and 1
every 1
afternoon 1
i 1
left 1
at 1
two 1
by 1
degrees 1
mr 1
duncan 1
ross 1
took 1
to 1
coming 1
in 1
only 1
once 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
and 1
then 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
all 1
still 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
never 1
dared 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
when 1
he 1
might 1
come 1
and 1
the 1
billet 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
and 1
suited 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
risk 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
it 1
eight 1
weeks 1
passed 1
away 1
like 1
this 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
written 1
about 1
abbots 1
and 1
archery 1
and 1
armour 1
and 1
architecture 1
and 1
attica 1
and 1
hoped 1
with 1
diligence 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
get 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
bs 1
before 1
very 1
long 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
something 1
in 1
foolscap 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
pretty 1
nearly 1
filled 1
a 1
shelf 1
with 1
my 1
writings 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
yes 1
sir 1
and 1
no 1
later 1
than 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
my 1
work 1
as 1
usual 1
at 1
ten 1
oclock 1
but 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
shut 1
and 1
locked 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
square 1
of 1
cardboard 1
hammered 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
panel 1
with 1
a 1
tack 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
read 1
for 1
yourself 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
white 1
cardboard 1
about 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
notepaper 1
it 1
read 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
the 1
redheaded 1
league 1
is 1
dissolved 1
october 1
9 1
1890 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
surveyed 1
this 1
curt 1
announcement 1
and 1
the 1
rueful 1
face 1
behind 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
comical 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
so 1
completely 1
overtopped 1
every 1
other 1
consideration 1
that 1
we 1
both 1
burst 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
roar 1
of 1
laughter 1
i 1
cannot 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
very 1
funny 1
cried 1
our 1
client 1
flushing 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
his 1
flaming 1
head 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
better 1
than 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
i 1
can 1
go 1
elsewhere 1
no 1
no 1
cried 1
holmes 1
shoving 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
chair 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
half 1
risen 1
i 1
really 1
wouldnt 1
miss 1
your 1
case 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
refreshingly 1
unusual 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
something 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
funny 1
about 1
it 1
pray 1
what 1
steps 1
did 1
you 1
take 1
when 1
you 1
found 1
the 1
card 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
was 1
staggered 1
sir 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
then 1
i 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
offices 1
round 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
finally 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
landlord 1
who 1
is 1
an 1
accountant 1
living 1
on 1
the 1
groundfloor 1
and 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
league 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
any 1
such 1
body 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
who 1
mr 1
duncan 1
ross 1
was 1
he 1
answered 1
that 1
the 1
name 1
was 1
new 1
to 1
him 1
well 1
said 1
i 1
the 1
gentleman 1
at 1
no 1
4 1
what 1
the 1
redheaded 1
man 1
yes 1
oh 1
said 1
he 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
william 1
morris 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
solicitor 1
and 1
was 1
using 1
my 1
room 1
as 1
a 1
temporary 1
convenience 1
until 1
his 1
new 1
premises 1
were 1
ready 1
he 1
moved 1
out 1
yesterday 1
where 1
could 1
i 1
find 1
him 1
oh 1
at 1
his 1
new 1
offices 1
he 1
did 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
address 1
yes 1
17 1
king 1
edward 1
street 1
near 1
st 1
pauls 1
i 1
started 1
off 1
mr 1
holmes 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
address 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
manufactory 1
of 1
artificial 1
kneecaps 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
it 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
either 1
mr 1
william 1
morris 1
or 1
mr 1
duncan 1
ross 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
asked 1
holmes 1
i 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
advice 1
of 1
my 1
assistant 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
waited 1
i 1
should 1
hear 1
by 1
post 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
quite 1
good 1
enough 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
lose 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
without 1
a 1
struggle 1
so 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
give 1
advice 1
to 1
poor 1
folk 1
who 1
were 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
did 1
very 1
wisely 1
said 1
holmes 1
your 1
case 1
is 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
remarkable 1
one 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
it 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
graver 1
issues 1
hang 1
from 1
it 1
than 1
might 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
appear 1
grave 1
enough 1
said 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
why 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
four 1
pound 1
a 1
week 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
personally 1
concerned 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
grievance 1
against 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
league 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
you 1
are 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
richer 1
by 1
some 1
30 1
pounds 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
minute 1
knowledge 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
gained 1
on 1
every 1
subject 1
which 1
comes 1
under 1
the 1
letter 1
a 1
you 1
have 1
lost 1
nothing 1
by 1
them 1
no 1
sir 1
but 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
about 1
them 1
and 1
who 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
their 1
object 1
was 1
in 1
playing 1
this 1
prankif 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
prankupon 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pretty 1
expensive 1
joke 1
for 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
cost 1
them 1
two 1
and 1
thirty 1
pounds 1
we 1
shall 1
endeavour 1
to 1
clear 1
up 1
these 1
points 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
first 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
questions 1
mr 1
wilson 1
this 1
assistant 1
of 1
yours 1
who 1
first 1
called 1
your 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
advertisementhow 1
long 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
with 1
you 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
then 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
come 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
an 1
advertisement 1
was 1
he 1
the 1
only 1
applicant 1
no 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
dozen 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
pick 1
him 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
handy 1
and 1
would 1
come 1
cheap 1
at 1
halfwages 1
in 1
fact 1
yes 1
what 1
is 1
he 1
like 1
this 1
vincent 1
spaulding 1
small 1
stoutbuilt 1
very 1
quick 1
in 1
his 1
ways 1
no 1
hair 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
though 1
hes 1
not 1
short 1
of 1
thirty 1
has 1
a 1
white 1
splash 1
of 1
acid 1
upon 1
his 1
forehead 1
holmes 1
sat 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
in 1
considerable 1
excitement 1
i 1
thought 1
as 1
much 1
said 1
he 1
have 1
you 1
ever 1
observed 1
that 1
his 1
ears 1
are 1
pierced 1
for 1
earrings 1
yes 1
sir 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
a 1
gipsy 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lad 1
hum 1
said 1
holmes 1
sinking 1
back 1
in 1
deep 1
thought 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
with 1
you 1
oh 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
left 1
him 1
and 1
has 1
your 1
business 1
been 1
attended 1
to 1
in 1
your 1
absence 1
nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
of 1
sir 1
theres 1
never 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
mr 1
wilson 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
opinion 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
today 1
is 1
saturday 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
by 1
monday 1
we 1
may 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
conclusion 1
well 1
watson 1
said 1
holmes 1
when 1
our 1
visitor 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
i 1
make 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
answered 1
frankly 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
mysterious 1
business 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
said 1
holmes 1
the 1
more 1
bizarre 1
a 1
thing 1
is 1
the 1
less 1
mysterious 1
it 1
proves 1
to 1
be 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
commonplace 1
featureless 1
crimes 1
which 1
are 1
really 1
puzzling 1
just 1
as 1
a 1
commonplace 1
face 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
difficult 1
to 1
identify 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
prompt 1
over 1
this 1
matter 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
to 1
smoke 1
he 1
answered 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
three 1
pipe 1
problem 1
and 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
wont 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
fifty 1
minutes 1
he 1
curled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
thin 1
knees 1
drawn 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
hawklike 1
nose 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
black 1
clay 1
pipe 1
thrusting 1
out 1
like 1
the 1
bill 1
of 1
some 1
strange 1
bird 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
conclusion 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
asleep 1
and 1
indeed 1
was 1
nodding 1
myself 1
when 1
he 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
gesture 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
pipe 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
sarasate 1
plays 1
at 1
the 1
st 1
jamess 1
hall 1
this 1
afternoon 1
he 1
remarked 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
watson 1
could 1
your 1
patients 1
spare 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
today 1
my 1
practice 1
is 1
never 1
very 1
absorbing 1
then 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
hat 1
and 1
come 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
city 1
first 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
some 1
lunch 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
observe 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
german 1
music 1
on 1
the 1
programme 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
taste 1
than 1
italian 1
or 1
french 1
it 1
is 1
introspective 1
and 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
introspect 1
come 1
along 1
we 1
travelled 1
by 1
the 1
underground 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
aldersgate 1
and 1
a 1
short 1
walk 1
took 1
us 1
to 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
story 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
poky 1
little 1
shabbygenteel 1
place 1
where 1
four 1
lines 1
of 1
dingy 1
twostoried 1
brick 1
houses 1
looked 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
railedin 1
enclosure 1
where 1
a 1
lawn 1
of 1
weedy 1
grass 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
clumps 1
of 1
faded 1
laurelbushes 1
made 1
a 1
hard 1
fight 1
against 1
a 1
smokeladen 1
and 1
uncongenial 1
atmosphere 1
three 1
gilt 1
balls 1
and 1
a 1
brown 1
board 1
with 1
jabez 1
wilson 1
in 1
white 1
letters 1
upon 1
a 1
corner 1
house 1
announced 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
our 1
redheaded 1
client 1
carried 1
on 1
his 1
business 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
stopped 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
looked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
shining 1
brightly 1
between 1
puckered 1
lids 1
then 1
he 1
walked 1
slowly 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
then 1
down 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
still 1
looking 1
keenly 1
at 1
the 1
houses 1
finally 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
pawnbrokers 1
and 1
having 1
thumped 1
vigorously 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
knocked 1
it 1
was 1
instantly 1
opened 1
by 1
a 1
brightlooking 1
cleanshaven 1
young 1
fellow 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
in 1
thank 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
i 1
only 1
wished 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
how 1
you 1
would 1
go 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
the 1
strand 1
third 1
right 1
fourth 1
left 1
answered 1
the 1
assistant 1
promptly 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
smart 1
fellow 1
that 1
observed 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
walked 1
away 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
judgment 1
the 1
fourth 1
smartest 1
man 1
in 1
london 1
and 1
for 1
daring 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
claim 1
to 1
be 1
third 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
something 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
evidently 1
said 1
i 1
mr 1
wilsons 1
assistant 1
counts 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
this 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
league 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
inquired 1
your 1
way 1
merely 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
see 1
him 1
not 1
him 1
what 1
then 1
the 1
knees 1
of 1
his 1
trousers 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
what 1
i 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
beat 1
the 1
pavement 1
my 1
dear 1
doctor 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
time 1
for 1
observation 1
not 1
for 1
talk 1
we 1
are 1
spies 1
in 1
an 1
enemys 1
country 1
we 1
know 1
something 1
of 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
let 1
us 1
now 1
explore 1
the 1
parts 1
which 1
lie 1
behind 1
it 1
the 1
road 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
as 1
we 1
turned 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
from 1
the 1
retired 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
presented 1
as 1
great 1
a 1
contrast 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
picture 1
does 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
arteries 1
which 1
conveyed 1
the 1
traffic 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
and 1
west 1
the 1
roadway 1
was 1
blocked 1
with 1
the 1
immense 1
stream 1
of 1
commerce 1
flowing 1
in 1
a 1
double 1
tide 1
inward 1
and 1
outward 1
while 1
the 1
footpaths 1
were 1
black 1
with 1
the 1
hurrying 1
swarm 1
of 1
pedestrians 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
realise 1
as 1
we 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
line 1
of 1
fine 1
shops 1
and 1
stately 1
business 1
premises 1
that 1
they 1
really 1
abutted 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
upon 1
the 1
faded 1
and 1
stagnant 1
square 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
quitted 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
said 1
holmes 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
glancing 1
along 1
the 1
line 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
just 1
to 1
remember 1
the 1
order 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
hobby 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
exact 1
knowledge 1
of 1
london 1
there 1
is 1
mortimers 1
the 1
tobacconist 1
the 1
little 1
newspaper 1
shop 1
the 1
coburg 1
branch 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
suburban 1
bank 1
the 1
vegetarian 1
restaurant 1
and 1
mcfarlanes 1
carriagebuilding 1
depot 1
that 1
carries 1
us 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
block 1
and 1
now 1
doctor 1
weve 1
done 1
our 1
work 1
so 1
its 1
time 1
we 1
had 1
some 1
play 1
a 1
sandwich 1
and 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
and 1
then 1
off 1
to 1
violinland 1
where 1
all 1
is 1
sweetness 1
and 1
delicacy 1
and 1
harmony 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
redheaded 1
clients 1
to 1
vex 1
us 1
with 1
their 1
conundrums 1
my 1
friend 1
was 1
an 1
enthusiastic 1
musician 1
being 1
himself 1
not 1
only 1
a 1
very 1
capable 1
performer 1
but 1
a 1
composer 1
of 1
no 1
ordinary 1
merit 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
stalls 1
wrapped 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
happiness 1
gently 1
waving 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
fingers 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
the 1
music 1
while 1
his 1
gently 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
languid 1
dreamy 1
eyes 1
were 1
as 1
unlike 1
those 1
of 1
holmes 1
the 1
sleuthhound 1
holmes 1
the 1
relentless 1
keenwitted 1
readyhanded 1
criminal 1
agent 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
to 1
conceive 1
in 1
his 1
singular 1
character 1
the 1
dual 1
nature 1
alternately 1
asserted 1
itself 1
and 1
his 1
extreme 1
exactness 1
and 1
astuteness 1
represented 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
thought 1
the 1
reaction 1
against 1
the 1
poetic 1
and 1
contemplative 1
mood 1
which 1
occasionally 1
predominated 1
in 1
him 1
the 1
swing 1
of 1
his 1
nature 1
took 1
him 1
from 1
extreme 1
languor 1
to 1
devouring 1
energy 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
knew 1
well 1
he 1
was 1
never 1
so 1
truly 1
formidable 1
as 1
when 1
for 1
days 1
on 1
end 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lounging 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
amid 1
his 1
improvisations 1
and 1
his 1
blackletter 1
editions 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
lust 1
of 1
the 1
chase 1
would 1
suddenly 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
brilliant 1
reasoning 1
power 1
would 1
rise 1
to 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
intuition 1
until 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
his 1
methods 1
would 1
look 1
askance 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
on 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
knowledge 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
other 1
mortals 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
that 1
afternoon 1
so 1
enwrapped 1
in 1
the 1
music 1
at 1
st 1
jamess 1
hall 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
an 1
evil 1
time 1
might 1
be 1
coming 1
upon 1
those 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
hunt 1
down 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
no 1
doubt 1
doctor 1
he 1
remarked 1
as 1
we 1
emerged 1
yes 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
business 1
to 1
do 1
which 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
hours 1
this 1
business 1
at 1
coburg 1
square 1
is 1
serious 1
why 1
serious 1
a 1
considerable 1
crime 1
is 1
in 1
contemplation 1
i 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
stop 1
it 1
but 1
today 1
being 1
saturday 1
rather 1
complicates 1
matters 1
i 1
shall 1
want 1
your 1
help 1
tonight 1
at 1
what 1
time 1
ten 1
will 1
be 1
early 1
enough 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
at 1
ten 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
i 1
say 1
doctor 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
some 1
little 1
danger 1
so 1
kindly 1
put 1
your 1
army 1
revolver 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
he 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
turned 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
among 1
the 1
crowd 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
more 1
dense 1
than 1
my 1
neighbours 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
always 1
oppressed 1
with 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
stupidity 1
in 1
my 1
dealings 1
with 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
here 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
and 1
yet 1
from 1
his 1
words 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
he 1
saw 1
clearly 1
not 1
only 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen 1
while 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
was 1
still 1
confused 1
and 1
grotesque 1
as 1
i 1
drove 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
in 1
kensington 1
i 1
thought 1
over 1
it 1
all 1
from 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
copier 1
of 1
the 1
encyclopaedia 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
visit 1
to 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
and 1
the 1
ominous 1
words 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
parted 1
from 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
this 1
nocturnal 1
expedition 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
go 1
armed 1
where 1
were 1
we 1
going 1
and 1
what 1
were 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
hint 1
from 1
holmes 1
that 1
this 1
smoothfaced 1
pawnbrokers 1
assistant 1
was 1
a 1
formidable 1
mana 1
man 1
who 1
might 1
play 1
a 1
deep 1
game 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
puzzle 1
it 1
out 1
but 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
matter 1
aside 1
until 1
night 1
should 1
bring 1
an 1
explanation 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
quarterpast 1
nine 1
when 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
park 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
oxford 1
street 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
two 1
hansoms 1
were 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
passage 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
from 1
above 1
on 1
entering 1
his 1
room 1
i 1
found 1
holmes 1
in 1
animated 1
conversation 1
with 1
two 1
men 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
recognised 1
as 1
peter 1
jones 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
agent 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
sadfaced 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
shiny 1
hat 1
and 1
oppressively 1
respectable 1
frockcoat 1
ha 1
our 1
party 1
is 1
complete 1
said 1
holmes 1
buttoning 1
up 1
his 1
peajacket 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
heavy 1
hunting 1
crop 1
from 1
the 1
rack 1
watson 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
know 1
mr 1
jones 1
of 1
scotland 1
yard 1
let 1
me 1
introduce 1
you 1
to 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
who 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
companion 1
in 1
tonights 1
adventure 1
were 1
hunting 1
in 1
couples 1
again 1
doctor 1
you 1
see 1
said 1
jones 1
in 1
his 1
consequential 1
way 1
our 1
friend 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
man 1
for 1
starting 1
a 1
chase 1
all 1
he 1
wants 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
dog 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
running 1
down 1
i 1
hope 1
a 1
wild 1
goose 1
may 1
not 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
chase 1
observed 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
gloomily 1
you 1
may 1
place 1
considerable 1
confidence 1
in 1
mr 1
holmes 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
police 1
agent 1
loftily 1
he 1
has 1
his 1
own 1
little 1
methods 1
which 1
are 1
if 1
he 1
wont 1
mind 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
theoretical 1
and 1
fantastic 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
makings 1
of 1
a 1
detective 1
in 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
as 1
in 1
that 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
sholto 1
murder 1
and 1
the 1
agra 1
treasure 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
more 1
nearly 1
correct 1
than 1
the 1
official 1
force 1
oh 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
mr 1
jones 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
stranger 1
with 1
deference 1
still 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
miss 1
my 1
rubber 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
saturday 1
night 1
for 1
sevenandtwenty 1
years 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
had 1
my 1
rubber 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
that 1
you 1

exciting 1

the 1
murderer 1
thief 1
smasher 1
and 1
forger 1

a 1
young 1
man 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
his 1
profession 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
my 1
bracelets 1
on 1
him 1
than 1
on 1
any 1
criminal 1
in 1
london 1
hes 1
a 1
remarkable 1
man 1
is 1
young 1
john 1
clay 1

grandfather 1

a 1
royal 1
duke 1
and 1
he 1
himself 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
eton 1
and 1
oxford 1
his 1
brain 1
is 1
as 1
cunning 1
as 1
his 1
fingers 1
and 1
though 1
we 1
meet 1
signs 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
every 1
turn 1
we 1
never 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
man 1
himself 1
hell 1
crack 1
a 1
crib 1
in 1
scotland 1
one 1
week 1
and 1

an 1
orphanage 1
in 1
cornwall 1
the 1
next 1
ive 1
been 1
on 1
his 1
track 1
for 1
years 1
and 1
have 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
yet 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
introducing 1
you 1
tonight 1
ive 1
had 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
little 1
turns 1
also 1
with 1
mr 1
john 1
clay 1
and 1
i 1
agree 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
his 1
profession 1
it 1
is 1
past 1
ten 1
however 1
and 1
quite 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
started 1
if 1
you 1
two 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
first 1
hansom 1
watson 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
follow 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
communicative 1
during 1
the 1
long 1
drive 1
and 1
lay 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
humming 1
the 1
tunes 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
we 1
rattled 1
through 1
an 1
endless 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
gaslit 1
streets 1
until 1
we 1
emerged 1
into 1
farrington 1
street 1
we 1
are 1
close 1
there 1
now 1
my 1
friend 1
remarked 1
this 1
fellow 1
merryweather 1
is 1
a 1
bank 1
director 1
and 1
personally 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
to 1
have 1
jones 1
with 1
us 1
also 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
fellow 1
though 1
an 1
absolute 1
imbecile 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
he 1
has 1
one 1
positive 1
virtue 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
brave 1
as 1
a 1
bulldog 1
and 1
as 1
tenacious 1
as 1
a 1
lobster 1
if 1
he 1
gets 1
his 1
claws 1
upon 1
anyone 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
we 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
same 1
crowded 1
thoroughfare 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
our 1
cabs 1
were 1
dismissed 1
and 1
following 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
we 1
passed 1
down 1
a 1
narrow 1
passage 1
and 1
through 1
a 1
side 1
door 1
which 1
he 1
opened 1
for 1
us 1
within 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
corridor 1
which 1
ended 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
massive 1
iron 1
gate 1
this 1
also 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
led 1
down 1
a 1
flight 1
of 1
winding 1
stone 1
steps 1
which 1
terminated 1
at 1
another 1
formidable 1
gate 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
stopped 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
lantern 1
and 1
then 1
conducted 1
us 1
down 1
a 1
dark 1
earthsmelling 1
passage 1
and 1
so 1
after 1
opening 1
a 1
third 1
door 1
into 1
a 1
huge 1
vault 1
or 1
cellar 1
which 1
was 1
piled 1
all 1
round 1
with 1
crates 1
and 1
massive 1
boxes 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
vulnerable 1
from 1
above 1
holmes 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
gazed 1
about 1
him 1
nor 1
from 1
below 1
said 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
striking 1
his 1
stick 1
upon 1
the 1
flags 1
which 1
lined 1
the 1
floor 1
why 1
dear 1
me 1
it 1
sounds 1
quite 1
hollow 1
he 1
remarked 1
looking 1
up 1
in 1
surprise 1
i 1
must 1
really 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
quiet 1
said 1
holmes 1
severely 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
imperilled 1
the 1
whole 1
success 1
of 1
our 1
expedition 1
might 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
boxes 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
interfere 1
the 1
solemn 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
perched 1
himself 1
upon 1
a 1
crate 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
injured 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
while 1
holmes 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
a 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
began 1
to 1
examine 1
minutely 1
the 1
cracks 1
between 1
the 1
stones 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
sufficed 1
to 1
satisfy 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
again 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
glass 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
we 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
us 1
he 1
remarked 1
for 1
they 1
can 1
hardly 1
take 1
any 1
steps 1
until 1
the 1
good 1
pawnbroker 1
is 1
safely 1
in 1
bed 1
then 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
lose 1
a 1
minute 1
for 1
the 1
sooner 1
they 1
do 1
their 1
work 1
the 1
longer 1
time 1
they 1
will 1
have 1
for 1
their 1
escape 1
we 1
are 1
at 1
present 1
doctoras 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
divinedin 1
the 1
cellar 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
branch 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
london 1
banks 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
is 1
the 1
chairman 1
of 1
directors 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
explain 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
reasons 1
why 1
the 1
more 1
daring 1
criminals 1
of 1
london 1
should 1
take 1
a 1
considerable 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
cellar 1
at 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
our 1
french 1
gold 1
whispered 1
the 1
director 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
several 1
warnings 1
that 1
an 1
attempt 1
might 1
be 1
made 1
upon 1
it 1
your 1
french 1
gold 1
yes 1
we 1
had 1
occasion 1
some 1
months 1
ago 1
to 1
strengthen 1
our 1
resources 1
and 1
borrowed 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
30000 1
napoleons 1
from 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
france 1
it 1
has 1
become 1
known 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
occasion 1
to 1
unpack 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
lying 1
in 1
our 1
cellar 1
the 1
crate 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
sit 1
contains 1
2000 1
napoleons 1
packed 1
between 1
layers 1
of 1
lead 1
foil 1
our 1
reserve 1
of 1
bullion 1
is 1
much 1
larger 1
at 1
present 1
than 1
is 1
usually 1
kept 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
branch 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
directors 1
have 1
had 1
misgivings 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
which 1
were 1
very 1
well 1
justified 1
observed 1
holmes 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
arranged 1
our 1
little 1
plans 1
i 1
expect 1
that 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
matters 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
head 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
we 1
must 1
put 1
the 1
screen 1
over 1
that 1
dark 1
lantern 1
and 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
cards 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
a 1
partie 1
carree 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
your 1
rubber 1
after 1
all 1
but 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
enemys 1
preparations 1
have 1
gone 1
so 1
far 1
that 1
we 1
cannot 1
risk 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
we 1
must 1
choose 1
our 1
positions 1
these 1
are 1
daring 1
men 1
and 1
though 1
we 1
shall 1
take 1
them 1
at 1
a 1
disadvantage 1
they 1
may 1
do 1
us 1
some 1
harm 1
unless 1
we 1
are 1
careful 1
i 1
shall 1
stand 1
behind 1
this 1
crate 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
conceal 1
yourselves 1
behind 1
those 1
then 1
when 1
i 1
flash 1
a 1
light 1
upon 1
them 1
close 1
in 1
swiftly 1
if 1
they 1
fire 1
watson 1
have 1
no 1
compunction 1
about 1
shooting 1
them 1
down 1
i 1
placed 1
my 1
revolver 1
cocked 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
wooden 1
case 1
behind 1
which 1
i 1
crouched 1
holmes 1
shot 1
the 1
slide 1
across 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
lantern 1
and 1
left 1
us 1
in 1
pitch 1
darknesssuch 1
an 1
absolute 1
darkness 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
hot 1
metal 1
remained 1
to 1
assure 1
us 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
ready 1
to 1
flash 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
moments 1
notice 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
my 1
nerves 1
worked 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
pitch 1
of 1
expectancy 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
depressing 1
and 1
subduing 1
in 1
the 1
sudden 1
gloom 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
dank 1
air 1
of 1
the 1
vault 1
they 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
retreat 1
whispered 1
holmes 1
that 1
is 1
back 1
through 1
the 1
house 1
into 1
saxecoburg 1
square 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
what 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
jones 1
i 1
have 1
an 1
inspector 1
and 1
two 1
officers 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
then 1
we 1
have 1
stopped 1
all 1
the 1
holes 1
and 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
silent 1
and 1
wait 1
what 1
a 1
time 1
it 1
seemed 1
from 1
comparing 1
notes 1
afterwards 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
yet 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
night 1
must 1
have 1
almost 1
gone 1
and 1
the 1
dawn 1
be 1
breaking 1
above 1
us 1
my 1
limbs 1
were 1
weary 1
and 1
stiff 1
for 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
position 1
yet 1
my 1
nerves 1
were 1
worked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
pitch 1
of 1
tension 1
and 1
my 1
hearing 1
was 1
so 1
acute 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
only 1
hear 1
the 1
gentle 1
breathing 1
of 1
my 1
companions 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
deeper 1
heavier 1
inbreath 1
of 1
the 1
bulky 1
jones 1
from 1
the 1
thin 1
sighing 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
director 1
from 1
my 1
position 1
i 1
could 1
look 1
over 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
suddenly 1
my 1
eyes 1
caught 1
the 1
glint 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
at 1
first 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
lurid 1
spark 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
pavement 1
then 1
it 1
lengthened 1
out 1
until 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
yellow 1
line 1
and 1
then 1
without 1
any 1
warning 1
or 1
sound 1
a 1
gash 1
seemed 1
to 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
hand 1
appeared 1
a 1
white 1
almost 1
womanly 1
hand 1
which 1
felt 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
area 1
of 1
light 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
more 1
the 1
hand 1
with 1
its 1
writhing 1
fingers 1
protruded 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
withdrawn 1
as 1
suddenly 1
as 1
it 1
appeared 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
dark 1
again 1
save 1
the 1
single 1
lurid 1
spark 1
which 1
marked 1
a 1
chink 1
between 1
the 1
stones 1
its 1
disappearance 1
however 1
was 1
but 1
momentary 1
with 1
a 1
rending 1
tearing 1
sound 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
broad 1
white 1
stones 1
turned 1
over 1
upon 1
its 1
side 1
and 1
left 1
a 1
square 1
gaping 1
hole 1
through 1
which 1
streamed 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
lantern 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
there 1
peeped 1
a 1
cleancut 1
boyish 1
face 1
which 1
looked 1
keenly 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
aperture 1
drew 1
itself 1
shoulderhigh 1
and 1
waisthigh 1
until 1
one 1
knee 1
rested 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
in 1
another 1
instant 1
he 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
was 1
hauling 1
after 1
him 1
a 1
companion 1
lithe 1
and 1
small 1
like 1
himself 1
with 1
a 1
pale 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
shock 1
of 1
very 1
red 1
hair 1
its 1
all 1
clear 1
he 1
whispered 1
have 1
you 1
the 1
chisel 1
and 1
the 1
bags 1
great 1
scott 1
jump 1
archie 1
jump 1
and 1
ill 1
swing 1
for 1
it 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had 1
sprung 1
out 1
and 1
seized 1
the 1
intruder 1
by 1
the 1
collar 1
the 1
other 1
dived 1
down 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
rending 1
cloth 1
as 1
jones 1
clutched 1
at 1
his 1
skirts 1
the 1
light 1
flashed 1
upon 1
the 1
barrel 1
of 1
a 1
revolver 1
but 1
holmes 1
hunting 1
crop 1
came 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
mans 1
wrist 1
and 1
the 1
pistol 1
clinked 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
floor 1
its 1
no 1
use 1
john 1
clay 1
said 1
holmes 1
blandly 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
at 1
all 1
so 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
coolness 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
my 1
pal 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
though 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
his 1
coattails 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
men 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
said 1
holmes 1
oh 1
indeed 1

seem 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
thing 1
very 1
completely 1
i 1
must 1
compliment 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
you 1
holmes 1
answered 1
your 1
redheaded 1
idea 1
was 1
very 1
new 1
and 1
effective 1
youll 1
see 1
your 1
pal 1
again 1
presently 1
said 1
jones 1
hes 1
quicker 1
at 1
climbing 1
down 1
holes 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
just 1
hold 1
out 1
while 1
i 1
fix 1
the 1
derbies 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
touch 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
filthy 1
hands 1
remarked 1
our 1
prisoner 1
as 1
the 1
handcuffs 1
clattered 1
upon 1
his 1
wrists 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
aware 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
royal 1
blood 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
also 1
when 1
you 1
address 1
me 1
always 1
to 1
say 1
sir 1
and 1
please 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
jones 1
with 1
a 1
stare 1
and 1
a 1
snigger 1
well 1
would 1
you 1
please 1
sir 1
march 1
upstairs 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
a 1
cab 1
to 1
carry 1
your 1
highness 1
to 1
the 1
policestation 1
that 1
is 1
better 1
said 1
john 1
clay 1
serenely 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sweeping 1
bow 1
to 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
walked 1
quietly 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
custody 1
of 1
the 1
detective 1
really 1
mr 1
holmes 1
said 1
mr 1
merryweather 1
as 1
we 1
followed 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
the 1
bank 1
can 1
thank 1
you 1
or 1
repay 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
detected 1
and 1
defeated 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
complete 1
manner 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
determined 1
attempts 1
at 1
bank 1
robbery 1
that 1
have 1
ever 1
come 1
within 1
my 1
experience 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
little 1
scores 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
to 1
settle 1
with 1
mr 1
john 1
clay 1
said 1
holmes 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
some 1
small 1
expense 1
over 1
this 1
matter 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
expect 1
the 1
bank 1
to 1
refund 1
but 1
beyond 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
amply 1
repaid 1
by 1
having 1
had 1
an 1
experience 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
many 1
ways 1
unique 1
and 1
by 1
hearing 1
the 1
very 1
remarkable 1
narrative 1
of 1
the 1
redheaded 1
league 1
you 1
see 1
watson 1
he 1
explained 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
over 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
whisky 1
and 1
soda 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
possible 1
object 1
of 1
this 1
rather 1
fantastic 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
advertisement 1
of 1
the 1
league 1
and 1
the 1
copying 1
of 1
the 1
encyclopaedia 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
get 1
this 1
not 1
overbright 1
pawnbroker 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
hours 1
every 1
day 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
curious 1
way 1
of 1
managing 1
it 1
but 1
really 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
difficult 1
to 1
suggest 1
a 1
better 1
the 1
method 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
suggested 1
to 1
clays 1
ingenious 1
mind 1
by 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
his 1
accomplices 1
hair 1
the 1
4 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
was 1
a 1
lure 1
which 1
must 1
draw 1
him 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
playing 1
for 1
thousands 1
they 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
advertisement 1
one 1
rogue 1
has 1
the 1
temporary 1
office 1
the 1
other 1
rogue 1
incites 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
apply 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
together 1
they 1
manage 1
to 1
secure 1
his 1
absence 1
every 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
week 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
assistant 1
having 1
come 1
for 1
half 1
wages 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
some 1
strong 1
motive 1
for 1
securing 1
the 1
situation 1
but 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
guess 1
what 1
the 1
motive 1
was 1
had 1
there 1
been 1
women 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
suspected 1
a 1
mere 1
vulgar 1
intrigue 1
that 1
however 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
the 1
mans 1
business 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
which 1
could 1
account 1
for 1
such 1
elaborate 1
preparations 1
and 1
such 1
an 1
expenditure 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
it 1
must 1
then 1
be 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
assistants 1
fondness 1
for 1
photography 1
and 1
his 1
trick 1
of 1
vanishing 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
the 1
cellar 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
tangled 1
clue 1
then 1
i 1
made 1
inquiries 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
mysterious 1
assistant 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
coolest 1
and 1
most 1
daring 1
criminals 1
in 1
london 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
cellarsomething 1
which 1
took 1
many 1
hours 1
a 1
day 1
for 1
months 1
on 1
end 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
once 1
more 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
a 1
tunnel 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
building 1
so 1
far 1
i 1
had 1
got 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
i 1
surprised 1
you 1
by 1
beating 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
with 1
my 1
stick 1
i 1
was 1
ascertaining 1
whether 1
the 1
cellar 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
or 1
behind 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
front 1
then 1
i 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
hoped 1
the 1
assistant 1
answered 1
it 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
skirmishes 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
upon 1
each 1
other 1
before 1
i 1
hardly 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
face 1
his 1
knees 1
were 1
what 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
must 1
yourself 1
have 1
remarked 1
how 1
worn 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
stained 1
they 1
were 1
they 1
spoke 1
of 1
those 1
hours 1
of 1
burrowing 1
the 1
only 1
remaining 1
point 1
was 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
burrowing 1
for 1
i 1
walked 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
saw 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
suburban 1
bank 1
abutted 1
on 1
our 1
friends 1
premises 1
and 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
solved 1
my 1
problem 1
when 1
you 1
drove 1
home 1
after 1
the 1
concert 1
i 1
called 1
upon 1
scotland 1
yard 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
chairman 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
directors 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
and 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
tell 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
their 1
attempt 1
tonight 1
i 1
asked 1
well 1
when 1
they 1
closed 1
their 1
league 1
offices 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
they 1
cared 1
no 1
longer 1
about 1
mr 1
jabez 1
wilsons 1
presencein 1
other 1
words 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
completed 1
their 1
tunnel 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
essential 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
use 1
it 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
discovered 1
or 1
the 1
bullion 1
might 1
be 1
removed 1
saturday 1
would 1
suit 1
them 1
better 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
day 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
their 1
escape 1
for 1
all 1
these 1
reasons 1
i 1
expected 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
tonight 1
you 1
reasoned 1
it 1
out 1
beautifully 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
unfeigned 1
admiration 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
chain 1
and 1
yet 1
every 1
link 1
rings 1
true 1
it 1
saved 1
me 1
from 1
ennui 1
he 1
answered 1
yawning 1
alas 1
i 1
already 1
feel 1
it 1
closing 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
my 1
life 1
is 1
spent 1
in 1
one 1
long 1
effort 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
commonplaces 1
of 1
existence 1
these 1
little 1
problems 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
benefactor 1
of 1
the 1
race 1
said 1
i 1
he 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
well 1
perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
some 1
little 1
use 1
he 1
remarked 1

sherlock 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1

on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
his 1
lodgings 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
life 1
is 1
infinitely 1
stranger 1
than 1
anything 1
which 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
man 1
could 1
invent 1
we 1
would 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
conceive 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
are 1
really 1
mere 1
commonplaces 1
of 1
existence 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
fly 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
window 1
hand 1
in 1
hand 1
hover 1
over 1
this 1
great 1
city 1
gently 1
remove 1
the 1
roofs 1
and 1
peep 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
queer 1
things 1
which 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
the 1
plannings 1
the 1
crosspurposes 1
the 1
wonderful 1
chains 1
of 1
events 1
working 1
through 1
generations 1
and 1
leading 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
outre 1
results 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
all 1
fiction 1
with 1
its 1
conventionalities 1
and 1
foreseen 1
conclusions 1
most 1
stale 1
and 1
unprofitable 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
convinced 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
answered 1
the 1
cases 1
which 1
come 1
to 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
papers 1
are 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
bald 1
enough 1
and 1
vulgar 1
enough 1
we 1
have 1
in 1
our 1
police 1
reports 1
realism 1
pushed 1
to 1
its 1
extreme 1
limits 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
result 1
is 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
confessed 1
neither 1
fascinating 1
nor 1
artistic 1
a 1
certain 1
selection 1
and 1
discretion 1
must 1
be 1
used 1
in 1
producing 1
a 1
realistic 1
effect 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
this 1
is 1
wanting 1
in 1
the 1
police 1
report 1
where 1
more 1
stress 1
is 1
laid 1
perhaps 1
upon 1
the 1
platitudes 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
than 1
upon 1
the 1
details 1
which 1
to 1
an 1
observer 1
contain 1
the 1
vital 1
essence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
matter 1
depend 1
upon 1
it 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
so 1
unnatural 1
as 1
the 1
commonplace 1
i 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
i 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
your 1
thinking 1
so 1
i 1
said 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
your 1
position 1
of 1
unofficial 1
adviser 1
and 1
helper 1
to 1
everybody 1
who 1
is 1
absolutely 1
puzzled 1
throughout 1
three 1
continents 1
you 1
are 1
brought 1
in 1
contact 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
strange 1
and 1
bizarre 1
but 1
herei 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
morning 1
paper 1
from 1
the 1
groundlet 1
us 1
put 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
practical 1
test 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
heading 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
come 1
a 1
husbands 1
cruelty 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
there 1
is 1
half 1
a 1
column 1
of 1
print 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
without 1
reading 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
perfectly 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
there 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
other 1
woman 1
the 1
drink 1
the 1
push 1
the 1
blow 1
the 1
bruise 1
the 1
sympathetic 1
sister 1
or 1
landlady 1
the 1
crudest 1
of 1
writers 1
could 1
invent 1
nothing 1
more 1
crude 1
indeed 1
your 1
example 1
is 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
one 1
for 1
your 1
argument 1
said 1
holmes 1
taking 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
glancing 1
his 1
eye 1
down 1
it 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
dundas 1
separation 1
case 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
happens 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
clearing 1
up 1
some 1
small 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
husband 1
was 1
a 1
teetotaler 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
conduct 1
complained 1
of 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
drifted 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
winding 1
up 1
every 1
meal 1
by 1
taking 1
out 1
his 1
false 1
teeth 1
and 1
hurling 1
them 1
at 1
his 1
wife 1
which 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
action 1
likely 1
to 1
occur 1
to 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
the 1
average 1
storyteller 1
take 1
a 1
pinch 1
of 1
snuff 1
doctor 1
and 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
scored 1
over 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
example 1
he 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
snuffbox 1
of 1
old 1
gold 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
amethyst 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
lid 1
its 1
splendour 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
contrast 1
to 1
his 1
homely 1
ways 1
and 1
simple 1
life 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
commenting 1
upon 1
it 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
forgot 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
you 1
for 1
some 1
weeks 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
souvenir 1
from 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
my 1
assistance 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
irene 1
adler 1
papers 1
and 1
the 1
ring 1
i 1
asked 1
glancing 1
at 1
a 1
remarkable 1
brilliant 1
which 1
sparkled 1
upon 1
his 1
finger 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
the 1
reigning 1
family 1
of 1
holland 1
though 1
the 1
matter 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
served 1
them 1
was 1
of 1
such 1
delicacy 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
confide 1
it 1
even 1
to 1
you 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
chronicle 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
problems 1
and 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
on 1
hand 1
just 1
now 1
i 1
asked 1
with 1
interest 1
some 1
ten 1
or 1
twelve 1
but 1
none 1
which 1
present 1
any 1
feature 1
of 1
interest 1
they 1
are 1
important 1
you 1
understand 1
without 1
being 1
interesting 1
indeed 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
usually 1
in 1
unimportant 1
matters 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
observation 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
quick 1
analysis 1
of 1
cause 1
and 1
effect 1
which 1
gives 1
the 1
charm 1
to 1
an 1
investigation 1
the 1
larger 1
crimes 1
are 1
apt 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
simpler 1
for 1
the 1
bigger 1
the 1
crime 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
is 1
the 1
motive 1
in 1
these 1
cases 1
save 1
for 1
one 1
rather 1
intricate 1
matter 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
referred 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
marseilles 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
which 1
presents 1
any 1
features 1
of 1
interest 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
however 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
something 1
better 1
before 1
very 1
many 1
minutes 1
are 1
over 1
for 1
this 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
clients 1
or 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
he 1
had 1
risen 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
between 1
the 1
parted 1
blinds 1
gazing 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
dull 1
neutraltinted 1
london 1
street 1
looking 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
opposite 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
large 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
fur 1
boa 1
round 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
curling 1
red 1
feather 1
in 1
a 1
broadbrimmed 1
hat 1
which 1
was 1
tilted 1
in 1
a 1
coquettish 1
duchess 1
of 1
devonshire 1
fashion 1
over 1
her 1
ear 1
from 1
under 1
this 1
great 1
panoply 1
she 1
peeped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
nervous 1
hesitating 1
fashion 1
at 1
our 1
windows 1
while 1
her 1
body 1
oscillated 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
fidgeted 1
with 1
her 1
glove 1
buttons 1
suddenly 1
with 1
a 1
plunge 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
swimmer 1
who 1
leaves 1
the 1
bank 1
she 1
hurried 1
across 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
clang 1
of 1
the 1
bell 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
those 1
symptoms 1
before 1
said 1
holmes 1
throwing 1
his 1
cigarette 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
oscillation 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
always 1
means 1
an 1
affaire 1
de 1
coeur 1
she 1
would 1
like 1
advice 1
but 1
is 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
delicate 1
for 1
communication 1
and 1
yet 1
even 1
here 1
we 1
may 1
discriminate 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
has 1
been 1
seriously 1
wronged 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
oscillates 1
and 1
the 1
usual 1
symptom 1
is 1
a 1
broken 1
bell 1
wire 1
here 1
we 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
love 1
matter 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
maiden 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
angry 1
as 1
perplexed 1
or 1
grieved 1
but 1
here 1
she 1
comes 1
in 1
person 1
to 1
resolve 1
our 1
doubts 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
tap 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
buttons 1
entered 1
to 1
announce 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
while 1
the 1
lady 1
herself 1
loomed 1
behind 1
his 1
small 1
black 1
figure 1
like 1
a 1
fullsailed 1
merchantman 1
behind 1
a 1
tiny 1
pilot 1
boat 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
welcomed 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
easy 1
courtesy 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
remarkable 1
and 1
having 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
bowed 1
her 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
he 1
looked 1
her 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
minute 1
and 1
yet 1
abstracted 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
peculiar 1
to 1
him 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
find 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
short 1
sight 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
trying 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
much 1
typewriting 1
i 1
did 1
at 1
first 1
she 1
answered 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
letters 1
are 1
without 1
looking 1
then 1
suddenly 1
realising 1
the 1
full 1
purport 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
she 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
astonishment 1
upon 1
her 1
broad 1
goodhumoured 1
face 1
youve 1
heard 1
about 1
me 1
mr 1
holmes 1
she 1
cried 1
else 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
never 1
mind 1
said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
business 1
to 1
know 1
things 1
perhaps 1
i 1
have 1
trained 1
myself 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
others 1
overlook 1
if 1
not 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
you 1
sir 1
because 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
from 1
mrs 1
etherege 1
whose 1
husband 1
you 1
found 1
so 1
easy 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
everyone 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
dead 1
oh 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
me 1
im 1
not 1
rich 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
right 1
besides 1
the 1
little 1
that 1
i 1
make 1
by 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
away 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
asked 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
with 1
his 1
fingertips 1
together 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
again 1
a 1
startled 1
look 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
somewhat 1
vacuous 1
face 1
of 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
yes 1
i 1
did 1
bang 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
she 1
said 1
for 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
angry 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
easy 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
mr 1
windibankthat 1
is 1
my 1
fathertook 1
it 1
all 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
nothing 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
saying 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
harm 1
done 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
mad 1
and 1
i 1
just 1
on 1
with 1
my 1
things 1
and 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
you 1
your 1
father 1
said 1
holmes 1
your 1
stepfather 1
surely 1
since 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
different 1
yes 1
my 1
stepfather 1
i 1
call 1
him 1
father 1
though 1
it 1
sounds 1
funny 1
too 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
only 1
five 1
years 1
and 1
two 1
months 1
older 1
than 1
myself 1
and 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
alive 1
oh 1
yes 1
mother 1
is 1
alive 1
and 1
well 1
i 1
wasnt 1
best 1
pleased 1
mr 1
holmes 1
when 1
she 1
married 1
again 1
so 1
soon 1
after 1
fathers 1
death 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
nearly 1
fifteen 1
years 1
younger 1
than 1
herself 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
plumber 1
in 1
the 1
tottenham 1
court 1
road 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
a 1
tidy 1
business 1
behind 1
him 1
which 1
mother 1
carried 1
on 1
with 1
mr 1
hardy 1
the 1
foreman 1
but 1
when 1
mr 1
windibank 1
came 1
he 1
made 1
her 1
sell 1
the 1
business 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
superior 1
being 1
a 1
traveller 1
in 1
wines 1
they 1
got 1
4700 1
pounds 1
for 1
the 1
goodwill 1
and 1
interest 1
which 1
wasnt 1
near 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
father 1
could 1
have 1
got 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
alive 1
i 1
had 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
impatient 1
under 1
this 1
rambling 1
and 1
inconsequential 1
narrative 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
he 1
had 1
listened 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
concentration 1
of 1
attention 1
your 1
own 1
little 1
income 1
he 1
asked 1
does 1
it 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
oh 1
no 1
sir 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
separate 1
and 1
was 1
left 1
me 1
by 1
my 1
uncle 1
ned 1
in 1
auckland 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
new 1
zealand 1
stock 1
paying 1
4 1
12 1
per 1
cent 1
two 1
thousand 1
five 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
was 1
the 1
amount 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
touch 1
the 1
interest 1
you 1
interest 1
me 1
extremely 1
said 1
holmes 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
draw 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
sum 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
with 1
what 1
you 1
earn 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
you 1
no 1
doubt 1
travel 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
indulge 1
yourself 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
a 1
single 1
lady 1
can 1
get 1
on 1
very 1
nicely 1
upon 1
an 1
income 1
of 1
about 1
60 1
pounds 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
with 1
much 1
less 1
than 1
that 1
mr 1
holmes 1
but 1
you 1
understand 1
that 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
live 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
dont 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
have 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
just 1
while 1
i 1
am 1
staying 1
with 1
them 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
is 1
only 1
just 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
mr 1
windibank 1
draws 1
my 1
interest 1
every 1
quarter 1
and 1
pays 1
it 1
over 1
to 1
mother 1
and 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
pretty 1
well 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
earn 1
at 1
typewriting 1
it 1
brings 1
me 1
twopence 1
a 1
sheet 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
often 1
do 1
from 1
fifteen 1
to 1
twenty 1
sheets 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
position 1
very 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
holmes 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
dr 1
watson 1
before 1
whom 1
you 1
can 1
speak 1
as 1
freely 1
as 1
before 1
myself 1
kindly 1
tell 1
us 1
now 1
all 1
about 1
your 1
connection 1
with 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
a 1
flush 1
stole 1
over 1
miss 1
sutherlands 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
picked 1
nervously 1
at 1
the 1
fringe 1
of 1
her 1
jacket 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
first 1
at 1
the 1
gasfitters 1
ball 1
she 1
said 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
send 1
father 1
tickets 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
then 1
afterwards 1
they 1
remembered 1
us 1
and 1
sent 1
them 1
to 1
mother 1
mr 1
windibank 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
wish 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
anywhere 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
quite 1
mad 1
if 1
i 1
wanted 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
join 1
a 1
sundayschool 1
treat 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
set 1
on 1
going 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
for 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
he 1
to 1
prevent 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
folk 1
were 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
know 1
when 1
all 1
fathers 1
friends 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
nothing 1
fit 1
to 1
wear 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
purple 1
plush 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
taken 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
drawer 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
nothing 1
else 1
would 1
do 1
he 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
france 1
upon 1
the 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
but 1
we 1
went 1
mother 1
and 1
i 1
with 1
mr 1
hardy 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
foreman 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
i 1
met 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
i 1
suppose 1
said 1
holmes 1
that 1
when 1
mr 1
windibank 1
came 1
back 1
from 1
france 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
annoyed 1
at 1
your 1
having 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
oh 1
well 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
laughed 1
i 1
remember 1
and 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
denying 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
for 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
way 1
i 1
see 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
gasfitters 1
ball 1
you 1
met 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
a 1
gentleman 1
called 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
next 1
day 1
to 1
ask 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
got 1
home 1
all 1
safe 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
met 1
himthat 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
met 1
him 1
twice 1
for 1
walks 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
father 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
any 1
more 1
no 1
well 1
you 1
know 1
father 1
didnt 1
like 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
any 1
visitors 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
woman 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
family 1
circle 1
but 1
then 1
as 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
mother 1
a 1
woman 1
wants 1
her 1
own 1
circle 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
mine 1
yet 1
but 1
how 1
about 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
did 1
he 1
make 1
no 1
attempt 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
well 1
father 1
was 1
going 1
off 1
to 1
france 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
hosmer 1
wrote 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safer 1
and 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
we 1
could 1
write 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
write 1
every 1
day 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
letters 1
in 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
for 1
father 1
to 1
know 1
were 1
you 1
engaged 1
to 1
the 1
gentleman 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
oh 1
yes 1
mr 1
holmes 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
walk 1
that 1
we 1
took 1
hosmermr 1
angelwas 1
a 1
cashier 1
in 1
an 1
office 1
in 1
leadenhall 1
streetand 1
what 1
office 1
thats 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
mr 1
holmes 1
i 1
dont 1
know 1
where 1
did 1
he 1
live 1
then 1
he 1
slept 1
on 1
the 1
premises 1
and 1
you 1
dont 1
know 1
his 1
address 1
noexcept 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
leadenhall 1
street 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
address 1
your 1
letters 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
leadenhall 1
street 1
post 1
office 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
till 1
called 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
chaffed 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
clerks 1
about 1
having 1
letters 1
from 1
a 1
lady 1
so 1
i 1
offered 1
to 1
typewrite 1
them 1
like 1
he 1
did 1
his 1
but 1
he 1
wouldnt 1
have 1
that 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
wrote 1
them 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
typewritten 1
he 1
always 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
machine 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
us 1
that 1
will 1
just 1
show 1
you 1
how 1
fond 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
me 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
suggestive 1
said 1
holmes 1
it 1
has 1
long 1
been 1
an 1
axiom 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
are 1
infinitely 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
can 1
you 1
remember 1
any 1
other 1
little 1
things 1
about 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
shy 1
man 1
mr 1
holmes 1
he 1
would 1
rather 1
walk 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
daylight 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
hated 1
to 1
be 1
conspicuous 1
very 1
retiring 1
and 1
gentlemanly 1
he 1
was 1
even 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
gentle 1
hed 1
had 1
the 1
quinsy 1
and 1
swollen 1
glands 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
weak 1
throat 1
and 1
a 1
hesitating 1
whispering 1
fashion 1
of 1
speech 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
well 1
dressed 1
very 1
neat 1
and 1
plain 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
weak 1
just 1
as 1
mine 1
are 1
and 1
he 1
wore 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
against 1
the 1
glare 1
well 1
and 1
what 1
happened 1
when 1
mr 1
windibank 1
your 1
stepfather 1
returned 1
to 1
france 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
and 1
proposed 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
marry 1
before 1
father 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
dreadful 1
earnest 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
swear 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
testament 1
that 1
whatever 1
happened 1
i 1
would 1
always 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
him 1
mother 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
swear 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
passion 1
mother 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
was 1
even 1
fonder 1
of 1
him 1
than 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
when 1
they 1
talked 1
of 1
marrying 1
within 1
the 1
week 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
ask 1
about 1
father 1
but 1
they 1
both 1
said 1
never 1
to 1
mind 1
about 1
father 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
afterwards 1
and 1
mother 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
all 1
right 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
didnt 1
quite 1
like 1
that 1
mr 1
holmes 1
it 1
seemed 1
funny 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
ask 1
his 1
leave 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
older 1
than 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
didnt 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
on 1
the 1
sly 1
so 1
i 1
wrote 1
to 1
father 1
at 1
bordeaux 1
where 1
the 1
company 1
has 1
its 1
french 1
offices 1
but 1
the 1
letter 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
it 1
missed 1
him 1
then 1
yes 1
sir 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
england 1
just 1
before 1
it 1
arrived 1
ha 1
that 1
was 1
unfortunate 1
your 1
wedding 1
was 1
arranged 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
friday 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
church 1
yes 1
sir 1
but 1
very 1
quietly 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
st 1
saviours 1
near 1
kings 1
cross 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
breakfast 1
afterwards 1
at 1
the 1
st 1
pancras 1
hotel 1
hosmer 1
came 1
for 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
he 1
put 1
us 1
both 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
stepped 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
fourwheeler 1
which 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
other 1
cab 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
first 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
fourwheeler 1
drove 1
up 1
we 1
waited 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
out 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
cabman 1
got 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
looked 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
there 1
the 1
cabman 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
get 1
in 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
that 1
was 1
last 1
friday 1
mr 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
or 1
heard 1
anything 1
since 1
then 1
to 1
throw 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
him 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
shamefully 1
treated 1
said 1
holmes 1
oh 1
no 1
sir 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
leave 1
me 1
so 1
why 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
whatever 1
happened 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
and 1
that 1
even 1
if 1
something 1
quite 1
unforeseen 1
occurred 1
to 1
separate 1
us 1
i 1
was 1
always 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
pledged 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
claim 1
his 1
pledge 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
it 1
seemed 1
strange 1
talk 1
for 1
a 1
weddingmorning 1
but 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
since 1
gives 1
a 1
meaning 1
to 1
it 1
most 1
certainly 1
it 1
does 1
your 1
own 1
opinion 1
is 1
then 1
that 1
some 1
unforeseen 1
catastrophe 1
has 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
foresaw 1
some 1
danger 1
or 1
else 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
talked 1
so 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
foresaw 1
happened 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
notion 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
none 1
one 1
more 1
question 1
how 1
did 1
your 1
mother 1
take 1
the 1
matter 1
she 1
was 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
again 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
did 1
you 1
tell 1
him 1
yes 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
hear 1
of 1
hosmer 1
again 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
interest 1
could 1
anyone 1
have 1
in 1
bringing 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
then 1
leaving 1
me 1
now 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
borrowed 1
my 1
money 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
married 1
me 1
and 1
got 1
my 1
money 1
settled 1
on 1
him 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
some 1
reason 1
but 1
hosmer 1
was 1
very 1
independent 1
about 1
money 1
and 1
never 1
would 1
look 1
at 1
a 1
shilling 1
of 1
mine 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
and 1
why 1
could 1
he 1
not 1
write 1
oh 1
it 1
drives 1
me 1
halfmad 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
cant 1
sleep 1
a 1
wink 1
at 1
night 1
she 1
pulled 1
a 1
little 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
muff 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sob 1
heavily 1
into 1
it 1
i 1
shall 1
glance 1
into 1
the 1
case 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
rising 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
reach 1
some 1
definite 1
result 1
let 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
rest 1
upon 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
your 1
mind 1
dwell 1
upon 1
it 1
further 1
above 1
all 1
try 1
to 1
let 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
vanish 1
from 1
your 1
memory 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
from 1
your 1
life 1
then 1
you 1
dont 1
think 1
ill 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
i 1
fear 1
not 1
then 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
will 1
leave 1
that 1
question 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
an 1
accurate 1
description 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
any 1
letters 1
of 1
his 1
which 1
you 1
can 1
spare 1
i 1
advertised 1
for 1
him 1
in 1
last 1
saturdays 1
chronicle 1
said 1
she 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
slip 1
and 1
here 1
are 1
four 1
letters 1
from 1
him 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
address 1
no 1
31 1
lyon 1
place 1
camberwell 1
mr 1
angels 1
address 1
you 1
never 1
had 1
i 1
understand 1
where 1
is 1
your 1
fathers 1
place 1
of 1
business 1
he 1
travels 1
for 1
westhouse 1
marbank 1
the 1
great 1
claret 1
importers 1
of 1
fenchurch 1
street 1
thank 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
statement 1
very 1
clearly 1
you 1
will 1
leave 1
the 1
papers 1
here 1
and 1
remember 1
the 1
advice 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
let 1
the 1
whole 1
incident 1
be 1
a 1
sealed 1
book 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
allow 1
it 1
to 1
affect 1
your 1
life 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
kind 1
mr 1
holmes 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
do 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
hosmer 1
he 1
shall 1
find 1
me 1
ready 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
back 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
preposterous 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
vacuous 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
noble 1
in 1
the 1
simple 1
faith 1
of 1
our 1
visitor 1
which 1
compelled 1
our 1
respect 1
she 1
laid 1
her 1
little 1
bundle 1
of 1
papers 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
promise 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
whenever 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
summoned 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
sat 1
silent 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
fingertips 1
still 1
pressed 1
together 1
his 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
gaze 1
directed 1
upward 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
rack 1
the 1
old 1
and 1
oily 1
clay 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
counsellor 1
and 1
having 1
lit 1
it 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
thick 1
blue 1
cloudwreaths 1
spinning 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
infinite 1
languor 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
quite 1
an 1
interesting 1
study 1
that 1
maiden 1
he 1
observed 1
i 1
found 1
her 1
more 1
interesting 1
than 1
her 1
little 1
problem 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
trite 1
one 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
parallel 1
cases 1
if 1
you 1
consult 1
my 1
index 1
in 1
andover 1
in 1
77 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
at 1
the 1
hague 1
last 1
year 1
old 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
idea 1
however 1
there 1
were 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
details 1
which 1
were 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
maiden 1
herself 1
was 1
most 1
instructive 1
you 1
appeared 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
upon 1
her 1
which 1
was 1
quite 1
invisible 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
remarked 1
not 1
invisible 1
but 1
unnoticed 1
watson 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
look 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
missed 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
important 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
bring 1
you 1
to 1
realise 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
sleeves 1
the 1
suggestiveness 1
of 1
thumbnails 1
or 1
the 1
great 1
issues 1
that 1
may 1
hang 1
from 1
a 1
bootlace 1
now 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
that 1
womans 1
appearance 1
describe 1
it 1
well 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
slatecoloured 1
broadbrimmed 1
straw 1
hat 1
with 1
a 1
feather 1
of 1
a 1
brickish 1
red 1
her 1
jacket 1
was 1
black 1
with 1
black 1
beads 1
sewn 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
fringe 1
of 1
little 1
black 1
jet 1
ornaments 1
her 1
dress 1
was 1
brown 1
rather 1
darker 1
than 1
coffee 1
colour 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
purple 1
plush 1
at 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
sleeves 1
her 1
gloves 1
were 1
greyish 1
and 1
were 1
worn 1
through 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
forefinger 1
her 1
boots 1
i 1
didnt 1
observe 1
she 1
had 1
small 1
round 1
hanging 1
gold 1
earrings 1
and 1
a 1
general 1
air 1
of 1
being 1
fairly 1
welltodo 1
in 1
a 1
vulgar 1
comfortable 1
easygoing 1
way 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
clapped 1
his 1
hands 1
softly 1
together 1
and 1
chuckled 1
pon 1
my 1
word 1
watson 1
you 1
are 1
coming 1
along 1
wonderfully 1
you 1
have 1
really 1
done 1
very 1
well 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
missed 1
everything 1
of 1
importance 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
hit 1
upon 1
the 1
method 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
quick 1
eye 1
for 1
colour 1
never 1
trust 1
to 1
general 1
impressions 1
my 1
boy 1
but 1
concentrate 1
yourself 1
upon 1
details 1
my 1
first 1
glance 1
is 1
always 1
at 1
a 1
womans 1
sleeve 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
perhaps 1
better 1
first 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
knee 1
of 1
the 1
trouser 1
as 1
you 1
observe 1
this 1
woman 1
had 1
plush 1
upon 1
her 1
sleeves 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
useful 1
material 1
for 1
showing 1
traces 1
the 1
double 1
line 1
a 1
little 1
above 1
the 1
wrist 1
where 1
the 1
typewritist 1
presses 1
against 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
beautifully 1
defined 1
the 1
sewingmachine 1
of 1
the 1
hand 1
type 1
leaves 1
a 1
similar 1
mark 1
but 1
only 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
arm 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
farthest 1
from 1
the 1
thumb 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
broadest 1
part 1
as 1
this 1
was 1
i 1
then 1
glanced 1
at 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
observing 1
the 1
dint 1
of 1
a 1
pincenez 1
at 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
nose 1
i 1
ventured 1
a 1
remark 1
upon 1
short 1
sight 1
and 1
typewriting 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
surprise 1
her 1
it 1
surprised 1
me 1
but 1
surely 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
much 1
surprised 1
and 1
interested 1
on 1
glancing 1
down 1
to 1
observe 1
that 1
though 1
the 1
boots 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
wearing 1
were 1
not 1
unlike 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
were 1
really 1
odd 1
ones 1
the 1
one 1
having 1
a 1
slightly 1
decorated 1
toecap 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
plain 1
one 1
one 1
was 1
buttoned 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
two 1
lower 1
buttons 1
out 1
of 1
five 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
third 1
and 1
fifth 1
now 1
when 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
otherwise 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
has 1
come 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
with 1
odd 1
boots 1
halfbuttoned 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
great 1
deduction 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
what 1
else 1
i 1
asked 1
keenly 1
interested 1
as 1
i 1
always 1
was 1
by 1
my 1
friends 1
incisive 1
reasoning 1
i 1
noted 1
in 1
passing 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
written 1
a 1
note 1
before 1
leaving 1
home 1
but 1
after 1
being 1
fully 1
dressed 1
you 1
observed 1
that 1
her 1
right 1
glove 1
was 1
torn 1
at 1
the 1
forefinger 1
but 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
apparently 1
see 1
that 1
both 1
glove 1
and 1
finger 1
were 1
stained 1
with 1
violet 1
ink 1
she 1
had 1
written 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
dipped 1
her 1
pen 1
too 1
deep 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
this 1
morning 1
or 1
the 1
mark 1
would 1
not 1
remain 1
clear 1
upon 1
the 1
finger 1
all 1
this 1
is 1
amusing 1
though 1
rather 1
elementary 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
business 1
watson 1
would 1
you 1
mind 1
reading 1
me 1
the 1
advertised 1
description 1
of 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
i 1
held 1
the 1
little 1
printed 1
slip 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
missing 1
it 1
said 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
fourteenth 1
a 1
gentleman 1
named 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
about 1
five 1
ft 1
seven 1
in 1
in 1
height 1
strongly 1
built 1
sallow 1
complexion 1
black 1
hair 1
a 1
little 1
bald 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
bushy 1
black 1
sidewhiskers 1
and 1
moustache 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
slight 1
infirmity 1
of 1
speech 1
was 1
dressed 1
when 1
last 1
seen 1
in 1
black 1
frockcoat 1
faced 1
with 1
silk 1
black 1
waistcoat 1
gold 1
albert 1

and 1
grey 1
harris 1
tweed 1
trousers 1
with 1
brown 1
gaiters 1
over 1
elasticsided 1
boots 1
known 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
employed 1
in 1
an 1
office 1
in 1
leadenhall 1
street 1
anybody 1
bringing 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
letters 1
he 1
continued 1
glancing 1
over 1
them 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
commonplace 1
absolutely 1
no 1
clue 1
in 1
them 1
to 1
mr 1
angel 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
quotes 1
balzac 1
once 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
remarkable 1
point 1
however 1
which 1
will 1
no 1
doubt 1
strike 1
you 1
they 1
are 1
typewritten 1
i 1
remarked 1
not 1
only 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
signature 1
is 1
typewritten 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
neat 1
little 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
date 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
no 1
superscription 1
except 1
leadenhall 1
street 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
vague 1
the 1
point 1
about 1
the 1
signature 1
is 1
very 1
suggestivein 1
fact 1
we 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
conclusive 1
of 1
what 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
how 1
strongly 1
it 1
bears 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
i 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
deny 1
his 1
signature 1
if 1
an 1
action 1
for 1
breach 1
of 1
promise 1
were 1
instituted 1
no 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
point 1
however 1
i 1
shall 1
write 1
two 1
letters 1
which 1
should 1
settle 1
the 1
matter 1
one 1
is 1
to 1
a 1
firm 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
the 1
other 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
ladys 1
stepfather 1
mr 1
windibank 1
asking 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
could 1
meet 1
us 1
here 1
at 1
six 1
oclock 1
tomorrow 1
evening 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
business 1
with 1
the 1
male 1
relatives 1
and 1
now 1
doctor 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
the 1
answers 1
to 1
those 1
letters 1
come 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
put 1
our 1
little 1
problem 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
for 1
the 1
interim 1
i 1
had 1
had 1
so 1
many 1
reasons 1
to 1
believe 1
in 1
my 1
friends 1
subtle 1
powers 1
of 1
reasoning 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
in 1
action 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
solid 1
grounds 1
for 1
the 1
assured 1
and 1
easy 1
demeanour 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
treated 1
the 1
singular 1
mystery 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
fathom 1
once 1
only 1
had 1
i 1
known 1
him 1
to 1
fail 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
bohemia 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
irene 1
adler 1
photograph 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
weird 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
sign 1
of 1
four 1
and 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
circumstances 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
study 1
in 1
scarlet 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
strange 1
tangle 1
indeed 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
unravel 1
i 1
left 1
him 1
then 1
still 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
black 1
clay 1
pipe 1
with 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
again 1
on 1
the 1
next 1
evening 1
i 1
would 1
find 1
that 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
all 1
the 1
clues 1
which 1
would 1
lead 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
disappearing 1
bridegroom 1
of 1
miss 1
mary 1
sutherland 1
a 1
professional 1
case 1
of 1
great 1
gravity 1
was 1
engaging 1
my 1
own 1
attention 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
next 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
busy 1
at 1
the 1
bedside 1
of 1
the 1
sufferer 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
close 1
upon 1
six 1
oclock 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
free 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
spring 1
into 1
a 1
hansom 1
and 1
drive 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
half 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
assist 1
at 1
the 1
denouement 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
mystery 1
i 1
found 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
alone 1
however 1
half 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
form 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
recesses 1
of 1
his 1
armchair 1
a 1
formidable 1
array 1
of 1
bottles 1
and 1
testtubes 1
with 1
the 1
pungent 1
cleanly 1
smell 1
of 1
hydrochloric 1
acid 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
his 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
chemical 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
well 1
have 1
you 1
solved 1
it 1
i 1
asked 1
as 1
i 1
entered 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
bisulphate 1
of 1
baryta 1
no 1
no 1
the 1
mystery 1
i 1
cried 1
oh 1
that 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
salt 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
working 1
upon 1
there 1
was 1
never 1
any 1
mystery 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
though 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
yesterday 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
details 1
are 1
of 1
interest 1
the 1
only 1
drawback 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
law 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
can 1
touch 1
the 1
scoundrel 1
who 1
was 1
he 1
then 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
his 1
object 1
in 1
deserting 1
miss 1
sutherland 1
the 1
question 1
was 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
holmes 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
opened 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
reply 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
heavy 1
footfall 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
tap 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
girls 1
stepfather 1
mr 1
james 1
windibank 1
said 1
holmes 1
he 1
has 1
written 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
six 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
a 1
sturdy 1
middlesized 1
fellow 1
some 1
thirty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
cleanshaven 1
and 1
sallowskinned 1
with 1
a 1
bland 1
insinuating 1
manner 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
wonderfully 1
sharp 1
and 1
penetrating 1
grey 1
eyes 1
he 1
shot 1
a 1
questioning 1
glance 1
at 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
placed 1
his 1
shiny 1
tophat 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
bow 1
sidled 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
nearest 1
chair 1
goodevening 1
mr 1
james 1
windibank 1
said 1
holmes 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
typewritten 1
letter 1
is 1
from 1
you 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
made 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
six 1
oclock 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
late 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
miss 1
sutherland 1
has 1
troubled 1
you 1
about 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
for 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
far 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
wash 1
linen 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
in 1
public 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
against 1
my 1
wishes 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
excitable 1
impulsive 1
girl 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
noticed 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
easily 1
controlled 1
when 1
she 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
on 1
a 1
point 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
pleasant 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
family 1
misfortune 1
like 1
this 1
noised 1
abroad 1
besides 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
useless 1
expense 1
for 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
possibly 1
find 1
this 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
holmes 1
quietly 1
i 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
succeed 1
in 1
discovering 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
mr 1
windibank 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
gloves 1
i 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
curious 1
thing 1
remarked 1
holmes 1
that 1
a 1
typewriter 1
has 1
really 1
quite 1
as 1
much 1
individuality 1
as 1
a 1
mans 1
handwriting 1
unless 1
they 1
are 1
quite 1
new 1
no 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
write 1
exactly 1
alike 1
some 1
letters 1
get 1
more 1
worn 1
than 1
others 1
and 1
some 1
wear 1
only 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
now 1
you 1
remark 1
in 1
this 1
note 1
of 1
yours 1
mr 1
windibank 1
that 1
in 1
every 1
case 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
little 1
slurring 1
over 1
of 1
the 1
e 1
and 1
a 1
slight 1
defect 1
in 1
the 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
r 1
there 1
are 1
fourteen 1
other 1
characteristics 1
but 1
those 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
we 1
do 1
all 1
our 1
correspondence 1
with 1
this 1
machine 1
at 1
the 1
office 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
worn 1
our 1
visitor 1
answered 1
glancing 1
keenly 1
at 1
holmes 1
with 1
his 1
bright 1
little 1
eyes 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
interesting 1
study 1
mr 1
windibank 1
holmes 1
continued 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
writing 1
another 1
little 1
monograph 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
on 1
the 1
typewriter 1
and 1
its 1
relation 1
to 1
crime 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
subject 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
devoted 1
some 1
little 1
attention 1
i 1
have 1
here 1
four 1
letters 1
which 1
purport 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
typewritten 1
in 1
each 1
case 1
not 1
only 1
are 1
the 1
es 1
slurred 1
and 1
the 1
rs 1
tailless 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
use 1
my 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
that 1
the 1
fourteen 1
other 1
characteristics 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
alluded 1
are 1
there 1
as 1
well 1
mr 1
windibank 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
i 1
cannot 1
waste 1
time 1
over 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
fantastic 1
talk 1
mr 1
holmes 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
catch 1
the 1
man 1
catch 1
him 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
certainly 1
said 1
holmes 1
stepping 1
over 1
and 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
i 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
caught 1
him 1
what 1
where 1
shouted 1
mr 1
windibank 1
turning 1
white 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
glancing 1
about 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
rat 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
oh 1
it 1
wont 1
doreally 1
it 1
wont 1
said 1
holmes 1
suavely 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
possible 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
mr 1
windibank 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
too 1
transparent 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
compliment 1
when 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
solve 1
so 1
simple 1
a 1
question 1
thats 1
right 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
our 1
visitor 1
collapsed 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
with 1
a 1
ghastly 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
glitter 1
of 1
moisture 1
on 1
his 1
brow 1
itits 1
not 1
actionable 1
he 1
stammered 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
but 1
between 1
ourselves 1
windibank 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
cruel 1
and 1
selfish 1
and 1
heartless 1
a 1
trick 1
in 1
a 1
petty 1
way 1
as 1
ever 1
came 1
before 1
me 1
now 1
let 1
me 1
just 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
contradict 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
go 1
wrong 1
the 1
man 1
sat 1
huddled 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
utterly 1
crushed 1
holmes 1
stuck 1
his 1
feet 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
and 1
leaning 1
back 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
began 1
talking 1
rather 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
than 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
man 1
married 1
a 1
woman 1
very 1
much 1
older 1
than 1
himself 1
for 1
her 1
money 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
of 1
the 1
daughter 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
lived 1
with 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
for 1
people 1
in 1
their 1
position 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
serious 1
difference 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
preserve 1
it 1
the 1
daughter 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
good 1
amiable 1
disposition 1
but 1
affectionate 1
and 1
warmhearted 1
in 1
her 1
ways 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
with 1
her 1
fair 1
personal 1
advantages 1
and 1
her 1
little 1
income 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
remain 1
single 1
long 1
now 1
her 1
marriage 1
would 1
mean 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
what 1
does 1
her 1
stepfather 1
do 1
to 1
prevent 1
it 1
he 1
takes 1
the 1
obvious 1
course 1
of 1
keeping 1
her 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
forbidding 1
her 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
people 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
age 1
but 1
soon 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
answer 1
forever 1
she 1
became 1
restive 1
insisted 1
upon 1
her 1
rights 1
and 1
finally 1
announced 1
her 1
positive 1
intention 1
of 1
going 1
to 1
a 1
certain 1
ball 1
what 1
does 1
her 1
clever 1
stepfather 1
do 1
then 1
he 1
conceives 1
an 1
idea 1
more 1
creditable 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
than 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
with 1
the 1
connivance 1
and 1
assistance 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
he 1
disguised 1
himself 1
covered 1
those 1
keen 1
eyes 1
with 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
masked 1
the 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
moustache 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
bushy 1
whiskers 1
sunk 1
that 1
clear 1
voice 1
into 1
an 1
insinuating 1
whisper 1
and 1
doubly 1
secure 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
girls 1
short 1
sight 1
he 1
appears 1
as 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
and 1
keeps 1
off 1
other 1
lovers 1
by 1
making 1
love 1
himself 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
joke 1
at 1
first 1
groaned 1
our 1
visitor 1
we 1
never 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
carried 1
away 1
very 1
likely 1
not 1
however 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
was 1
very 1
decidedly 1
carried 1
away 1
and 1
having 1
quite 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
that 1
her 1
stepfather 1
was 1
in 1
france 1
the 1
suspicion 1
of 1
treachery 1
never 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
entered 1
her 1
mind 1
she 1
was 1
flattered 1
by 1
the 1
gentlemans 1
attentions 1
and 1
the 1
effect 1
was 1
increased 1
by 1
the 1
loudly 1
expressed 1
admiration 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
then 1
mr 1
angel 1
began 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
should 1
be 1
pushed 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
go 1
if 1
a 1
real 1
effect 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
produced 1
there 1
were 1
meetings 1
and 1
an 1
engagement 1
which 1
would 1
finally 1
secure 1
the 1
girls 1
affections 1
from 1
turning 1
towards 1
anyone 1
else 1
but 1
the 1
deception 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
kept 1
up 1
forever 1
these 1
pretended 1
journeys 1
to 1
france 1
were 1
rather 1
cumbrous 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
clearly 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
business 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
dramatic 1
manner 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
leave 1
a 1
permanent 1
impression 1
upon 1
the 1
young 1
ladys 1
mind 1
and 1
prevent 1
her 1
from 1
looking 1
upon 1
any 1
other 1
suitor 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
hence 1
those 1
vows 1
of 1
fidelity 1
exacted 1
upon 1
a 1
testament 1
and 1
hence 1
also 1
the 1
allusions 1
to 1
a 1
possibility 1
of 1
something 1
happening 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
james 1
windibank 1
wished 1
miss 1
sutherland 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
bound 1
to 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
and 1
so 1
uncertain 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
fate 1
that 1
for 1
ten 1
years 1
to 1
come 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
another 1
man 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
he 1
brought 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
he 1
conveniently 1
vanished 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
trick 1
of 1
stepping 1
in 1
at 1
one 1
door 1
of 1
a 1
fourwheeler 1
and 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
mr 1
windibank 1
our 1
visitor 1
had 1
recovered 1
something 1
of 1
his 1
assurance 1
while 1
holmes 1
had 1
been 1
talking 1
and 1
he 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
sneer 1
upon 1
his 1
pale 1
face 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
or 1
it 1
may 1
not 1
mr 1
holmes 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
very 1
sharp 1
you 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
sharp 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
who 1
are 1
breaking 1
the 1
law 1
now 1
and 1
not 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
nothing 1
actionable 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
but 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
keep 1
that 1
door 1
locked 1
you 1
lay 1
yourself 1
open 1
to 1
an 1
action 1
for 1
assault 1
and 1
illegal 1
constraint 1
the 1
law 1
cannot 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
touch 1
you 1
said 1
holmes 1
unlocking 1
and 1
throwing 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
yet 1
there 1
never 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
deserved 1
punishment 1
more 1
if 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
has 1
a 1
brother 1
or 1
a 1
friend 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
lay 1
a 1
whip 1
across 1
your 1
shoulders 1
by 1
jove 1
he 1
continued 1
flushing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
bitter 1
sneer 1
upon 1
the 1
mans 1
face 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
duties 1
to 1
my 1
client 1
but 1
heres 1
a 1
hunting 1
crop 1
handy 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
shall 1
just 1
treat 1
myself 1
to 1
he 1
took 1
two 1
swift 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
whip 1
but 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
grasp 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
clatter 1
of 1
steps 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
heavy 1
hall 1
door 1
banged 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
mr 1
james 1
windibank 1
running 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
speed 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
theres 1
a 1
coldblooded 1
scoundrel 1
said 1
holmes 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
once 1
more 1
that 1
fellow 1
will 1
rise 1
from 1
crime 1
to 1
crime 1
until 1
he 1
does 1
something 1
very 1
bad 1
and 1
ends 1
on 1
a 1
gallows 1
the 1
case 1
has 1
in 1
some 1
respects 1
been 1
not 1
entirely 1
devoid 1
of 1
interest 1
i 1
cannot 1
now 1
entirely 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
your 1
reasoning 1
i 1
remarked 1
well 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
this 1
mr 1
hosmer 1
angel 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
strong 1
object 1
for 1
his 1
curious 1
conduct 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
equally 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
who 1
really 1
profited 1
by 1
the 1
incident 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
was 1
the 1
stepfather 1
then 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
were 1
never 1
together 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
always 1
appeared 1
when 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
away 1
was 1
suggestive 1
so 1
were 1
the 1
tinted 1
spectacles 1
and 1
the 1
curious 1
voice 1
which 1
both 1
hinted 1
at 1
a 1
disguise 1
as 1
did 1
the 1
bushy 1
whiskers 1
my 1
suspicions 1
were 1
all 1
confirmed 1
by 1
his 1
peculiar 1
action 1
in 1
typewriting 1
his 1
signature 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
inferred 1
that 1
his 1
handwriting 1
was 1
so 1
familiar 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
recognise 1
even 1
the 1
smallest 1
sample 1
of 1
it 1
you 1
see 1
all 1
these 1
isolated 1
facts 1
together 1
with 1
many 1
minor 1
ones 1
all 1
pointed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
direction 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
verify 1
them 1
having 1
once 1
spotted 1
my 1
man 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
get 1
corroboration 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
firm 1
for 1
which 1
this 1
man 1
worked 1
having 1
taken 1
the 1
printed 1
description 1
i 1
eliminated 1
everything 1
from 1
it 1
which 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
a 1
disguisethe 1
whiskers 1
the 1
glasses 1
the 1
voice 1
and 1
i 1
sent 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
firm 1
with 1
a 1
request 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
inform 1
me 1
whether 1
it 1
answered 1
to 1
the 1
description 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
their 1
travellers 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
noticed 1
the 1
peculiarities 1
of 1
the 1
typewriter 1
and 1
i 1
wrote 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
business 1
address 1
asking 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
here 1
as 1
i 1
expected 1
his 1
reply 1
was 1
typewritten 1
and 1
revealed 1
the 1
same 1
trivial 1
but 1
characteristic 1
defects 1
the 1
same 1
post 1
brought 1
me 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
westhouse 1
marbank 1
of 1
fenchurch 1
street 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
description 1
tallied 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
their 1
employe 1
james 1
windibank 1
voila 1
tout 1
and 1
miss 1
sutherland 1
if 1
i 1
tell 1
her 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
believe 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
the 1
old 1
persian 1
saying 1
there 1
is 1
danger 1
for 1
him 1
who 1
taketh 1
the 1
tiger 1
cub 1
and 1
danger 1
also 1
for 1
whoso 1
snatches 1
a 1
delusion 1
from 1
a 1
woman 1
there 1
is 1
as 1
much 1
sense 1
in 1
hafiz 1
as 1
in 1
horace 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
adventure 1
iv 1
the 1
boscombe 1
valley 1
mystery 1
we 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
breakfast 1
one 1
morning 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
i 1
when 1
the 1
maid 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
telegram 1

was 1
from 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
and 1
ran 1
in 1

way 1

been 1
looking 1
a 1
little 1
pale 1
lately 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
change 1
would 1
do 1
you 1
good 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
so 1
interested 1
in 1
mr 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
cases 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
ungrateful 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
not 1
seeing 1
what 1
i 1
gained 1
through 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
i 1
answered 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
go 1
i 1
must 1
pack 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
my 1
experience 1
of 1
camp 1
life 1
in 1
afghanistan 1
had 1
at 1
least 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
making 1
me 1
a 1
prompt 1
and 1
ready 1
traveller 1
my 1
wants 1
were 1
few 1
and 1
simple 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
time 1
stated 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
with 1
my 1
valise 1
rattling 1
away 1
to 1
paddington 1
station 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
was 1
pacing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
platform 1
his 1
tall 1
gaunt 1
figure 1
made 1
even 1
gaunter 1
and 1
taller 1
by 1
his 1
long 1
grey 1
travellingcloak 1
and 1
closefitting 1
cloth 1
cap 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
very 1
good 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
watson 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
makes 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
to 1
me 1
having 1
someone 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
thoroughly 1
rely 1
local 1
aid 1
is 1
always 1
either 1
worthless 1
or 1
else 1
biassed 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
keep 1
the 1
two 1
corner 1
seats 1
i 1
shall 1
get 1
the 1
tickets 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
carriage 1
to 1
ourselves 1
save 1
for 1
an 1
immense 1
litter 1
of 1
papers 1
which 1
holmes 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
among 1
these 1
he 1
rummaged 1
and 1
read 1
with 1
intervals 1
of 1
notetaking 1
and 1
of 1
meditation 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
past 1
reading 1
then 1
he 1
suddenly 1
rolled 1
them 1
all 1
into 1
a 1
gigantic 1
ball 1
and 1
tossed 1
them 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
rack 1
have 1
you 1
heard 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
he 1
asked 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
a 1
paper 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
the 1
london 1
press 1
has 1
not 1
had 1
very 1
full 1
accounts 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
looking 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
recent 1
papers 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
master 1
the 1
particulars 1
it 1
seems 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
gather 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
simple 1
cases 1
which 1
are 1
so 1
extremely 1
difficult 1
that 1
sounds 1
a 1
little 1
paradoxical 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
profoundly 1
true 1
singularity 1
is 1
almost 1
invariably 1
a 1
clue 1
the 1
more 1
featureless 1
and 1
commonplace 1
a 1
crime 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
difficult 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
home 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
however 1
they 1
have 1
established 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
case 1
against 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
murder 1
then 1
well 1
it 1
is 1
conjectured 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
i 1
shall 1
take 1
nothing 1
for 1
granted 1
until 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
looking 1
personally 1
into 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
explain 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
words 1
boscombe 1
valley 1
is 1
a 1
country 1
district 1
not 1
very 1
far 1
from 1
ross 1
in 1
herefordshire 1
the 1
largest 1
landed 1
proprietor 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
is 1
a 1
mr 1
john 1
turner 1
who 1
made 1
his 1
money 1
in 1
australia 1
and 1
returned 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
country 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
farms 1
which 1
he 1
held 1
that 1
of 1
hatherley 1
was 1
let 1
to 1
mr 1
charles 1
mccarthy 1
who 1
was 1
also 1
an 1
exaustralian 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
colonies 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
unnatural 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
they 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
as 1
near 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
possible 1
turner 1
was 1
apparently 1
the 1
richer 1
man 1
so 1
mccarthy 1
became 1
his 1
tenant 1
but 1
still 1
remained 1
it 1
seems 1
upon 1
terms 1
of 1
perfect 1
equality 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
frequently 1
together 1
mccarthy 1
had 1
one 1
son 1
a 1
lad 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
turner 1
had 1
an 1
only 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
age 1
but 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
wives 1
living 1
they 1
appear 1
to 1
have 1
avoided 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
english 1
families 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
led 1
retired 1
lives 1
though 1
both 1
the 1
mccarthys 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
sport 1
and 1
were 1
frequently 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
racemeetings 1
of 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
mccarthy 1
kept 1
two 1
servantsa 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
girl 1
turner 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
household 1
some 1
halfdozen 1
at 1
the 1
least 1
that 1
is 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
gather 1
about 1
the 1
families 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
facts 1
on 1
june 1
3rd 1
that 1
is 1
on 1
monday 1
last 1
mccarthy 1
left 1
his 1
house 1
at 1
hatherley 1
about 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
walked 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
lake 1
formed 1
by 1
the 1
spreading 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
the 1
boscombe 1
valley 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
with 1
his 1
servingman 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
at 1
ross 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
man 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
hurry 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
appointment 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
keep 1
at 1
three 1
from 1
that 1
appointment 1
he 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
alive 1
from 1
hatherley 1
farmhouse 1
to 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
is 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
two 1
people 1
saw 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
over 1
this 1
ground 1
one 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
whose 1
name 1
is 1
not 1
mentioned 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
william 1
crowder 1
a 1
gamekeeper 1
in 1
the 1
employ 1
of 1
mr 1
turner 1
both 1
these 1
witnesses 1
depose 1
that 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
was 1
walking 1
alone 1
the 1
gamekeeper 1
adds 1
that 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
of 1
his 1
seeing 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
pass 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
son 1
mr 1
james 1
mccarthy 1
going 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
belief 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
actually 1
in 1
sight 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
following 1
him 1
he 1
thought 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
that 1
had 1
occurred 1
the 1
two 1
mccarthys 1
were 1
seen 1
after 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
william 1
crowder 1
the 1
gamekeeper 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
is 1
thickly 1
wooded 1
round 1
with 1
just 1
a 1
fringe 1
of 1
grass 1
and 1
of 1
reeds 1
round 1
the 1
edge 1
a 1
girl 1
of 1
fourteen 1
patience 1
moran 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
lodgekeeper 1
of 1
the 1
boscombe 1
valley 1
estate 1
was 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
picking 1
flowers 1
she 1
states 1
that 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
at 1
the 1
border 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
and 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
having 1
a 1
violent 1
quarrel 1
she 1
heard 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
the 1
elder 1
using 1
very 1
strong 1
language 1
to 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
latter 1
raise 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
strike 1
his 1
father 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
by 1
their 1
violence 1
that 1
she 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
home 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
two 1
mccarthys 1
quarrelling 1
near 1
boscombe 1
pool 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
fight 1
she 1
had 1
hardly 1
said 1
the 1
words 1
when 1
young 1
mr 1
mccarthy 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
lodge 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
his 1
father 1
dead 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
lodgekeeper 1
he 1
was 1
much 1
excited 1
without 1
either 1
his 1
gun 1
or 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
sleeve 1
were 1
observed 1
to 1
be 1
stained 1
with 1
fresh 1
blood 1
on 1
following 1
him 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
stretched 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
beside 1
the 1
pool 1
the 1
head 1
had 1
been 1
beaten 1
in 1
by 1
repeated 1
blows 1
of 1
some 1
heavy 1
and 1
blunt 1
weapon 1
the 1
injuries 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
might 1
very 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
inflicted 1
by 1
the 1
buttend 1
of 1
his 1
sons 1
gun 1
which 1
was 1
found 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
under 1
these 1
circumstances 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
instantly 1
arrested 1
and 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
wilful 1
murder 1
having 1
been 1
returned 1
at 1
the 1
inquest 1
on 1
tuesday 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
wednesday 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
magistrates 1
at 1
ross 1
who 1
have 1
referred 1
the 1
case 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
assizes 1
those 1
are 1
the 1
main 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
out 1
before 1
the 1
coroner 1
and 1
the 1
policecourt 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
a 1
more 1
damning 1
case 1
i 1
remarked 1
if 1
ever 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
pointed 1
to 1
a 1
criminal 1
it 1
does 1
so 1
here 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
tricky 1
thing 1
answered 1
holmes 1
thoughtfully 1
it 1
may 1
seem 1
to 1
point 1
very 1
straight 1
to 1
one 1
thing 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
shift 1
your 1
own 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
a 1
little 1
you 1
may 1
find 1
it 1
pointing 1
in 1
an 1
equally 1
uncompromising 1
manner 1
to 1
something 1
entirely 1
different 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
confessed 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
case 1
looks 1
exceedingly 1
grave 1
against 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
possible 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
culprit 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
however 1
and 1
among 1
them 1
miss 1
turner 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
landowner 1
who 1
believe 1
in 1
his 1
innocence 1
and 1
who 1
have 1
retained 1
lestrade 1
whom 1
you 1
may 1
recollect 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
study 1
in 1
scarlet 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
his 1
interest 1
lestrade 1
being 1
rather 1
puzzled 1
has 1
referred 1
the 1
case 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
hence 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
two 1
middleaged 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
flying 1
westward 1
at 1
fifty 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
instead 1
of 1
quietly 1
digesting 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
said 1
i 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
so 1
obvious 1
that 1
you 1
