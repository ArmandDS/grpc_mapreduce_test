to 1
mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
you 1
will 1
rejoice 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
no 1
disaster 1
has 1
accompanied 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
an 1
enterprise 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
regarded 1
with 1
such 1
evil 1
forebodings 1
i 1
arrived 1
here 1
yesterday 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
task 1
is 1
to 1
assure 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
of 1
my 1
welfare 1
and 1
increasing 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
i 1
am 1
already 1
far 1
north 1
of 1
london 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
petersburgh 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
cold 1
northern 1
breeze 1
play 1
upon 1
my 1
cheeks 1
which 1
braces 1
my 1
nerves 1
and 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
delight 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
this 1
feeling 1
this 1
breeze 1
which 1
has 1
travelled 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
towards 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
advancing 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
foretaste 1
of 1
those 1
icy 1
climes 1
inspirited 1
by 1
this 1
wind 1
of 1
promise 1
my 1
daydreams 1
become 1
more 1
fervent 1
and 1
vivid 1
i 1
try 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
that 1
the 1
pole 1
is 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
frost 1
and 1
desolation 1
it 1
ever 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
as 1
the 1
region 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
delight 1
there 1
margaret 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
forever 1
visible 1
its 1
broad 1
disk 1
just 1
skirting 1
the 1
horizon 1
and 1
diffusing 1
a 1
perpetual 1
splendour 1
therefor 1
with 1
your 1
leave 1
my 1
sister 1
i 1
will 1
put 1
some 1
trust 1
in 1
preceding 1
navigatorsthere 1
snow 1
and 1
frost 1
are 1
banished 1
and 1
sailing 1
over 1
a 1
calm 1
sea 1
we 1
may 1
be 1
wafted 1
to 1
a 1
land 1
surpassing 1
in 1
wonders 1
and 1
in 1
beauty 1
every 1
region 1
hitherto 1
discovered 1
on 1
the 1
habitable 1
globe 1
its 1
productions 1
and 1
features 1
may 1
be 1
without 1
example 1
as 1
the 1
phenomena 1
of 1
the 1
heavenly 1
bodies 1
undoubtedly 1
are 1
in 1
those 1
undiscovered 1
solitudes 1
what 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
of 1
eternal 1
light 1
i 1
may 1
there 1
discover 1
the 1
wondrous 1
power 1
which 1
attracts 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
may 1
regulate 1
a 1
thousand 1
celestial 1
observations 1
that 1
require 1
only 1
this 1
voyage 1
to 1
render 1
their 1
seeming 1
eccentricities 1
consistent 1
forever 1
i 1
shall 1
satiate 1
my 1
ardent 1
curiosity 1
with 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
never 1
before 1
visited 1
and 1
may 1
tread 1
a 1
land 1
never 1
before 1
imprinted 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
man 1
these 1
are 1
my 1
enticements 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
sufficient 1
to 1
conquer 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
death 1
and 1
to 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
laborious 1
voyage 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
a 1
child 1
feels 1
when 1
he 1
embarks 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
with 1
his 1
holiday 1
mates 1
on 1
an 1
expedition 1
of 1
discovery 1
up 1
his 1
native 1
river 1
but 1
supposing 1
all 1
these 1
conjectures 1
to 1
be 1
false 1
you 1
cannot 1
contest 1
the 1
inestimable 1
benefit 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
confer 1
on 1
all 1
mankind 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
generation 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
passage 1
near 1
the 1
pole 1
to 1
those 1
countries 1
to 1
reach 1
which 1
at 1
present 1
so 1
many 1
months 1
are 1
requisite 1
or 1
by 1
ascertaining 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
magnet 1
which 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
possible 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
effected 1
by 1
an 1
undertaking 1
such 1
as 1
mine 1
these 1
reflections 1
have 1
dispelled 1
the 1
agitation 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
began 1
my 1
letter 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
my 1
heart 1
glow 1
with 1
an 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
elevates 1
me 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
nothing 1
contributes 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
tranquillize 1
the 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
steady 1
purposea 1
point 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
soul 1
may 1
fix 1
its 1
intellectual 1
eye 1
this 1
expedition 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
dream 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
i 1
have 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
voyages 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
arriving 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
pacific 1
ocean 1
through 1
the 1
seas 1
which 1
surround 1
the 1
pole 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
that 1
a 1
history 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
voyages 1
made 1
for 1
purposes 1
of 1
discovery 1
composed 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
our 1
good 1
uncle 1
thomas 1
library 1
my 1
education 1
was 1
neglected 1
yet 1
i 1
was 1
passionately 1
fond 1
of 1
reading 1
these 1
volumes 1
were 1
my 1
study 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
and 1
my 1
familiarity 1
with 1
them 1
increased 1
that 1
regret 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
felt 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
on 1
learning 1
that 1
my 1
fathers 1
dying 1
injunction 1
had 1
forbidden 1
my 1
uncle 1
to 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
embark 1
in 1
a 1
seafaring 1
life 1
these 1
visions 1
faded 1
when 1
i 1
perused 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
those 1
poets 1
whose 1
effusions 1
entranced 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
to 1
heaven 1
i 1
also 1
became 1
a 1
poet 1
and 1
for 1
one 1
year 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
paradise 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
creation 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
i 1
also 1
might 1
obtain 1
a 1
niche 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
where 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
homer 1
and 1
shakespeare 1
are 1
consecrated 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
failure 1
and 1
how 1
heavily 1
i 1
bore 1
the 1
disappointment 1
but 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
inherited 1
the 1
fortune 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
and 1
my 1
thoughts 1
were 1
turned 1
into 1
the 1
channel 1
of 1
their 1
earlier 1
bent 1
six 1
years 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
i 1
resolved 1
on 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
i 1
can 1
even 1
now 1
remember 1
the 1
hour 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
to 1
this 1
great 1
enterprise 1
i 1
commenced 1
by 1
inuring 1
my 1
body 1
to 1
hardship 1
i 1
accompanied 1
the 1
whalefishers 1
on 1
several 1
expeditions 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
sea 1
i 1
voluntarily 1
endured 1
cold 1
famine 1
thirst 1
and 1
want 1
of 1
sleep 1
i 1
often 1
worked 1
harder 1
than 1
the 1
common 1
sailors 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
devoted 1
my 1
nights 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
mathematics 1
the 1
theory 1
of 1
medicine 1
and 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
physical 1
science 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
naval 1
adventurer 1
might 1
derive 1
the 1
greatest 1
practical 1
advantage 1
twice 1
i 1
actually 1
hired 1
myself 1
as 1
an 1
undermate 1
in 1
a 1
greenland 1
whaler 1
and 1
acquitted 1
myself 1
to 1
admiration 1
i 1
must 1
own 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
proud 1
when 1
my 1
captain 1
offered 1
me 1
the 1
second 1
dignity 1
in 1
the 1
vessel 1
and 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
earnestness 1
so 1
valuable 1
did 1
he 1
consider 1
my 1
services 1
and 1
now 1
dear 1
margaret 1
do 1
i 1
not 1
deserve 1
to 1
accomplish 1
some 1
great 1
purpose 1
my 1
life 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
passed 1
in 1
ease 1
and 1
luxury 1
but 1
i 1
preferred 1
glory 1
to 1
every 1
enticement 1
that 1
wealth 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
path 1
oh 1
that 1
some 1
encouraging 1
voice 1
would 1
answer 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
my 1
resolution 1
is 1
firm 1
but 1
my 1
hopes 1
fluctuate 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
are 1
often 1
depressed 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
proceed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
difficult 1
voyage 1
the 1
emergencies 1
of 1
which 1
will 1
demand 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
i 1
am 1
required 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
others 1
but 1
sometimes 1
to 1
sustain 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
theirs 1
are 1
failing 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
favourable 1
period 1
for 1
travelling 1
in 1
russia 1
they 1
fly 1
quickly 1
over 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
their 1
sledges 1
the 1
motion 1
is 1
pleasant 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
far 1
more 1
agreeable 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
english 1
stagecoach 1
the 1
cold 1
is 1
not 1
excessive 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
wrapped 1
in 1
fursa 1
dress 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
adopted 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
between 1
walking 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
remaining 1
seated 1
motionless 1
for 1
hours 1
when 1
no 1
exercise 1
prevents 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
actually 1
freezing 1
in 1
your 1
veins 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
ambition 1
to 1
lose 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
the 1
postroad 1
between 1
st 1
petersburgh 1
and 1
archangel 1
i 1
shall 1
depart 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
town 1
in 1
a 1
fortnight 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
my 1
intention 1
is 1
to 1
hire 1
a 1
ship 1
there 1
which 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
done 1
by 1
paying 1
the 1
insurance 1
for 1
the 1
owner 1
and 1
to 1
engage 1
as 1
many 1
sailors 1
as 1
i 1
think 1
necessary 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
whalefishing 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
sail 1
until 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
june 1
and 1
when 1
shall 1
i 1
return 1
ah 1
dear 1
sister 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
answer 1
this 1
question 1
if 1
i 1
succeed 1
many 1
many 1
months 1
perhaps 1
years 1
will 1
pass 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
meet 1
if 1
i 1
fail 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
again 1
soon 1
or 1
never 1
farewell 1
my 1
dear 1
excellent 1
margaret 1
heaven 1
shower 1
down 1
blessings 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
save 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
testify 1
my 1
gratitude 1
for 1
all 1
your 1
love 1
and 1
kindness 1

28th 1

17 1
to 1
mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
how 1
slowly 1
the 1
time 1
passes 1
here 1
encompassed 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
frost 1
and 1
snow 1
yet 1
a 1
second 1
step 1
is 1
taken 1
towards 1
my 1
enterprise 1
i 1
have 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
and 1
am 1
occupied 1
in 1
collecting 1
my 1
sailors 1
those 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
engaged 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
men 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
depend 1
and 1
are 1
certainly 1
possessed 1
of 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
want 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
yet 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
satisfy 1
and 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
as 1
a 1
most 1
severe 1
evil 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
friend 1
margaret 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
glowing 1
with 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
none 1
to 1
participate 1
my 1
joy 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
assailed 1
by 1
disappointment 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
sustain 1
me 1
in 1
dejection 1
i 1
shall 1
commit 1
my 1
thoughts 1
to 1
paper 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
poor 1
medium 1
for 1
the 1
communication 1
of 1
feeling 1
i 1
desire 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
sympathize 1
with 1
me 1
whose 1
eyes 1
would 1
reply 1
to 1
mine 1
you 1
may 1
deem 1
me 1
romantic 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
but 1
i 1
bitterly 1
feel 1
the 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
one 1
near 1
me 1
gentle 1
yet 1
courageous 1
possessed 1
of 1
a 1
cultivated 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
capacious 1
mind 1
whose 1
tastes 1
are 1
like 1
my 1
own 1
to 1
approve 1
or 1
amend 1
my 1
plans 1
how 1
would 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
repair 1
the 1
faults 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
brother 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
ardent 1
in 1
execution 1
and 1
too 1
impatient 1
of 1
difficulties 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
still 1
greater 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
selfeducated 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
fourteen 1
years 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
ran 1
wild 1
on 1
a 1
common 1
and 1
read 1
nothing 1
but 1
our 1
uncle 1
thomas 1
books 1
of 1
voyages 1
at 1
that 1
age 1
i 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
celebrated 1
poets 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
derive 1
its 1
most 1
important 1
benefits 1
from 1
such 1
a 1
conviction 1
that 1
i 1
perceived 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
more 1
languages 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
twentyeight 1
and 1
am 1
in 1
reality 1
more 1
illiterate 1
than 1
many 1
schoolboys 1
of 1
fifteen 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
more 1
and 1
that 1
my 1
daydreams 1
are 1
more 1
extended 1
and 1
magnificent 1
but 1
they 1
want 1
as 1
the 1
painters 1
call 1
it 1
keeping 1
and 1
i 1
greatly 1
need 1
a 1
friend 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
sense 1
enough 1
not 1
to 1
despise 1
me 1
as 1
romantic 1
and 1
affection 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
endeavour 1
to 1
regulate 1
my 1
mind 1
well 1
these 1
are 1
useless 1
complaints 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
nor 1
even 1
here 1
in 1
archangel 1
among 1
merchants 1
and 1
seamen 1
yet 1
some 1
feelings 1
unallied 1
to 1
the 1
dross 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
beat 1
even 1
in 1
these 1
rugged 1
bosoms 1
my 1
lieutenant 1
for 1
instance 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
wonderful 1
courage 1
and 1
enterprise 1
he 1
is 1
madly 1
desirous 1
of 1
glory 1
or 1
rather 1
to 1
word 1
my 1
phrase 1
more 1
characteristically 1
of 1
advancement 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
englishman 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
national 1
and 1
professional 1
prejudices 1
unsoftened 1
by 1
cultivation 1
retains 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
noblest 1
endowments 1
of 1
humanity 1
i 1
first 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
him 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
whale 1
vessel 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
unemployed 1
in 1
this 1
city 1
i 1
easily 1
engaged 1
him 1
to 1
assist 1
in 1
my 1
enterprise 1
the 1
master 1
is 1
a 1
person 1
of 1
an 1
excellent 1
disposition 1
and 1
is 1
remarkable 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
for 1
his 1
gentleness 1
and 1
the 1
mildness 1
of 1
his 1
discipline 1
this 1
circumstance 1
added 1
to 1
his 1
wellknown 1
integrity 1
and 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
made 1
me 1
very 1
desirous 1
to 1
engage 1
him 1
a 1
youth 1
passed 1
in 1
solitude 1
my 1
best 1
years 1
spent 1
under 1
your 1
gentle 1
and 1
feminine 1
fosterage 1
has 1
so 1
refined 1
the 1
groundwork 1
of 1
my 1
character 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
overcome 1
an 1
intense 1
distaste 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
brutality 1
exercised 1
on 1
board 1
ship 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
believed 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
necessary 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
a 1
mariner 1
equally 1
noted 1
for 1
his 1
kindliness 1
of 1
heart 1
and 1
the 1
respect 1
and 1
obedience 1
paid 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
his 1
crew 1
i 1
felt 1
myself 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
in 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
secure 1
his 1
services 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
first 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
romantic 1
manner 1
from 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
owes 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
this 1
briefly 1
is 1
his 1
story 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
he 1
loved 1
a 1
young 1
russian 1
lady 1
of 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
and 1
having 1
amassed 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
in 1
prizemoney 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
consented 1
to 1
the 1
match 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
mistress 1
once 1
before 1
the 1
destined 1
ceremony 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
bathed 1
in 1
tears 1
and 1
throwing 1
herself 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
confessing 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
another 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
would 1
never 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
union 1
my 1
generous 1
friend 1
reassured 1
the 1
suppliant 1
and 1
on 1
being 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
instantly 1
abandoned 1
his 1
pursuit 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
bought 1
a 1
farm 1
with 1
his 1
money 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
designed 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
bestowed 1
the 1
whole 1
on 1
his 1
rival 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
his 1
prizemoney 1
to 1
purchase 1
stock 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
solicited 1
the 1
young 1
womans 1
father 1
to 1
consent 1
to 1
her 1
marriage 1
with 1
her 1
lover 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
decidedly 1
refused 1
thinking 1
himself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
father 1
inexorable 1
quitted 1
his 1
country 1
nor 1
returned 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
his 1
former 1
mistress 1
was 1
married 1
according 1
to 1
her 1
inclinations 1
what 1
a 1
noble 1
fellow 1
you 1
will 1
exclaim 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
wholly 1
uneducated 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
a 1
turk 1
and 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
ignorant 1
carelessness 1
attends 1
him 1
which 1
while 1
it 1
renders 1
his 1
conduct 1
the 1
more 1
astonishing 1
detracts 1
from 1
the 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
which 1
otherwise 1
he 1
would 1
command 1
yet 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
because 1
i 1
complain 1
a 1
little 1
or 1
because 1
i 1
can 1
conceive 1
a 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
toils 1
which 1
i 1
may 1
never 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
wavering 1
in 1
my 1
resolutions 1
those 1
are 1
as 1
fixed 1
as 1
fate 1
and 1
my 1
voyage 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
delayed 1
until 1
the 1
weather 1
shall 1
permit 1
my 1
embarkation 1
the 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
dreadfully 1
severe 1
but 1
the 1
spring 1
promises 1
well 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
remarkably 1
early 1
season 1
so 1
that 1
perhaps 1
i 1
may 1
sail 1
sooner 1
than 1
i 1
expected 1
i 1
shall 1
do 1
nothing 1
rashly 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
my 1
prudence 1
and 1
considerateness 1
whenever 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
others 1
is 1
committed 1
to 1
my 1
care 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
the 1
near 1
prospect 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
communicate 1
to 1
you 1
a 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
trembling 1
sensation 1
half 1
pleasurable 1
and 1
half 1
fearful 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
preparing 1
to 1
depart 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
unexplored 1
regions 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
mist 1
and 1
snow 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
kill 1
no 1
albatross 1
therefore 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
alarmed 1
for 1
my 1
safety 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
worn 1
and 1
woeful 1
as 1
the 1
ancient 1
mariner 1
you 1
will 1
smile 1
at 1
my 1
allusion 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
attributed 1
my 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
passionate 1
enthusiasm 1
for 1
the 1
dangerous 1
mysteries 1
of 1
ocean 1
to 1
that 1
production 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
imaginative 1
of 1
modern 1
poets 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
my 1
soul 1
which 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
i 1
am 1
practically 1
industriouspainstaking 1
a 1
workman 1
to 1
execute 1
with 1
perseverance 1
and 1
labourbut 1
besides 1
this 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
marvellous 1
a 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
marvellous 1
intertwined 1
in 1
all 1
my 1
projects 1
which 1
hurries 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
pathways 1
of 1
men 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
wild 1
sea 1
and 1
unvisited 1
regions 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
explore 1
but 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
dearer 1
considerations 1
shall 1
i 1
meet 1
you 1
again 1
after 1
having 1
traversed 1
immense 1
seas 1
and 1
returned 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
southern 1
cape 1
of 1
africa 1
or 1
america 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
expect 1
such 1
success 1
yet 1
i 1
cannot 1
bear 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
the 1
reverse 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
continue 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
every 1
opportunity 1
i 1
may 1
receive 1
your 1
letters 1
on 1
some 1
occasions 1
when 1
i 1
need 1
them 1
most 1
to 1
support 1
my 1
spirits 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
very 1
tenderly 1
remember 1

mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
i 1
write 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
in 1
haste 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
safeand 1
well 1
advanced 1
on 1
my 1
voyage 1
this 1
letter 1
will 1
reach 1
england 1
by 1
a 1
merchantman 1
now 1
on 1
its 1
homeward 1
voyage 1
from 1
archangel 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
i 1
who 1
may 1
not 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
land 1
perhaps 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
i 1
am 1
however 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
my 1
men 1
are 1
bold 1
and 1
apparently 1
firm 1
of 1
purpose 1
nor 1
do 1
the 1
floating 1
sheets 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
continually 1
pass 1
us 1
indicating 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
region 1
towards 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
advancing 1
appear 1
to 1
dismay 1
them 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
reached 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
latitude 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
although 1
not 1
so 1
warm 1
as 1
in 1
england 1
the 1
southern 1
gales 1
which 1
blow 1
us 1
speedily 1
towards 1
those 1
shores 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
to 1
attain 1
breathe 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
renovating 1
warmth 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
expected 1
no 1
incidents 1
have 1
hitherto 1
befallen 1
us 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
figure 1
in 1
a 1
letter 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
stiff 1
gales 1
and 1
the 1
springing 1
of 1
a 1
leak 1
are 1
accidents 1
which 1
experienced 1
navigators 1
scarcely 1
remember 1
to 1
record 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
well 1
content 1
if 1
nothing 1
worse 1
happen 1
to 1
us 1
during 1
our 1
voyage 1
adieu 1
my 1
dear 1
margaret 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
sake 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
yours 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
rashly 1
encounter 1
danger 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
cool 1
persevering 1
and 1
prudent 1
but 1
success 1
shall 1
crown 1
my 1
endeavours 1
wherefore 1
not 1
thus 1
far 1
i 1
have 1
gone 1
tracing 1
a 1
secure 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
pathless 1
seas 1
the 1
very 1
stars 1
themselves 1
being 1
witnesses 1
and 1
testimonies 1
of 1
my 1
triumph 1
why 1
not 1
still 1
proceed 1
over 1
the 1
untamed 1
yet 1
obedient 1
element 1
what 1
can 1
stop 1
the 1
determined 1
heart 1
and 1
resolved 1
will 1
of 1
man 1
my 1
swelling 1
heart 1
involuntarily 1
pours 1
itself 1

letter 1
4 1
august 1
5th 1
17 1
to 1
mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
so 1
strange 1
an 1
accident 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
before 1
these 1
papers 1
can 1
come 1
into 1
your 1
possession 1
last 1
monday 1
july 1
31st 1
we 1
were 1
nearly 1
surrounded 1
by 1
ice 1
which 1
closed 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
scarcely 1
leaving 1
her 1
the 1
searoom 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
floated 1
our 1
situation 1
was 1
somewhat 1
dangerous 1
especially 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
compassed 1
round 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
thick 1
fog 1
we 1
accordingly 1
lay 1
to 1
hoping 1
that 1
some 1
change 1
would 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
weather 1
about 1
two 1
oclock 1
the 1
mist 1
cleared 1
away 1
and 1
we 1
beheld 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
vast 1
and 1
irregular 1
plains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
end 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
comrades 1
groaned 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
watchful 1
with 1
anxious 1
thoughts 1
when 1
a 1
strange 1
sight 1
suddenly 1
attracted 1
our 1
attention 1
and 1
diverted 1
our 1
solicitude 1
from 1
our 1
own 1
situation 1
we 1
perceived 1
a 1
low 1
carriage 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
drawn 1
by 1
dogs 1
pass 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
a 1
being 1
which 1
had 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
apparently 1
of 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
sledge 1
and 1
guided 1
the 1
dogs 1
we 1
watched 1
the 1
rapid 1
progress 1
of 1
the 1
traveller 1
with 1
our 1
telescopes 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
distant 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
this 1
appearance 1
excited 1
our 1
unqualified 1
wonder 1
we 1
were 1
as 1
we 1
believed 1
many 1
hundred 1
miles 1
from 1
any 1
land 1
but 1
this 1
apparition 1
seemed 1
to 1
denote 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
reality 1
so 1
distant 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
supposed 1
shut 1
in 1
however 1
by 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
track 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
observed 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
about 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1
this 1
occurrence 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
and 1
before 1
night 1
the 1
ice 1
broke 1
and 1
freed 1
our 1
ship 1
we 1
however 1
lay 1
to 1
until 1
the 1
morning 1
fearing 1
to 1
encounter 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
those 1
large 1
loose 1
masses 1
which 1
float 1
about 1
after 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
i 1
profited 1
of 1
this 1
time 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
however 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
i 1
went 1
upon 1
deck 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
the 1
sailors 1
busy 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
vessel 1
apparently 1
talking 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
fact 1
a 1
sledge 1
like 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
before 1
which 1
had 1
drifted 1
towards 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
fragment 1
of 1
ice 1
only 1
one 1
dog 1
remained 1
alive 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
within 1
it 1
whom 1
the 1
sailors 1
were 1
persuading 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
vessel 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
traveller 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
savage 1
inhabitant 1
of 1
some 1
undiscovered 1
island 1
but 1
a 1
european 1
when 1
i 1
appeared 1
on 1
deck 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
here 1
is 1
our 1
captain 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
on 1
perceiving 1
me 1
the 1
stranger 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
english 1
although 1
with 1
a 1
foreign 1
accent 1
before 1
i 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
your 1
vessel 1
said 1
he 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
inform 1
me 1
whither 1
you 1
are 1
bound 1
you 1
may 1
conceive 1
my 1
astonishment 1
on 1
hearing 1
such 1
a 1
question 1
addressed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
destruction 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
supposed 1
that 1
my 1
vessel 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
resource 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exchanged 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
wealth 1
the 1
earth 1
can 1
afford 1
i 1
replied 1
however 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
towards 1
the 1
northern 1
pole 1
upon 1
hearing 1
this 1
he 1
appeared 1
satisfied 1
and 1
consented 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
good 1
god 1
margaret 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
thus 1
capitulated 1
for 1
his 1
safety 1
your 1
surprise 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
boundless 1
his 1
limbs 1
were 1
nearly 1
frozen 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
dreadfully 1
emaciated 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
suffering 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
so 1
wretched 1
a 1
condition 1
we 1
attempted 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
quitted 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
he 1
fainted 1
we 1
accordingly 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
restored 1
him 1
to 1
animation 1
by 1
rubbing 1
him 1
with 1
brandy 1
and 1
forcing 1
him 1
to 1
swallow 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
showed 1
signs 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
wrapped 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
blankets 1
and 1
placed 1
him 1
near 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
stove 1
by 1
slow 1
degrees 1
he 1
recovered 1
and 1
ate 1
a 1
little 1
soup 1
which 1
restored 1
him 1
wonderfully 1
two 1
days 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
feared 1
that 1
his 1
sufferings 1
had 1
deprived 1
him 1
of 1
understanding 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
some 1
measure 1
recovered 1
i 1
removed 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
cabin 1
and 1
attended 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
my 1
duty 1
would 1
permit 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
more 1
interesting 1
creature 1
his 1
eyes 1
have 1
generally 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
wildness 1
and 1
even 1
madness 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
if 1
anyone 1
performs 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
kindness 1
towards 1
him 1
or 1
does 1
him 1
any 1
the 1
most 1
trifling 1
service 1
his 1
whole 1
countenance 1
is 1
lighted 1
up 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
with 1
a 1
beam 1
of 1
benevolence 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
equalled 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
generally 1
melancholy 1
and 1
despairing 1
and 1
sometimes 1
he 1
gnashes 1
his 1
teeth 1
as 1
if 1
impatient 1
of 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
woes 1
that 1
oppresses 1
him 1
when 1
my 1
guest 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
recovered 1
i 1
had 1
great 1
trouble 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
a 1
thousand 1
questions 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
tormented 1
by 1
their 1
idle 1
curiosity 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
mind 1
whose 1
restoration 1
evidently 1
depended 1
upon 1
entire 1
repose 1
once 1
however 1
the 1
lieutenant 1
asked 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
so 1
far 1
upon 1
the 1
ice 1
in 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
vehicle 1
his 1
countenance 1
instantly 1
assumed 1
an 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
deepest 1
gloom 1
and 1
he 1
replied 1
to 1
seek 1
one 1
who 1
fled 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
did 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
you 1
pursued 1
travel 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
fashion 1
yes 1
then 1
i 1
fancy 1
we 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
we 1
picked 1
you 1
up 1
we 1
saw 1
some 1
dogs 1
drawing 1
a 1
sledge 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
this 1
aroused 1
the 1
strangers 1
attention 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
questions 1
concerning 1
the 1
route 1
which 1
the 1
demon 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
him 1
had 1
pursued 1
soon 1
after 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
doubtless 1
excited 1
your 1
curiosity 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
considerate 1
to 1
make 1
inquiries 1
certainly 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
very 1
impertinent 1
and 1
inhuman 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
trouble 1
you 1
with 1
any 1
inquisitiveness 1
of 1
mine 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
rescued 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
perilous 1
situation 1
you 1
have 1
benevolently 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
he 1
inquired 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
destroyed 1
the 1
other 1
sledge 1
i 1
replied 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
with 1
any 1
degree 1
of 1
certainty 1
for 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
not 1
broken 1
until 1
near 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
traveller 1
might 1
have 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
before 1
that 1
time 1
but 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
judge 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
new 1
spirit 1
of 1
life 1
animated 1
the 1
decaying 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
he 1
manifested 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
be 1
upon 1
deck 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
appeared 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
weak 1
to 1
sustain 1
the 1
rawness 1
of 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
that 1
someone 1
should 1
watch 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
instant 1
notice 1
if 1
any 1
new 1
object 1
should 1
appear 1
in 1
sight 1
such 1
is 1
my 1
journal 1
of 1
what 1
relates 1
to 1
this 1
strange 1
occurrence 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
the 1
stranger 1
has 1
gradually 1
improved 1
in 1
health 1
but 1
is 1
very 1
silent 1
and 1
appears 1
uneasy 1
when 1
anyone 1
except 1
myself 1
enters 1
his 1
cabin 1
yet 1
his 1
manners 1
are 1
so 1
conciliating 1
and 1
gentle 1
that 1
the 1
sailors 1
are 1
all 1
interested 1
in 1
him 1
although 1
they 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
communication 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
brother 1
and 1
his 1
constant 1
and 1
deep 1
grief 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
noble 1
creature 1
in 1
his 1
better 1
days 1
being 1
even 1
now 1
in 1
wreck 1
so 1
attractive 1
and 1
amiable 1
i 1
said 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
letters 1
my 1
dear 1
margaret 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
yet 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
before 1
his 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
by 1
misery 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
as 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
shall 1
continue 1
my 1
journal 1
concerning 1
the 1
stranger 1
at 1
intervals 1
should 1
i 1
have 1
any 1
fresh 1
incidents 1
to 1
record 1
august 1
13th 1
17 1
my 1
affection 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
increases 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
excites 1
at 1
once 1
my 1
admiration 1
and 1
my 1
pity 1
to 1
an 1
astonishing 1
degree 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
see 1
so 1
noble 1
a 1
creature 1
destroyed 1
by 1
misery 1
without 1
feeling 1
the 1
most 1
poignant 1
grief 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
wise 1
his 1
mind 1
is 1
so 1
cultivated 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
although 1
his 1
words 1
are 1
culled 1
with 1
the 1
choicest 1
art 1
yet 1
they 1
flow 1
with 1
rapidity 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
eloquence 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
much 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
illness 1
and 1
is 1
continually 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
apparently 1
watching 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
that 1
preceded 1
his 1
own 1
yet 1
although 1
unhappy 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
utterly 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
misery 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
interests 1
himself 1
deeply 1
in 1
the 1
projects 1
of 1
others 1
he 1
has 1
frequently 1
conversed 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
mine 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
communicated 1
to 1
him 1
without 1
disguise 1
he 1
entered 1
attentively 1
into 1
all 1
my 1
arguments 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
my 1
eventual 1
success 1
and 1
into 1
every 1
minute 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
measures 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
easily 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
sympathy 1
which 1
he 1
evinced 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
give 1
utterance 1
to 1
the 1
burning 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
to 1
say 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
fervour 1
that 1
warmed 1
me 1
how 1
gladly 1
i 1
would 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
fortune 1
my 1
existence 1
my 1
every 1
hope 1
to 1
the 1
furtherance 1
of 1
my 1
enterprise 1
one 1
mans 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
were 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
price 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
the 1
knowledge 1
which 1
i 1
sought 1
for 1
the 1
dominion 1
i 1
should 1
acquire 1
and 1
transmit 1
over 1
the 1
elemental 1
foes 1
of 1
our 1
race 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
a 1
dark 1
gloom 1
spread 1
over 1
my 1
listeners 1
countenance 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
suppress 1
his 1
emotion 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
voice 1
quivered 1
and 1
failed 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
beheld 1
tears 1
trickle 1
fast 1
from 1
between 1
his 1
fingers 1
a 1
groan 1
burst 1
from 1
his 1
heaving 1
breast 1
i 1
paused 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
unhappy 1
man 1
do 1
you 1
share 1
my 1
madness 1
have 1
you 1
drunk 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
intoxicating 1
draught 1
hear 1
me 1
let 1
me 1
reveal 1
my 1
tale 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
dash 1
the 1
cup 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
such 1
words 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
strongly 1
excited 1
my 1
curiosity 1
but 1
the 1
paroxysm 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
had 1
seized 1
the 1
stranger 1
overcame 1
his 1
weakened 1
powers 1
and 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
repose 1
and 1
tranquil 1
conversation 1
were 1
necessary 1
to 1
restore 1
his 1
composure 1
having 1
conquered 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
his 1
feelings 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
despise 1
himself 1
for 1
being 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
quelling 1
the 1
dark 1
tyranny 1
of 1
despair 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
again 1
to 1
converse 1
concerning 1
myself 1
personally 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
earlier 1
years 1
the 1
tale 1
was 1
quickly 1
told 1
but 1
it 1
awakened 1
various 1
trains 1
of 1
reflection 1
i 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
desire 1
of 1
finding 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
my 1
thirst 1
for 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
sympathy 1
with 1
a 1
fellow 1
mind 1
than 1
had 1
ever 1
fallen 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
and 1
expressed 1
my 1
conviction 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
could 1
boast 1
of 1
little 1
happiness 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
this 1
blessing 1
i 1
agree 1
with 1
you 1
replied 1
the 1
stranger 1
we 1
are 1
unfashioned 1
creatures 1
but 1
half 1
made 1
up 1
if 1
one 1
wiser 1
better 1
dearer 1
than 1
ourselvessuch 1
a 1
friend 1
ought 1
to 1
bedo 1
not 1
lend 1
his 1
aid 1
to 1
perfectionate 1
our 1
weak 1
and 1
faulty 1
natures 1
i 1
once 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
the 1
most 1
noble 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
and 1
am 1
entitled 1
therefore 1
to 1
judge 1
respecting 1
friendship 1
you 1
have 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
despair 1
but 1
ii 1
have 1
lost 1
everything 1
and 1
cannot 1
begin 1
life 1
anew 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
countenance 1
became 1
expressive 1
of 1
a 1
calm 1
settled 1
grief 1
that 1
touched 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
presently 1
retired 1
to 1
his 1
cabin 1
even 1
broken 1
in 1
spirit 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
feel 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
he 1
does 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
nature 1
the 1
starry 1
sky 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
every 1
sight 1
afforded 1
by 1
these 1
wonderful 1
regions 1
seem 1
still 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
elevating 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
earth 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
double 1
existence 1
he 1
may 1
suffer 1
misery 1
and 1
be 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
disappointments 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
retired 1
into 1
himself 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
like 1
a 1
celestial 1
spirit 1
that 1
has 1
a 1
halo 1
around 1
him 1
within 1
whose 1
circle 1
no 1
grief 1
or 1
folly 1
ventures 1
will 1
you 1
smile 1
at 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
i 1
express 1
concerning 1
this 1
divine 1
wanderer 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
tutored 1
and 1
refined 1
by 1
books 1
and 1
retirement 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
therefore 1
somewhat 1
fastidious 1
but 1
this 1
only 1
renders 1
you 1
the 1
more 1
fit 1
to 1
appreciate 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
merits 1
of 1
this 1
wonderful 1
man 1
sometimes 1
i 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
quality 1
it 1
is 1
which 1
he 1
possesses 1
that 1
elevates 1
him 1
so 1
immeasurably 1
above 1
any 1
other 1
person 1
i 1
ever 1
knew 1
i 1
believe 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
intuitive 1
discernment 1
a 1
quick 1
but 1
neverfailing 1
power 1
of 1
judgment 1
a 1
penetration 1
into 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
things 1
unequalled 1
for 1
clearness 1
and 1
precision 1
add 1
to 1
this 1
a 1
facility 1
of 1
expression 1
and 1
a 1
voice 1
whose 1
varied 1
intonations 1
are 1
soulsubduing 1

yesterday 1
the 1
stranger 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
perceive 1
captain 1
walton 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
suffered 1
great 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
had 1
determined 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
these 1
evils 1
should 1
die 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
won 1
me 1
to 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
you 1
seek 1
for 1
knowledge 1
and 1
wisdom 1
as 1
i 1
once 1
did 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
gratification 1
of 1
your 1
wishes 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
serpent 1
to 1
sting 1
you 1
as 1
mine 1
has 1
been 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
relation 1
of 1
my 1
disasters 1
will 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
pursuing 1
the 1
same 1
course 1
exposing 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
dangers 1
which 1
have 1
rendered 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
imagine 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
deduce 1
an 1
apt 1
moral 1
from 1
my 1
tale 1
one 1
that 1
may 1
direct 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
succeed 1
in 1
your 1
undertaking 1
and 1
console 1
you 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
failure 1
prepare 1
to 1
hear 1
of 1
occurrences 1
which 1
are 1
usually 1
deemed 1
marvellous 1
were 1
we 1
among 1
the 1
tamer 1
scenes 1
of 1
nature 1
i 1
might 1
fear 1
to 1
encounter 1
your 1
unbelief 1
perhaps 1
your 1
ridicule 1
but 1
many 1
things 1
will 1
appear 1
possible 1
in 1
these 1
wild 1
and 1
mysterious 1
regions 1
which 1
would 1
provoke 1
the 1
laughter 1
of 1
those 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
evervaried 1
powers 1
of 1
nature 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
tale 1
conveys 1
in 1
its 1
series 1
internal 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
composed 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
much 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
offered 1
communication 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
renew 1
his 1
grief 1
by 1
a 1
recital 1
of 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
promised 1
narrative 1
partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
ameliorate 1
his 1
fate 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
i 1
expressed 1
these 1
feelings 1
in 1
my 1
answer 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
he 1
replied 1
for 1
your 1
sympathy 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
my 1
fate 1
is 1
nearly 1
fulfilled 1
i 1
wait 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
event 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
repose 1
in 1
peace 1
i 1
understand 1
your 1
feeling 1
continued 1
he 1
perceiving 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
interrupt 1
him 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
my 1
friend 1
if 1
thus 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
name 1
you 1
nothing 1
can 1
alter 1
my 1
destiny 1
listen 1
to 1
my 1
history 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
perceive 1
how 1
irrevocably 1
it 1
is 1
determined 1
he 1
then 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
commence 1
his 1
narrative 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
leisure 1
this 1
promise 1
drew 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
i 1
have 1
resolved 1
every 1
night 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
imperatively 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
duties 1
to 1
record 1
as 1
nearly 1
as 1
possible 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
words 1
what 1
he 1
has 1
related 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
engaged 1
i 1
will 1
at 1
least 1
make 1
notes 1
this 1
manuscript 1
will 1
doubtless 1
afford 1
you 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
and 1
who 1
hear 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
lipswith 1
what 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
shall 1
i 1
read 1
it 1
in 1
some 1
future 1
day 1
even 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
commence 1
my 1
task 1
his 1
fulltoned 1
voice 1
swells 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
his 1
lustrous 1
eyes 1
dwell 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
melancholy 1
sweetness 1
i 1
see 1
his 1
thin 1
hand 1
raised 1
in 1
animation 1
while 1
the 1
lineaments 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
are 1
irradiated 1
by 1
the 1
soul 1
within 1
strange 1
and 1
harrowing 1

be 1
his 1
story 1

chapter 1
1 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
genevese 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
of 1
that 1
republic 1
my 1
ancestors 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
counsellors 1
and 1
syndics 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
filled 1
several 1
public 1
situations 1
with 1
honour 1
and 1
reputation 1
he 1
was 1
respected 1
by 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
integrity 1
and 1
indefatigable 1
attention 1
to 1
public 1
business 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
perpetually 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
circumstances 1
had 1
prevented 1
his 1
marrying 1
early 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
a 1
family 1
as 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
his 1
marriage 1
illustrate 1
his 1
character 1
i 1
cannot 1
refrain 1
from 1
relating 1
them 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
most 1
intimate 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
from 1
a 1
flourishing 1
state 1
fell 1
through 1
numerous 1
mischances 1
into 1
poverty 1
this 1
man 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
beaufort 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
proud 1
and 1
unbending 1
disposition 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
oblivion 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
country 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
distinguished 1
for 1
his 1
rank 1
and 1
magnificence 1
having 1
paid 1
his 1
debts 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
honourable 1
manner 1
he 1
retreated 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
lucerne 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
unknown 1
and 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
my 1
father 1
loved 1
beaufort 1
with 1
the 1
truest 1
friendship 1
and 1
was 1
deeply 1
grieved 1
by 1
his 1
retreat 1
in 1
these 1
unfortunate 1
circumstances 1
he 1
bitterly 1
deplored 1
the 1
false 1
pride 1
which 1
led 1
his 1
friend 1
to 1
a 1
conduct 1
so 1
little 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
affection 1
that 1
united 1
them 1
he 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
him 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
persuading 1
him 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
world 1
again 1
through 1
his 1
credit 1
and 1
assistance 1
beaufort 1
had 1
taken 1
effectual 1
measures 1
to 1
conceal 1
himself 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
ten 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
father 1
discovered 1
his 1
abode 1
overjoyed 1
at 1
this 1
discovery 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
was 1
situated 1
in 1
a 1
mean 1
street 1
near 1
the 1
reuss 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
misery 1
and 1
despair 1
alone 1
welcomed 1
him 1
beaufort 1
had 1
saved 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
from 1
the 1
wreck 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
provide 1
him 1
with 1
sustenance 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
hoped 1
to 1
procure 1
some 1
respectable 1
employment 1
in 1
a 1
merchants 1
house 1
the 1
interval 1
was 1
consequently 1
spent 1
in 1
inaction 1
his 1
grief 1
only 1
became 1
more 1
deep 1
and 1
rankling 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
leisure 1
for 1
reflection 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
took 1
so 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
months 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
sickness 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
his 1
daughter 1
attended 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
tenderness 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
with 1
despair 1
that 1
their 1
little 1
fund 1
was 1
rapidly 1
decreasing 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
prospect 1
of 1
support 1
but 1
caroline 1
beaufort 1
possessed 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
an 1
uncommon 1
mould 1
and 1
her 1
courage 1
rose 1
to 1
support 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
adversity 1
she 1
procured 1
plain 1
work 1
she 1
plaited 1
straw 1
and 1
by 1
various 1
means 1
contrived 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
pittance 1
scarcely 1
sufficient 1
to 1
support 1
life 1
several 1
months 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
her 1
father 1
grew 1
worse 1
her 1
time 1
was 1
more 1
entirely 1
occupied 1
in 1
attending 1
him 1
her 1
means 1
of 1
subsistence 1
decreased 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
tenth 1
month 1
her 1
father 1
died 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
leaving 1
her 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
this 1
last 1
blow 1
overcame 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
knelt 1
by 1
beauforts 1
coffin 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
he 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
protecting 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
committed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
care 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
interment 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
he 1
conducted 1
her 1
to 1
geneva 1
and 1
placed 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
a 1
relation 1
two 1
years 1
after 1
this 1
event 1
caroline 1
became 1
his 1
wife 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
ages 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
but 1
this 1
circumstance 1
seemed 1
to 1
unite 1
them 1
only 1
closer 1
in 1
bonds 1
of 1
devoted 1
affection 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
justice 1
in 1
my 1
fathers 1
upright 1
mind 1
which 1
rendered 1
it 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
approve 1
highly 1
to 1
love 1
strongly 1
perhaps 1
during 1
former 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
from 1
the 1
latediscovered 1
unworthiness 1
of 1
one 1
beloved 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
disposed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
greater 1
value 1
on 1
tried 1
worth 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
gratitude 1
and 1
worship 1
in 1
his 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
differing 1
wholly 1
from 1
the 1
doting 1
fondness 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
inspired 1
by 1
reverence 1
for 1
her 1
virtues 1
and 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
recompensing 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
sorrows 1
she 1
had 1
endured 1
but 1
which 1
gave 1
inexpressible 1
grace 1
to 1
his 1
behaviour 1
to 1
her 1
everything 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
her 1
wishes 1
and 1
her 1
convenience 1
he 1
strove 1
to 1
shelter 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
fair 1
exotic 1
is 1
sheltered 1
by 1
the 1
gardener 1
from 1
every 1
rougher 1
wind 1
and 1
to 1
surround 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
could 1
tend 1
to 1
excite 1
pleasurable 1
emotion 1
in 1
her 1
soft 1
and 1
benevolent 1
mind 1
her 1
health 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
her 1
hitherto 1
constant 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
shaken 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
during 1
the 1
two 1
years 1
that 1
had 1
elapsed 1
previous 1
to 1
their 1
marriage 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gradually 1
relinquished 1
all 1
his 1
public 1
functions 1
and 1
immediately 1
after 1
their 1
union 1
they 1
sought 1
the 1
pleasant 1
climate 1
of 1
italy 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
interest 1
attendant 1
on 1
a 1
tour 1
through 1
that 1
land 1
of 1
wonders 1
as 1
a 1
restorative 1

they 1
were 1

seemed 1
to 1
draw 1
inexhaustible 1
stores 1
of 1
affection 1

mine 1

as 1
they 1
fulfilled 1
their 1
duties 1

this 1
deep 1
consciousness 1
of 1
what 1

owed 1

spirit 1
of 1
tenderness 1
that 1
animated 1
both 1

may 1
be 1
imagined 1
that 1
while 1
during 1
every 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
infant 1
life 1
i 1
received 1
a 1
lesson 1
of 1
patience 1
of 1
charity 1
and 1
of 1
selfcontrol 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
but 1
one 1
train 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
their 1
only 1
care 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
much 1
desired 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
but 1
i 1
continued 1
their 1
single 1
offspring 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
years 1
old 1
while 1
making 1
an 1
excursion 1
beyond 1
the 1
frontiers 1
of 1
italy 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
week 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
of 1
como 1
their 1
benevolent 1
disposition 1
often 1
made 1
them 1
enter 1
the 1
cottages 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
this 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
duty 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
necessity 1
a 1
passionremembering 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
relievedfor 1

the 1

during 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
walks 1
a 1
poor 1
cot 1
in 1
the 1
foldings 1
of 1
a 1
vale 1
attracted 1
their 1
notice 1
as 1
being 1
singularly 1
disconsolate 1
while 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
halfclothed 1
children 1
gathered 1
about 1
it 1
spoke 1
of 1
penury 1
in 1
its 1
worst 1
shape 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
himself 1
to 1
milan 1
my 1
mother 1
accompanied 1
by 1
me 1
visited 1
this 1
abode 1
she 1
found 1
a 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
hard 1
working 1
bent 1
down 1
by 1
care 1
and 1
labour 1
distributing 1
a 1
scanty 1
meal 1
to 1
five 1
hungry 1
babes 1
among 1
these 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
attracted 1
my 1
mother 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
she 1
appeared 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
stock 1
the 1
four 1
others 1
were 1
darkeyed 1
hardy 1
little 1
vagrants 1
this 1
child 1
was 1
thin 1
and 1
very 1
fair 1
her 1
hair 1
was 1
the 1
brightest 1
living 1
gold 1
and 1
despite 1
the 1
poverty 1
of 1
her 1
clothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
crown 1
of 1
distinction 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
her 1
brow 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
ample 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
cloudless 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
so 1
expressive 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
behold 1
her 1
without 1
looking 1
on 1
her 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
distinct 1
species 1
a 1
being 1
heavensent 1
and 1
bearing 1
a 1
celestial 1
stamp 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
features 1
the 1
peasant 1
woman 1
perceiving 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
fixed 1
eyes 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
admiration 1
on 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
eagerly 1
communicated 1
her 1
history 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
child 1
but 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
milanese 1
nobleman 1
her 1
mother 1

a 1

better 1
off 1
then 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
long 1
married 1
and 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
but 1
just 1
born 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
their 1
charge 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
italians 1
nursed 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
glory 1
of 1
italyone 1
among 1
the 1
schiavi 1

who 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
obtain 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
he 1
became 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
its 1
weakness 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
died 1
or 1
still 1
lingered 1
in 1
the 1
dungeons 1
of 1
austria 1

not 1
known 1
his 1
property 1
was 1
confiscated 1
his 1
child 1
became 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
she 1
continued 1
with 1
her 1
foster 1
parents 1
and 1
bloomed 1
in 1
their 1
rude 1
abode 1
fairer 1
than 1
a 1
garden 1
rose 1
among 1
darkleaved 1
brambles 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
returned 1
from 1
milan 1
he 1
found 1
playing 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
our 1
villa 1
a 1
child 1
fairer 1
than 1
pictured 1
cheruba 1
creature 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
shed 1
radiance 1
from 1
her 1
looks 1
and 1
whose 1
form 1
and 1
motions 1
were 1
lighter 1
than 1
the 1
chamois 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
the 1
apparition 1
was 1
soon 1
explained 1
with 1
his 1
permission 1
my 1
mother 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
rustic 1
guardians 1
to 1
yield 1
their 1
charge 1
to 1
her 1
they 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
orphan 1
her 1
presence 1
had 1
seemed 1
a 1
blessing 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unfair 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
when 1
providence 1
afforded 1
her 1
such 1
powerful 1
protection 1
they 1
consulted 1
their 1
village 1
priest 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
lavenza 1
became 1
the 1
inmate 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
housemy 1
more 1

passionate 1
and 1
almost 1
reverential 1
attachment 1
with 1
which 1
all 1

i 1
shared 1
it 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
my 1
delight 1

the 1
evening 1
previous 1
to 1
her 1
being 1
brought 1
to 1
my 1
home 1
my 1

on 1
the 1

she 1
presented 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
promised 1
gift 1
i 1
with 1
childish 1
seriousness 1
interpreted 1
her 1
words 1
literally 1
and 1
looked 1
upon 1
elizabeth 1
as 1
minemine 1
to 1
protect 1
love 1
and 1
cherish 1
all 1
praises 1
bestowed 1
on 1

up 1
together 1

not 1
quite 1
a 1
year 1
difference 1
in 1
our 1
ages 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
strangers 1
to 1
any 1
species 1
of 1
disunion 1
or 1
dispute 1
harmony 1
was 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
our 1
companionship 1
and 1
the 1
diversity 1
and 1
contrast 1
that 1
subsisted 1
in 1
our 1
characters 1
drew 1
us 1
nearer 1
together 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
concentrated 1
disposition 1
but 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ardour 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
more 1
intense 1
application 1
and 1
was 1
more 1
deeply 1
smitten 1
with 1
the 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
she 1
busied 1
herself 1
with 1
following 1
the 1
aerial 1
creations 1
of 1
the 1
poets 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
majestic 1
and 1
wondrous 1
scenes 1
which 1
surrounded 1
our 1
swiss 1
home 1
the 1
sublime 1
shapes 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1

changes 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1

silence 1
of 1

the 1

turbulence 1
of 1
our 1
alpine 1
summersshe 1
found 1
ample 1
scope 1
for 1
admiration 1
and 1
delight 1
while 1
my 1
companion 1
contemplated 1
with 1
a 1
serious 1
and 1
satisfied 1
spirit 1
the 1
magnificent 1
appearances 1
of 1
things 1
i 1
delighted 1
in 1
investigating 1
their 1
causes 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
divine 1
curiosity 1
earnest 1
research 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
hidden 1
laws 1
of 1
nature 1
gladness 1
akin 1
to 1
rapture 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
unfolded 1
to 1
me 1
are 1
among 1
the 1
earliest 1
sensations 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
on 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
son 1
my 1
junior 1
by 1
seven 1
years 1
my 1
parents 1
gave 1
up 1
entirely 1
their 1
wandering 1
life 1
and 1
fixed 1
themselves 1
in 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
possessed 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
geneva 1
and 1
a 1
campagne 1
on 1
belrive 1
the 1
eastern 1
shore 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
we 1
resided 1
principally 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
and 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
were 1
passed 1
in 1
considerable 1
seclusion 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
temper 1
to 1
avoid 1
a 1
crowd 1
and 1
to 1
attach 1
myself 1
fervently 1
to 1
a 1
few 1
i 1
was 1
indifferent 1
therefore 1
to 1
my 1
schoolfellows 1
in 1
general 1
but 1
i 1
united 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bonds 1
of 1
the 1
closest 1
friendship 1
to 1
one 1
among 1
them 1
henry 1
clerval 1
was 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
a 1
merchant 1
of 1
geneva 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
singular 1
talent 1
and 1
fancy 1
he 1
loved 1
enterprise 1
hardship 1
and 1
even 1
danger 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
of 1
chivalry 1
and 1
romance 1
he 1
composed 1
heroic 1
songs 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
write 1
many 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
enchantment 1
and 1
knightly 1
adventure 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
act 1
plays 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
masquerades 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
characters 1
were 1
drawn 1
from 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
roncesvalles 1
of 1
the 1
round 1
table 1
of 1
king 1
arthur 1
and 1
the 1
chivalrous 1
train 1
who 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
to 1
redeem 1
the 1
holy 1
sepulchre 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
infidels 1
no 1
human 1
being 1
could 1
have 1
passed 1
a 1
happier 1
childhood 1
than 1
myself 1
my 1
parents 1
were 1
possessed 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
spirit 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
indulgence 1
we 1
felt 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
the 1
tyrants 1
to 1
rule 1
our 1
lot 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
caprice 1
but 1
the 1
agents 1
and 1
creators 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
many 1
delights 1
which 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
when 1
i 1
mingled 1
with 1
other 1
families 1
i 1
distinctly 1
discerned 1
how 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
my 1
lot 1
was 1
and 1
gratitude 1
assisted 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
filial 1
love 1
my 1
temper 1
was 1
sometimes 1
violent 1
and 1
my 1
passions 1
vehement 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
law 1
in 1
my 1
temperature 1
they 1
were 1
turned 1
not 1
towards 1
childish 1
pursuits 1
but 1
to 1
an 1
eager 1
desire 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
learn 1
all 1
things 1
indiscriminately 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
neither 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
languages 1
nor 1
the 1
code 1
of 1
governments 1
nor 1
the 1
politics 1
of 1
various 1
states 1
possessed 1
attractions 1
for 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
that 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
outward 1
substance 1
of 1
things 1
or 1
the 1
inner 1
spirit 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
mysterious 1
soul 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
occupied 1
me 1
still 1
my 1
inquiries 1
were 1
directed 1
to 1
the 1
metaphysical 1
or 1
in 1
its 1
highest 1
sense 1
the 1
physical 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
meanwhile 1
clerval 1
occupied 1
himself 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
moral 1
relations 1
of 1
things 1
the 1
busy 1
stage 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
heroes 1
and 1
the 1
actions 1
of 1
men 1
were 1
his 1
theme 1
and 1
his 1
hope 1
and 1
his 1
dream 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
one 1
among 1
those 1
whose 1
names 1
are 1
recorded 1
in 1
story 1
as 1
the 1
gallant 1
and 1
adventurous 1
benefactors 1
of 1
our 1
species 1
the 1
saintly 1
soul 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
shone 1
like 1
a 1
shrinededicated 1
lamp 1
in 1
our 1
peaceful 1
home 1

become 1
sullen 1
in 1
my 1
study 1
rough 1
through 1
the 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
subdue 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
semblance 1
of 1
her 1
own 1

the 1

soaring 1

feel 1
exquisite 1
pleasure 1
in 1
dwelling 1
on 1
the 1
recollections 1
of 1
childhood 1
before 1
misfortune 1
had 1
tainted 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
changed 1
its 1
bright 1
visions 1
of 1
extensive 1
usefulness 1
into 1
gloomy 1
and 1
narrow 1
reflections 1
upon 1
self 1
besides 1
in 1
drawing 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
days 1
i 1
also 1
record 1
those 1
events 1
which 1
led 1
by 1
insensible 1
steps 1
to 1
my 1
after 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
for 1
when 1
i 1
would 1
account 1
to 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
that 1
passion 1
which 1
afterwards 1
ruled 1
my 1
destiny 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
arise 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
river 1
from 1
ignoble 1
and 1
almost 1
forgotten 1
sources 1
but 1
swelling 1
as 1
it 1
proceeded 1
it 1
became 1
the 1
torrent 1
which 1
in 1
its 1
course 1
has 1
swept 1
away 1
all 1
my 1
hopes 1
and 1
joys 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
is 1
the 1
genius 1
that 1
has 1
regulated 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
desire 1
therefore 1
in 1
this 1
narration 1
to 1
state 1
those 1
facts 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
predilection 1
for 1
that 1
science 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
thirteen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
we 1
all 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
party 1
of 1
pleasure 1
to 1
the 1
baths 1
near 1
thonon 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
obliged 1
us 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
day 1
confined 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
in 1
this 1
house 1
i 1
chanced 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
i 1
opened 1
it 1
with 1
apathy 1
the 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
attempts 1
to 1
demonstrate 1
and 1
the 1
wonderful 1
facts 1
which 1
he 1
relates 1
soon 1
changed 1
this 1
feeling 1
into 1
enthusiasm 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
seemed 1
to 1
dawn 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
i 1
communicated 1
my 1
discovery 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
father 1
looked 1
carelessly 1
at 1
the 1
title 1
page 1
of 1
my 1
book 1
and 1
said 1
ah 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
do 1
not 1
waste 1
your 1
time 1
upon 1
this 1
it 1
is 1
sad 1
trash 1
if 1
instead 1
of 1
this 1
remark 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
pains 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
principles 1
of 1
agrippa 1
had 1
been 1
entirely 1
exploded 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
modern 1
system 1
of 1
science 1
had 1
been 1
introduced 1
which 1
possessed 1
much 1
greater 1
powers 1
than 1
the 1
ancient 1
because 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
were 1
chimerical 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
former 1
were 1
real 1
and 1
practical 1
under 1
such 1
circumstances 1
i 1
should 1
certainly 1
have 1
thrown 1
agrippa 1
aside 1
and 1
have 1
contented 1
my 1
imagination 1
warmed 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
returning 1
with 1
greater 1
ardour 1
to 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
it 1
is 1
even 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
received 1
the 1
fatal 1
impulse 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
ruin 1
but 1
the 1
cursory 1
glance 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
my 1
volume 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
its 1
contents 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
read 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
avidity 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
whole 1
works 1
of 1
this 1
author 1
and 1
afterwards 1
of 1
paracelsus 1
and 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
studied 1
the 1
wild 1
fancies 1
of 1
these 1
writers 1
with 1
delight 1
they 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
treasures 1
known 1
to 1
few 1
besides 1
myself 1
i 1
have 1
described 1
myself 1
as 1
always 1
having 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
a 1
fervent 1
longing 1
to 1
penetrate 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
nature 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
intense 1
labour 1
and 1
wonderful 1
discoveries 1
of 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
i 1
always 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
studies 1
discontented 1
and 1
unsatisfied 1
sir 1
isaac 1
newton 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
avowed 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
picking 1
up 1
shells 1
beside 1
the 1
great 1
and 1
unexplored 1
ocean 1
of 1
truth 1
those 1
of 1
his 1
successors 1
in 1
each 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
acquainted 1
appeared 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
boys 1
apprehensions 1
as 1
tyros 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
pursuit 1
the 1
untaught 1
peasant 1
beheld 1
the 1
elements 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
their 1
practical 1
uses 1
the 1
most 1
learned 1
philosopher 1
knew 1
little 1
more 1
he 1
had 1
partially 1
unveiled 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
nature 1
but 1
her 1
immortal 1
lineaments 1
were 1
still 1
a 1
wonder 1
and 1
a 1
mystery 1
he 1
might 1
dissect 1
anatomize 1
and 1
give 1
names 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
a 1
final 1
cause 1
causes 1
in 1
their 1
secondary 1
and 1
tertiary 1
grades 1
were 1
utterly 1
unknown 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
gazed 1
upon 1
the 1
fortifications 1
and 1
impediments 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
keep 1
human 1
beings 1
from 1
entering 1
the 1
citadel 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
rashly 1
and 1
ignorantly 1
i 1
had 1
repined 1
but 1
here 1
were 1
books 1
and 1
here 1
were 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
penetrated 1
deeper 1
and 1
knew 1
more 1
i 1
took 1
their 1
word 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
they 1
averred 1
and 1
i 1
became 1
their 1
disciple 1
it 1
may 1
appear 1
strange 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
arise 1
in 1
the 1
eighteenth 1
century 1
but 1
while 1
i 1
followed 1
the 1
routine 1
of 1
education 1
in 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
geneva 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
selftaught 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
my 1
favourite 1
studies 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
not 1
scientific 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
struggle 1
with 1
a 1
childs 1
blindness 1
added 1
to 1
a 1
students 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
under 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
my 1
new 1
preceptors 1
i 1
entered 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
diligence 1
into 1
the 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
philosophers 1
stone 1
and 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
latter 1
soon 1
obtained 1
my 1
undivided 1
attention 1
wealth 1
was 1
an 1
inferior 1
object 1
but 1
what 1
glory 1
would 1
attend 1
the 1
discovery 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
banish 1
disease 1
from 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
render 1
man 1
invulnerable 1
to 1
any 1
but 1
a 1
violent 1
death 1
nor 1
were 1
these 1
my 1
only 1
visions 1
the 1
raising 1
of 1
ghosts 1
or 1
devils 1
was 1
a 1
promise 1
liberally 1
accorded 1
by 1
my 1
favourite 1
authors 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
most 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
and 1
if 1
my 1
incantations 1
were 1
always 1
unsuccessful 1
i 1
attributed 1
the 1
failure 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
inexperience 1
and 1
mistake 1
than 1
to 1
a 1
want 1
of 1
skill 1
or 1
fidelity 1
in 1
my 1
instructors 1
and 1
thus 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
exploded 1
systems 1
mingling 1
like 1
an 1
unadept 1
a 1
thousand 1
contradictory 1
theories 1
and 1
floundering 1
desperately 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
slough 1
of 1
multifarious 1
knowledge 1
guided 1
by 1
an 1
ardent 1
imagination 1
and 1
childish 1
reasoning 1
till 1
an 1
accident 1
again 1
changed 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
we 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
near 1
belrive 1
when 1
we 1
witnessed 1
a 1
most 1
violent 1
and 1
terrible 1
thunderstorm 1
it 1
advanced 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
jura 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
at 1
once 1
with 1
frightful 1
loudness 1
from 1
various 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
i 1
remained 1
while 1
the 1
storm 1
lasted 1
watching 1
its 1
progress 1
with 1
curiosity 1
and 1
delight 1
as 1
i 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
fire 1
issue 1
from 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
beautiful 1
oak 1
which 1
stood 1
about 1
twenty 1
yards 1
from 1
our 1
house 1
and 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dazzling 1
light 1
vanished 1
the 1
oak 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
nothing 1
remained 1
but 1
a 1
blasted 1
stump 1
when 1
we 1
visited 1
it 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
tree 1
shattered 1
in 1
a 1
singular 1
manner 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
splintered 1
by 1
the 1
shock 1
but 1
entirely 1
reduced 1
to 1
thin 1
ribbons 1
of 1
wood 1
i 1
never 1
beheld 1
anything 1
so 1
utterly 1
destroyed 1
before 1
this 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
laws 1
of 1
electricity 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
research 1
in 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
was 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
excited 1
by 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
he 1
entered 1
on 1
the 1
explanation 1
of 1
a 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
electricity 1
and 1
galvanism 1
which 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
new 1
and 1
astonishing 1
to 1
me 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
threw 1
greatly 1
into 1
the 1
shade 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
the 1
lords 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
fatality 1
the 1
overthrow 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
disinclined 1
me 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
accustomed 1
studies 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
nothing 1
would 1
or 1
could 1
ever 1
be 1
known 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
engaged 1
my 1
attention 1
suddenly 1
grew 1
despicable 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
caprices 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
perhaps 1
most 1
subject 1
to 1
in 1
early 1
youth 1
i 1
at 1
once 1
gave 1
up 1
my 1
former 1
occupations 1
set 1
down 1
natural 1
history 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
progeny 1
as 1
a 1
deformed 1
and 1
abortive 1
creation 1
and 1
entertained 1
the 1
greatest 1
disdain 1
for 1
a 1
wouldbe 1
science 1
which 1
could 1
never 1
even 1
step 1
within 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
real 1
knowledge 1
in 1
this 1
mood 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
betook 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mathematics 1
and 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
study 1
appertaining 1
to 1
that 1
science 1
as 1
being 1
built 1
upon 1
secure 1
foundations 1
and 1
so 1
worthy 1
of 1
my 1
consideration 1
thus 1
strangely 1
are 1
our 1
souls 1
constructed 1
and 1
by 1
such 1
slight 1
ligaments 1
are 1
we 1
bound 1
to 1
prosperity 1
or 1
ruin 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
almost 1
miraculous 1
change 1
of 1
inclination 1
and 1
will 1
was 1
the 1
immediate 1
suggestion 1
of 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
of 1
my 1
lifethe 1
last 1
effort 1
made 1
by 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
preservation 1
to 1
avert 1
the 1
storm 1
that 1
was 1
even 1
then 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
envelop 1
me 1
her 1
victory 1
was 1
announced 1
by 1
an 1
unusual 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
gladness 1
of 1
soul 1
which 1
followed 1
the 1
relinquishing 1
of 1
my 1
ancient 1
and 1
latterly 1
tormenting 1
studies 1
it 1
was 1
thus 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
taught 1
to 1
associate 1
evil 1
with 1
their 1
prosecution 1
happiness 1
with 1
their 1
disregard 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
strong 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
ineffectual 1
destiny 1
was 1
too 1
potent 1
and 1
her 1
immutable 1
laws 1
had 1
decreed 1
my 1
utter 1
and 1
terrible 1
destruction 1
chapter 1

when 1
i 1
had 1
attained 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
seventeen 1
my 1
parents 1
resolved 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
become 1
a 1
student 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
attended 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
geneva 1
but 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
education 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
made 1
acquainted 1
with 1
other 1
customs 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
my 1
departure 1
was 1
therefore 1
fixed 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
date 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
resolved 1
upon 1
could 1
arrive 1

illness 1
many 1
arguments 1
had 1
been 1
urged 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
attending 1
upon 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
yielded 1
to 1
our 1
entreaties 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
her 1
favourite 1
was 1
menaced 1
she 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
control 1
her 1
anxiety 1
she 1
attended 1
her 1
sickbed 1
her 1
watchful 1
attentions 1
triumphed 1
over 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
distemperelizabeth 1
was 1
saved 1
but 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
this 1
imprudence 1
were 1
fatal 1
to 1
her 1
preserver 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
my 1
mother 1
sickened 1
her 1
fever 1
was 1
accompanied 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
alarming 1
symptoms 1
and 1
the 1
looks 1
of 1
her 1
medical 1
attendants 1
prognosticated 1
the 1
worst 1
event 1
on 1
her 1
deathbed 1
the 1
fortitude 1
and 1
benignity 1
of 1
this 1
best 1
of 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
desert 1

joined 1

hands 1
of 1

my 1
children 1

my 1
firmest 1
hopes 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
were 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
your 1
union 1

expectation 1
will 1
now 1
be 1
the 1
consolation 1
of 1
your 1

my 1
love 1
you 1
must 1
supply 1
my 1
place 1
to 1
my 1
younger 1
children 1
alas 1
i 1
regret 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
taken 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
quit 1
you 1
all 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
thoughts 1
befitting 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
resign 1
myself 1
cheerfully 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
will 1
indulge 1
a 1
hope 1
of 1
meeting 1
you 1
in 1
another 1
world 1
she 1
died 1
calmly 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
affection 1
even 1
in 1
death 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
describe 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
dearest 1
ties 1
are 1
rent 1
by 1
that 1
most 1
irreparable 1
evil 1
the 1
void 1
that 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
is 1
exhibited 1
on 1
the 1
countenance 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
mind 1
can 1
persuade 1
itself 1
that 1
she 1
whom 1
we 1
saw 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
existence 1
appeared 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
can 1
have 1
departed 1
foreverthat 1
the 1
brightness 1
of 1
a 1
beloved 1
eye 1
can 1
have 1
been 1
extinguished 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
can 1
be 1
hushed 1
never 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
days 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
lapse 1
of 1
time 1
proves 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
then 1
the 1
actual 1
bitterness 1
of 1
grief 1
commences 1
yet 1
from 1
whom 1
has 1
not 1
that 1
rude 1
hand 1
rent 1
away 1
some 1
dear 1
connection 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
describe 1
a 1
sorrow 1
which 1
all 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
must 1
feel 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
length 1
arrives 1
when 1
grief 1
is 1
rather 1
an 1
indulgence 1
than 1
a 1
necessity 1
and 1
the 1
smile 1
that 1
plays 1
upon 1
the 1
lips 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
deemed 1
a 1
sacrilege 1
is 1
not 1
banished 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
dead 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
still 1
duties 1
which 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
perform 1
we 1
must 1
continue 1
our 1
course 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
learn 1
to 1
think 1
ourselves 1
fortunate 1
whilst 1
one 1
remains 1
whom 1
the 1
spoiler 1
has 1
not 1
seized 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
deferred 1
by 1
these 1
events 1
was 1
now 1
again 1
determined 1
upon 1
i 1
obtained 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
a 1
respite 1
of 1
some 1
weeks 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
sacrilege 1
so 1
soon 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
repose 1
akin 1
to 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
and 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
was 1
new 1
to 1
sorrow 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
the 1
less 1
alarm 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
those 1
that 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
sweet 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
consoled 1
she 1
indeed 1
veiled 1
her 1
grief 1
and 1
strove 1
to 1
act 1
the 1
comforter 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
she 1
looked 1
steadily 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
assumed 1
its 1
duties 1
with 1
courage 1
and 1
zeal 1
she 1
devoted 1
herself 1
to 1
those 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
call 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
cousins 1
never 1
was 1
she 1
so 1
enchanting 1
as 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
when 1
she 1
recalled 1
the 1
sunshine 1
of 1
her 1
smiles 1
and 1
spent 1
them 1
upon 1
us 1
she 1
forgot 1
even 1
her 1
own 1
regret 1
in 1
her 1
endeavours 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
forget 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
at 1
length 1
arrived 1
clerval 1
spent 1
the 1
last 1
evening 1
with 1
us 1
he 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
persuade 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
accompany 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
become 1
my 1
fellow 1
student 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
his 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
narrowminded 1
trader 1
and 1
saw 1
idleness 1
and 1
ruin 1
in 1
the 1
aspirations 1
and 1
ambition 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
henry 1
deeply 1
felt 1
the 1
misfortune 1
of 1
being 1
debarred 1
from 1
a 1
liberal 1
education 1
he 1
said 1
little 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
spoke 1
i 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
kindling 1
eye 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
animated 1
glance 1
a 1
restrained 1
but 1
firm 1
resolve 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
chained 1
to 1
the 1
miserable 1
details 1
of 1
commerce 1
we 1
sat 1
late 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
ourselves 1
away 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
nor 1
persuade 1
ourselves 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
word 1
farewell 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
and 1
we 1
retired 1
under 1
the 1
pretence 1
of 1
seeking 1
repose 1
each 1
fancying 1
that 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
deceived 1
but 1
when 1
at 1
mornings 1
dawn 1
i 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
carriage 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
theremy 1
father 1
again 1
to 1
bless 1
me 1
clerval 1
to 1
press 1
my 1
hand 1
once 1
more 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
renew 1
her 1
entreaties 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
write 1
often 1
and 1
to 1
bestow 1
the 1
last 1
feminine 1
attentions 1
on 1
her 1
playmate 1
and 1
friend 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
chaise 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
and 1
indulged 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
melancholy 1
reflections 1
i 1
who 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
surrounded 1
by 1
amiable 1
companions 1
continually 1
engaged 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
bestow 1
mutual 1
pleasurei 1
was 1
now 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
university 1
whither 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
i 1
must 1
form 1
my 1
own 1
friends 1
and 1
be 1
my 1
own 1
protector 1
my 1
life 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
remarkably 1
secluded 1
and 1
domestic 1
and 1
this 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
invincible 1
repugnance 1
to 1
new 1
countenances 1
i 1
loved 1
my 1
brothers 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
clerval 1
these 1
were 1
old 1
familiar 1
faces 1
but 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
totally 1
unfitted 1
for 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
strangers 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
as 1
i 1
commenced 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
my 1
spirits 1
and 1
hopes 1
rose 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
the 1
acquisition 1
of 1
knowledge 1
i 1
had 1
often 1
when 1
at 1
home 1
thought 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
remain 1
during 1
my 1
youth 1
cooped 1
up 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
and 1
had 1
longed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
take 1
my 1
station 1
among 1
other 1
human 1
beings 1
now 1
my 1
desires 1
were 1
complied 1
with 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
have 1
been 1
folly 1
to 1
repent 1
i 1
had 1
sufficient 1
leisure 1
for 1
these 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
reflections 1
during 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
fatiguing 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
high 1
white 1
steeple 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
met 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
alighted 1
and 1
was 1
conducted 1
to 1
my 1
solitary 1
apartment 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
evening 1
as 1
i 1
pleased 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
delivered 1
my 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
professors 1
chanceor 1
rather 1
the 1
evil 1
influence 1
the 1
angel 1
of 1
destruction 1
which 1
asserted 1
omnipotent 1
sway 1
over 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
turned 1
my 1
reluctant 1
steps 1
from 1
my 1
fathers 1
doorled 1
me 1
first 1
to 1
m 1
krempe 1
professor 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
uncouth 1
man 1
but 1
deeply 1
imbued 1
in 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
his 1
science 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
several 1
questions 1
concerning 1
my 1
progress 1
in 1
the 1
different 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
appertaining 1
to 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
i 1
replied 1
carelessly 1
and 1
partly 1
in 1
contempt 1
mentioned 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
my 1
alchemists 1
as 1
the 1
principal 1
authors 1
i 1
had 1
studied 1
the 1
professor 1
stared 1
have 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
really 1
spent 1
your 1
time 1
in 1
studying 1
such 1
nonsense 1
i 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
every 1
minute 1
continued 1
m 1
krempe 1
with 1
warmth 1
every 1
instant 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
wasted 1
on 1
those 1
books 1
is 1
utterly 1
and 1
entirely 1
lost 1
you 1
have 1
burdened 1
your 1
memory 1
with 1
exploded 1
systems 1
and 1
useless 1
names 1
good 1
god 1
in 1
what 1
desert 1
land 1
have 1
you 1
lived 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
inform 1
you 1
that 1
these 1
fancies 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
greedily 1
imbibed 1
are 1
a 1
thousand 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
as 1
musty 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
ancient 1
i 1
little 1
expected 1
in 1
this 1
enlightened 1
and 1
scientific 1
age 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
disciple 1
of 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
begin 1
your 1
studies 1
entirely 1
anew 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
stepped 1
aside 1
and 1
wrote 1
down 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
several 1
books 1
treating 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
he 1
desired 1
me 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
dismissed 1
me 1
after 1
mentioning 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
week 1
he 1
intended 1
to 1
commence 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
upon 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
its 1
general 1
relations 1
and 1
that 1
m 1
waldman 1
a 1
fellow 1
professor 1
would 1
lecture 1
upon 1
chemistry 1
the 1
alternate 1
days 1
that 1
he 1
omitted 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
not 1
disappointed 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
long 1
considered 1
those 1
authors 1
useless 1
whom 1
the 1
professor 1
reprobated 1
but 1
i 1
returned 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
inclined 1
to 1
recur 1
to 1
these 1
studies 1
in 1
any 1
shape 1
m 1
krempe 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
squat 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
gruff 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
repulsive 1
countenance 1
the 1
teacher 1
therefore 1
did 1
not 1
prepossess 1
me 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
his 1
pursuits 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
too 1
philosophical 1
and 1
connected 1
a 1
strain 1
perhaps 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
conclusions 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
concerning 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
results 1
promised 1
by 1
the 1
modern 1
professors 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
with 1
a 1
confusion 1
of 1
ideas 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
accounted 1
for 1
by 1
my 1
extreme 1
youth 1
and 1
my 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
guide 1
on 1
such 1
matters 1
i 1
had 1
retrod 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
knowledge 1
along 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
exchanged 1
the 1
discoveries 1
of 1
recent 1
inquirers 1
for 1
the 1
dreams 1
of 1
forgotten 1
alchemists 1
besides 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
modern 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
different 1
when 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
sought 1
immortality 1
and 1
power 1
such 1
views 1
although 1
futile 1
were 1
grand 1
but 1
now 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
changed 1
the 1
ambition 1
of 1
the 1
inquirer 1
seemed 1
to 1
limit 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
those 1
visions 1
on 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
in 1
science 1
was 1
chiefly 1
founded 1
i 1
was 1
required 1
to 1
exchange 1
chimeras 1
of 1
boundless 1
grandeur 1
for 1
realities 1
of 1
little 1
worth 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
residence 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
were 1
chiefly 1
spent 1
in 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
localities 1
and 1
the 1
principal 1
residents 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
abode 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
ensuing 1
week 1
commenced 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
which 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
concerning 1
the 1
lectures 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
hear 1
that 1
little 1
conceited 1
fellow 1
deliver 1
sentences 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
pulpit 1
i 1
recollected 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
m 1
waldman 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
idleness 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
lecturing 1
room 1
which 1
m 1
waldman 1
entered 1
shortly 1
after 1
this 1
professor 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
his 1
colleague 1
he 1
appeared 1
about 1
fifty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
but 1
with 1
an 1
aspect 1
expressive 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
benevolence 1
a 1
few 1
grey 1
hairs 1
covered 1
his 1
temples 1
but 1
those 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
nearly 1
black 1
his 1
person 1
was 1
short 1
but 1
remarkably 1
erect 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
the 1
sweetest 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
he 1
began 1
his 1
lecture 1
by 1
a 1
recapitulation 1
of 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
chemistry 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
improvements 1
made 1
by 1
different 1
men 1
of 1
learning 1
pronouncing 1
with 1
fervour 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
discoverers 1
he 1
then 1
took 1
a 1
cursory 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
and 1
explained 1
many 1
of 1
its 1
elementary 1
terms 1
after 1
having 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
preparatory 1
experiments 1
he 1
concluded 1
with 1
a 1
panegyric 1
upon 1
modern 1
chemistry 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
the 1
ancient 1
teachers 1
of 1
this 1
science 1
said 1
he 1
promised 1
impossibilities 1
and 1
performed 1
nothing 1
the 1
modern 1
masters 1
promise 1
very 1
little 1
they 1
know 1
that 1
metals 1
cannot 1
be 1
transmuted 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
chimera 1
but 1
these 1
philosophers 1
whose 1
hands 1
seem 1
only 1
made 1
to 1
dabble 1
in 1
dirt 1
and 1
their 1
eyes 1
to 1
pore 1
over 1
the 1
microscope 1
or 1
crucible 1
have 1
indeed 1
performed 1
miracles 1
they 1
penetrate 1
into 1
the 1
recesses 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
show 1
how 1
she 1
works 1
in 1
her 1
hidingplaces 1
they 1
ascend 1
into 1
the 1
heavens 1
they 1
have 1
discovered 1
how 1
the 1
blood 1
circulates 1
and 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
we 1
breathe 1
they 1
have 1
acquired 1
new 1
and 1
almost 1
unlimited 1
powers 1
they 1
can 1
command 1
the 1
thunders 1
of 1
heaven 1
mimic 1
the 1
earthquake 1
and 1
even 1
mock 1
the 1
invisible 1
world 1

its 1
own 1
shadows 1

i 1
closed 1
not 1
my 1
eyes 1
that 1
night 1
my 1
internal 1
being 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insurrection 1
and 1
turmoil 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
order 1
would 1
thence 1
arise 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
power 1

produce 1

degrees 1
after 1
the 1
mornings 1
dawn 1
sleep 1
came 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
yesternights 1
thoughts 1
were 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
ancient 1
studies 1
and 1
to 1
devote 1
myself 1
to 1
a 1
science 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
to 1
possess 1
a 1
natural 1
talent 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
i 1
paid 1
m 1
waldman 1
a 1
visit 1
his 1
manners 1
in 1
private 1
were 1
even 1
more 1
mild 1
and 1
attractive 1
than 1
in 1
public 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
dignity 1
in 1
his 1
mien 1
during 1
his 1
lecture 1
which 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
was 1
replaced 1
by 1
the 1
greatest 1
affability 1
and 1
kindness 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
pretty 1
nearly 1
the 1
same 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
pursuits 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
fellow 1
professor 1
he 1
heard 1
with 1
attention 1
the 1
little 1
narration 1
concerning 1
my 1
studies 1
and 1
smiled 1
at 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
but 1
without 1
the 1
contempt 1
that 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
exhibited 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
these 1
were 1
men 1
to 1
whose 1
indefatigable 1
zeal 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
were 1
indebted 1
for 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
their 1
knowledge 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
an 1
easier 1
task 1
to 1
give 1
new 1
names 1
and 1
arrange 1
in 1
connected 1
classifications 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
they 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
bringing 1
to 1
light 1
the 1
labours 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
however 1
erroneously 1
directed 1
scarcely 1
ever 1
fail 1
in 1
ultimately 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
solid 1
advantage 1
of 1
mankind 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
statement 1
which 1
was 1
delivered 1
without 1
any 1
presumption 1
or 1
affectation 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
that 1
his 1
lecture 1
had 1
removed 1
my 1
prejudices 1
against 1
modern 1
chemists 1
i 1
expressed 1
myself 1
in 1
measured 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
modesty 1
and 1
deference 1
due 1
from 1
a 1
youth 1
to 1
his 1
instructor 1
without 1
letting 1
escape 1
inexperience 1
in 1
life 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
ashamed 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
stimulated 1
my 1
intended 1
labours 1
i 1
requested 1
his 1
advice 1
concerning 1
the 1
books 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
said 1
m 1
waldman 1
to 1
have 1
gained 1
a 1
disciple 1
and 1
if 1
your 1
application 1
equals 1
your 1
ability 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
your 1
success 1
chemistry 1
is 1
that 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
greatest 1
improvements 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
made 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
it 1
my 1
peculiar 1
study 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
neglected 1
the 1
other 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
a 1
man 1
would 1
make 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
sorry 1
chemist 1
if 1
he 1
attended 1
to 1
that 1
department 1
of 1
human 1
knowledge 1
alone 1
if 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
to 1
become 1
really 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
science 1
and 1
not 1
merely 1
a 1
petty 1
experimentalist 1
i 1
should 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
apply 1
to 1
every 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
including 1
mathematics 1
he 1
then 1
took 1
me 1
into 1
his 1
laboratory 1
and 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
his 1
various 1
machines 1
instructing 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
promising 1
me 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
advanced 1
far 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
science 1
not 1
to 1
derange 1
their 1
mechanism 1
he 1
also 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
books 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
requested 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
leave 1
thus 1
ended 1
a 1
day 1
memorable 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
decided 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
chapter 1
4 1
from 1
this 1
day 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
and 1
particularly 1
chemistry 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
comprehensive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
term 1
became 1
nearly 1
my 1
sole 1
occupation 1
i 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
those 1
works 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
discrimination 1
which 1
modern 1
inquirers 1
have 1
written 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
i 1
attended 1
the 1
lectures 1
and 1
cultivated 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
science 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
even 1
in 1
m 1
krempe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
sound 1
sense 1
and 1
real 1
information 1
combined 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
with 1
a 1
repulsive 1
physiognomy 1
and 1
manners 1
but 1
not 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
the 1
less 1
valuable 1
in 1
m 1
waldman 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
true 1
friend 1
his 1
gentleness 1
was 1
never 1
tinged 1
by 1
dogmatism 1
and 1
his 1
instructions 1
were 1
given 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
frankness 1
and 1
good 1
nature 1
that 1
banished 1
every 1
idea 1
of 1
pedantry 1
in 1
a 1
thousand 1
ways 1
he 1
smoothed 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
abstruse 1
inquiries 1
clear 1
and 1
facile 1
to 1
my 1
apprehension 1
my 1
application 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
fluctuating 1
and 1
uncertain 1
it 1
gained 1
strength 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
and 1
soon 1
became 1
so 1
ardent 1
and 1
eager 1
that 1
the 1
stars 1
often 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
morning 1
whilst 1
i 1
was 1
yet 1
engaged 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
as 1
i 1
applied 1
so 1
closely 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
easily 1
conceived 1
that 1
my 1
progress 1
was 1
rapid 1
my 1
ardour 1
was 1
indeed 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
the 1
students 1
and 1
my 1
proficiency 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
masters 1
professor 1
krempe 1
often 1
asked 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sly 1
smile 1
how 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
went 1
on 1
whilst 1
m 1
waldman 1
expressed 1
the 1
most 1
heartfelt 1
exultation 1
in 1
my 1
progress 1
two 1
years 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
paid 1
no 1
visit 1
to 1
geneva 1
but 1
was 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
which 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
make 1
none 1
but 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
experienced 1
them 1
can 1
conceive 1
of 1
the 1
enticements 1
of 1
science 1
in 1
other 1
studies 1
you 1
go 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
others 1
have 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
know 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
scientific 1
pursuit 1
there 1
is 1
continual 1
food 1
for 1
discovery 1
and 1
wonder 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
moderate 1
capacity 1
which 1
closely 1
pursues 1
one 1
study 1
must 1
infallibly 1
arrive 1
at 1
great 1
proficiency 1
in 1
that 1
study 1
and 1
i 1
who 1
continually 1
sought 1
the 1
attainment 1
of 1
one 1
object 1
of 1
pursuit 1
and 1
was 1
solely 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
this 1
improved 1
so 1
rapidly 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
i 1
made 1
some 1
discoveries 1
in 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
some 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
which 1
procured 1
me 1
great 1
esteem 1
and 1
admiration 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
arrived 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
had 1
become 1
as 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
theory 1
and 1
practice 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
as 1
depended 1
on 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
professors 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
my 1
residence 1
there 1
being 1
no 1
longer 1
conducive 1
to 1
my 1
improvements 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
when 1
an 1
incident 1
happened 1
that 1
protracted 1
my 1
stay 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
phenomena 1
which 1
had 1
peculiarly 1
attracted 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
indeed 1
any 1
animal 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
whence 1
i 1
often 1
asked 1
myself 1
did 1
the 1
principle 1
of 1
life 1
proceed 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bold 1
question 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
mystery 1
yet 1
with 1
how 1
many 1
things 1
are 1
we 1
upon 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
if 1
cowardice 1
or 1
carelessness 1
did 1
not 1
restrain 1
our 1
inquiries 1
i 1
revolved 1
these 1
circumstances 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
determined 1
thenceforth 1
to 1
apply 1
myself 1
more 1
particularly 1
to 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
relate 1
to 1
physiology 1
unless 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
animated 1
by 1
an 1
almost 1
supernatural 1
enthusiasm 1
my 1
application 1
to 1
this 1
study 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
irksome 1
and 1
almost 1
intolerable 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
must 1
first 1
have 1
recourse 1
to 1
death 1
i 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
anatomy 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
sufficient 1
i 1
must 1
also 1
observe 1
the 1
natural 1
decay 1
and 1
corruption 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
body 1
in 1
my 1
education 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
greatest 1
precautions 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
should 1
be 1
impressed 1
with 1
no 1
supernatural 1
horrors 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
ever 1
remember 1
to 1
have 1
trembled 1
at 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
superstition 1
or 1
to 1
have 1
feared 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
a 1
spirit 1
darkness 1
had 1
no 1
effect 1
upon 1
my 1
fancy 1
and 1
a 1
churchyard 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
merely 1
the 1
receptacle 1
of 1
bodies 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
which 1
from 1
being 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
strength 1
had 1
become 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
worm 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
progress 1
of 1
this 1
decay 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
spend 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
in 1
vaults 1
and 1
charnelhouses 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
fixed 1
upon 1
every 1
object 1
the 1
most 1
insupportable 1
to 1
the 1
delicacy 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
feelings 1
i 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
fine 1
form 1
of 1
man 1
was 1
degraded 1
and 1
wasted 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
death 1
succeed 1
to 1
the 1
blooming 1
cheek 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
worm 1
inherited 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
brain 1
i 1
paused 1
examining 1
and 1
analysing 1
all 1
the 1
minutiae 1
of 1
causation 1
as 1
exemplified 1
in 1
the 1
change 1
from 1
life 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
death 1
to 1
life 1
until 1
from 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
darkness 1
a 1
sudden 1
light 1
broke 1
in 1
upon 1
mea 1
light 1
so 1
brilliant 1
and 1
wondrous 1
yet 1
so 1
simple 1
that 1
while 1
i 1
became 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
immensity 1
of 1
the 1
prospect 1
which 1
it 1
illustrated 1
i 1
was 1
surprised 1
that 1
among 1
so 1
many 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
who 1
had 1
directed 1
their 1
inquiries 1
towards 1
the 1
same 1
science 1
that 1
i 1
alone 1
should 1
be 1
reserved 1
to 1
discover 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
secret 1
remember 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
recording 1
the 1
vision 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
the 1
sun 1
does 1
not 1
more 1
certainly 1
shine 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
affirm 1
is 1
true 1
some 1
miracle 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
stages 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
were 1
distinct 1
and 1
probable 1
after 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
incredible 1
labour 1
and 1
fatigue 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
discovering 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
generation 1
and 1
life 1
nay 1
more 1
i 1
became 1
myself 1
capable 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
the 1
astonishment 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
experienced 1
on 1
this 1
discovery 1
soon 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
delight 1
and 1
rapture 1
after 1
so 1
much 1
time 1
spent 1
in 1
painful 1
labour 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
my 1
desires 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
gratifying 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
but 1
this 1
discovery 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
progressively 1
led 1
to 1
it 1
were 1
obliterated 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
only 1
the 1
result 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
study 1
and 1
desire 1
of 1
the 1
wisest 1
men 1
since 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
now 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
not 1
that 1
like 1
a 1
magic 1
scene 1
it 1
all 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
information 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
rather 1
to 1
direct 1
my 1
endeavours 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
point 1
them 1
towards 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
search 1
than 1
to 1
exhibit 1
that 1
object 1
already 1
accomplished 1
i 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
arabian 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
with 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
passage 1
to 1
life 1
aided 1
only 1
by 1
one 1
glimmering 1
and 1
seemingly 1
ineffectual 1
light 1
i 1
see 1
by 1
your 1
eagerness 1
and 1
the 1
wonder 1
and 1
hope 1
which 1
your 1
eyes 1
express 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
you 1
expect 1
to 1
be 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
secret 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
acquainted 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
listen 1
patiently 1
until 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
easily 1
perceive 1
why 1
i 1
am 1
reserved 1
upon 1
that 1
subject 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
lead 1
you 1
on 1
unguarded 1
and 1
ardent 1
as 1
i 1
then 1
was 1
to 1
your 1
destruction 1
and 1
infallible 1
misery 1
learn 1
from 1
me 1
if 1
not 1
by 1
my 1
precepts 1
at 1
least 1
by 1
my 1
example 1
how 1
dangerous 1
is 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
happier 1
that 1
man 1
is 1
who 1
believes 1
his 1
native 1
town 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
world 1
than 1
he 1
who 1
aspires 1
to 1
become 1
greater 1
than 1
his 1
nature 1
will 1
allow 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
power 1
placed 1
within 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
hesitated 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
concerning 1
the 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
employ 1
it 1
although 1
i 1
possessed 1
the 1
capacity 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
yet 1
to 1
prepare 1
a 1
frame 1
for 1
the 1
reception 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
intricacies 1
of 1
fibres 1
muscles 1
and 1
veins 1
still 1
remained 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
inconceivable 1
difficulty 1
and 1
labour 1
i 1
doubted 1
at 1
first 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
attempt 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
being 1
like 1
myself 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
simpler 1
organization 1
but 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
exalted 1
by 1
my 1
first 1
success 1
to 1
permit 1
me 1
to 1
doubt 1
of 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
give 1
life 1
to 1
an 1
animal 1
as 1
complex 1
and 1
wonderful 1
as 1
man 1
the 1
materials 1
at 1
present 1
within 1
my 1
command 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
adequate 1
to 1
so 1
arduous 1
an 1
undertaking 1
but 1
i 1
doubted 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
ultimately 1
succeed 1
i 1
prepared 1
myself 1
for 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
reverses 1
my 1
operations 1
might 1
be 1
incessantly 1
baffled 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
work 1
be 1
imperfect 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
considered 1
the 1
improvement 1
which 1
every 1
day 1
takes 1
place 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
mechanics 1
i 1
was 1
encouraged 1
to 1
hope 1
my 1
present 1
attempts 1
would 1
at 1
least 1
lay 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
future 1
success 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
consider 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
complexity 1
of 1
my 1
plan 1
as 1
any 1
argument 1
of 1
its 1
impracticability 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
these 1
feelings 1
that 1
i 1
began 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
as 1
the 1
minuteness 1
of 1
the 1
parts 1
formed 1
a 1
great 1
hindrance 1
to 1
my 1
speed 1
i 1
resolved 1
contrary 1
to 1
my 1
first 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
being 1
of 1
a 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
eight 1
feet 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportionably 1
large 1
after 1
having 1
formed 1
this 1
determination 1
and 1
having 1
spent 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
successfully 1
collecting 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
materials 1
i 1
began 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
variety 1
of 1
feelings 1
which 1
bore 1
me 1
onwards 1
like 1
a 1
hurricane 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
ideal 1
bounds 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
first 1
break 1
through 1
and 1
pour 1
a 1
torrent 1
of 1
light 1
into 1
our 1
dark 1
world 1
a 1
new 1
species 1
would 1
bless 1
me 1
as 1
its 1
creator 1
and 1
source 1
many 1
happy 1
and 1
excellent 1
natures 1
would 1
owe 1
their 1
being 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
father 1
could 1
claim 1
the 1
gratitude 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
so 1
completely 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
deserve 1
theirs 1
pursuing 1
these 1
reflections 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
bestow 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
i 1
might 1
in 1
process 1
of 1
time 1
although 1
i 1
now 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
renew 1
life 1
where 1
death 1
had 1
apparently 1
devoted 1
the 1
body 1
to 1
corruption 1
these 1
thoughts 1
supported 1
my 1
spirits 1
while 1
i 1
pursued 1
my 1
undertaking 1
with 1
unremitting 1
ardour 1
my 1
cheek 1
had 1
grown 1
pale 1
with 1
study 1
and 1
my 1
person 1
had 1
become 1
emaciated 1
with 1
confinement 1
sometimes 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
brink 1
of 1
certainty 1
i 1
failed 1
yet 1
still 1
i 1
clung 1
to 1
the 1
hope 1
which 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
hour 1
might 1
realize 1
one 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
alone 1
possessed 1
was 1
the 1
hope 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
midnight 1
labours 1
while 1
with 1
unrelaxed 1
and 1
breathless 1
eagerness 1
i 1
pursued 1
nature 1
to 1
her 1
hidingplaces 1
who 1
shall 1
conceive 1
the 1
horrors 1
of 1
my 1
secret 1
toil 1
as 1
i 1
dabbled 1
among 1
the 1
unhallowed 1
damps 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
or 1
tortured 1
the 1
living 1
animal 1
to 1
animate 1
the 1
lifeless 1
clay 1
my 1
limbs 1
now 1
tremble 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
swim 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
but 1
then 1
a 1
resistless 1
and 1
almost 1
frantic 1
impulse 1
urged 1
me 1
forward 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
all 1
soul 1
or 1
sensation 1
but 1
for 1
this 1
one 1
pursuit 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
but 1
a 1
passing 1
trance 1
that 1
only 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
with 1
renewed 1
acuteness 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
unnatural 1
stimulus 1
ceasing 1
to 1
operate 1
i 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
habits 1
i 1
collected 1
bones 1
from 1
charnelhouses 1
and 1
disturbed 1
with 1
profane 1
fingers 1
the 1
tremendous 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
in 1
a 1
solitary 1
chamber 1
or 1
rather 1
cell 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
apartments 1
by 1
a 1
gallery 1
and 1
staircase 1
i 1
kept 1
my 1
workshop 1
of 1
filthy 1
creation 1
my 1
eyeballs 1
were 1
starting 1
from 1
their 1
sockets 1
in 1
attending 1
to 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
the 1
dissecting 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
slaughterhouse 1
furnished 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
materials 1
and 1
often 1
did 1
my 1
human 1
nature 1
turn 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
my 1
occupation 1
whilst 1
still 1
urged 1
on 1
by 1
an 1
eagerness 1
which 1
perpetually 1
increased 1
i 1
brought 1
my 1
work 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
conclusion 1
the 1
summer 1
months 1
passed 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
one 1
pursuit 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
beautiful 1
season 1
never 1
did 1
the 1
fields 1
bestow 1
a 1
more 1
plentiful 1
harvest 1
or 1
the 1
vines 1
yield 1
a 1
more 1
luxuriant 1
vintage 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
insensible 1
to 1
the 1
charms 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
neglect 1
the 1
scenes 1
around 1
me 1
caused 1
me 1
also 1
to 1
forget 1
those 1
friends 1
who 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
miles 1
absent 1
and 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
knew 1
my 1
silence 1
disquieted 1
them 1
and 1
i 1
well 1
remembered 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
pleased 1
with 1
yourself 1
you 1
will 1
think 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
affection 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
hear 1
regularly 1
from 1
you 1
you 1
must 1
pardon 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
regard 1
any 1
interruption 1
in 1
your 1
correspondence 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
that 1
your 1
other 1
duties 1
are 1
equally 1
neglected 1
i 1
knew 1
well 1
therefore 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
fathers 1
feelings 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
my 1
thoughts 1
from 1
my 1
employment 1
loathsome 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
which 1
had 1
taken 1
an 1
irresistible 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
i 1
wished 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
procrastinate 1
all 1
that 1
related 1
to 1
my 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
until 1
the 1
great 1
object 1
which 1
swallowed 1
up 1
every 1
habit 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
should 1
be 1
completed 1
i 1
then 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
would 1
be 1
unjust 1
if 1
he 1
ascribed 1
my 1
neglect 1
to 1
vice 1
or 1
faultiness 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
justified 1
in 1
conceiving 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
altogether 1
free 1
from 1
blame 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
in 1
perfection 1
ought 1
always 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
calm 1
and 1
peaceful 1
mind 1
and 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
passion 1
or 1
a 1
transitory 1
desire 1
to 1
disturb 1
his 1
tranquillity 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
knowledge 1
is 1
an 1
exception 1
to 1
this 1
rule 1
if 1
the 1
study 1
to 1
which 1
you 1
apply 1
yourself 1
has 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
weaken 1
your 1
affections 1
and 1
to 1
destroy 1
your 1
taste 1
for 1
those 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
in 1
which 1
no 1
alloy 1
can 1
possibly 1
mix 1
then 1
that 1
study 1
is 1
certainly 1
unlawful 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
not 1
befitting 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
if 1
this 1
rule 1
were 1
always 1
observed 1
if 1
no 1
man 1
allowed 1
any 1
pursuit 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
his 1
domestic 1
affections 1
greece 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
enslaved 1
caesar 1
would 1
have 1
spared 1
his 1
country 1
america 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
discovered 1
more 1
gradually 1
and 1
the 1
empires 1
of 1
mexico 1
and 1
peru 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
destroyed 1
but 1
i 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
moralizing 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1
and 1
your 1
looks 1
remind 1
me 1
to 1
proceed 1
my 1
father 1
made 1
no 1
reproach 1
in 1
his 1
letters 1
and 1
only 1
took 1
notice 1
of 1
my 1
silence 1
by 1
inquiring 1
into 1
my 1
occupations 1
more 1
particularly 1
than 1
before 1
winter 1
spring 1
and 1
summer 1
passed 1
away 1
during 1
my 1
labours 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
watch 1
the 1
blossom 1
or 1
the 1
expanding 1
leavessights 1
which 1
before 1
always 1
yielded 1
me 1
supreme 1
delightso 1
deeply 1
was 1
i 1
engrossed 1
in 1
my 1
occupation 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
that 1
year 1
had 1
withered 1
before 1
my 1
work 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
now 1
every 1
day 1
showed 1
me 1
more 1
plainly 1
how 1
well 1
i 1
had 1
succeeded 1
but 1
my 1
enthusiasm 1
was 1
checked 1
by 1
my 1
anxiety 1
and 1
i 1
appeared 1
rather 1
like 1
one 1
doomed 1
by 1
slavery 1
to 1
toil 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
unwholesome 1
trade 1
than 1
an 1
artist 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
favourite 1
employment 1
every 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
a 1
slow 1
fever 1
and 1
i 1
became 1
nervous 1
to 1
a 1
most 1
painful 1
degree 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
a 1
leaf 1
startled 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
shunned 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
guilty 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
sometimes 1
i 1
grew 1
alarmed 1
at 1
the 1
wreck 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
become 1
the 1
energy 1
of 1
my 1
purpose 1
alone 1
sustained 1
me 1
my 1
labours 1
would 1
soon 1
end 1
and 1
i 1
believed 1
that 1
exercise 1
and 1
amusement 1
would 1
then 1
drive 1
away 1
incipient 1
disease 1
and 1
i 1
promised 1
myself 1
both 1
of 1
these 1
when 1
my 1
creation 1
should 1
be 1
complete 1
chapter 1
5 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
dreary 1
night 1
of 1
november 1
that 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
accomplishment 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
with 1
an 1
anxiety 1
that 1
almost 1
amounted 1
to 1
agony 1
i 1
collected 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
life 1
around 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
infuse 1
a 1
spark 1
of 1
being 1
into 1
the 1
lifeless 1
thing 1
that 1
lay 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
rain 1
pattered 1
dismally 1
against 1
the 1
panes 1
and 1
my 1
candle 1
was 1
nearly 1
burnt 1
out 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
the 1
halfextinguished 1
light 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dull 1
yellow 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
open 1
it 1
breathed 1
hard 1
and 1
a 1
convulsive 1
motion 1
agitated 1
its 1
limbs 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
describe 1
my 1
emotions 1
at 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
or 1
how 1
delineate 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
with 1
such 1
infinite 1
pains 1
and 1
care 1
i 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
form 1
his 1
limbs 1
were 1
in 1
proportion 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
selected 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
beautiful 1
beautiful 1
great 1
god 1
his 1
yellow 1
skin 1
scarcely 1
covered 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
muscles 1
and 1
arteries 1
beneath 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
lustrous 1
black 1
and 1
flowing 1
his 1
teeth 1
of 1
a 1
pearly 1
whiteness 1
but 1
these 1
luxuriances 1
only 1
formed 1
a 1
more 1
horrid 1
contrast 1
with 1
his 1
watery 1
eyes 1
that 1
seemed 1
almost 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
colour 1
as 1
the 1
dunwhite 1
sockets 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
set 1
his 1
shrivelled 1
complexion 1
and 1
straight 1
black 1
lips 1
the 1
different 1
accidents 1
of 1
life 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
changeable 1
as 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
i 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
for 1
the 1
sole 1
purpose 1
of 1
infusing 1
life 1
into 1
an 1
inanimate 1
body 1
for 1
this 1
i 1
had 1
deprived 1
myself 1
of 1
rest 1
and 1
health 1
i 1
had 1
desired 1
it 1
with 1
an 1
ardour 1
that 1
far 1
exceeded 1
moderation 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
dream 1
vanished 1
and 1
breathless 1
horror 1
and 1
disgust 1
filled 1
my 1
heart 1
unable 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
continued 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
traversing 1
my 1
bedchamber 1
unable 1
to 1
compose 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
sleep 1
at 1
length 1
lassitude 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
tumult 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
endured 1
and 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
my 1
clothes 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
of 1
forgetfulness 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
i 1
slept 1
indeed 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
dreams 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
saw 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
walking 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
delighted 1
and 1
surprised 1
i 1
embraced 1
her 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
imprinted 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
they 1
became 1
livid 1
with 1
the 1
hue 1
of 1
death 1
her 1
features 1
appeared 1
to 1
change 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
held 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
dead 1
mother 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
a 1
shroud 1
enveloped 1
her 1
form 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
graveworms 1
crawling 1
in 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
the 1
flannel 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
my 1
sleep 1
with 1
horror 1
a 1
cold 1
dew 1
covered 1
my 1
forehead 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
every 1
limb 1
became 1
convulsed 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
dim 1
and 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
as 1
it 1
forced 1
its 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
shutters 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
wretchthe 1
miserable 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
curtain 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
if 1
eyes 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
were 1
fixed 1
on 1
me 1
his 1
jaws 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
some 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
while 1
a 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
cheeks 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
spoken 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
one 1
hand 1
was 1
stretched 1
out 1
seemingly 1
to 1
detain 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
escaped 1
and 1
rushed 1
downstairs 1
i 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
i 1
inhabited 1
where 1
i 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
agitation 1
listening 1
attentively 1
catching 1
and 1
fearing 1
each 1
sound 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
announce 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
the 1
demoniacal 1
corpse 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
miserably 1
given 1
life 1
oh 1
no 1
mortal 1
could 1
support 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
that 1
countenance 1
a 1
mummy 1
again 1
endued 1
with 1
animation 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
hideous 1
as 1
that 1
wretch 1
i 1
had 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
while 1
unfinished 1
he 1
was 1
ugly 1
then 1
but 1
when 1
those 1
muscles 1
and 1
joints 1
were 1
rendered 1
capable 1
of 1
motion 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
thing 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
dante 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
conceived 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
wretchedly 1
sometimes 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
so 1
quickly 1
and 1
hardly 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
palpitation 1
of 1
every 1
artery 1
at 1
others 1
i 1
nearly 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
through 1
languor 1
and 1
extreme 1
weakness 1
mingled 1
with 1
this 1
horror 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
disappointment 1
dreams 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
food 1
and 1
pleasant 1
rest 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
space 1
were 1
now 1
become 1
a 1
hell 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
was 1
so 1
rapid 1
the 1
overthrow 1
so 1
complete 1
morning 1
dismal 1
and 1
wet 1
at 1
length 1
dawned 1
and 1
discovered 1
to 1
my 1
sleepless 1
and 1
aching 1
eyes 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
its 1
white 1
steeple 1
and 1
clock 1
which 1
indicated 1
the 1
sixth 1
hour 1
the 1
porter 1
opened 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
which 1
had 1
that 1
night 1
been 1
my 1
asylum 1
and 1
i 1
issued 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
pacing 1
them 1
with 1
quick 1
steps 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
sought 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
feared 1
every 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
would 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
view 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
apartment 1
which 1
i 1
inhabited 1
but 1
felt 1
impelled 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
although 1
drenched 1
by 1
the 1
rain 1
which 1
poured 1
from 1
a 1
black 1
and 1
comfortless 1
sky 1
i 1
continued 1
walking 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
endeavouring 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
to 1
ease 1
the 1
load 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
traversed 1
the 1
streets 1
without 1
any 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
my 1
heart 1
palpitated 1
in 1
the 1
sickness 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
i 1
hurried 1
on 1
with 1
irregular 1
steps 1
not 1
daring 1
to 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
on 1
a 1
lonely 1
road 1
doth 1
walk 1
in 1
fear 1
and 1
dread 1
and 1
having 1
once 1
turned 1
round 1
walks 1
on 1
and 1
turns 1
no 1
more 1
his 1
head 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
a 1
frightful 1
fiend 1
doth 1
close 1
behind 1
him 1
tread 1
coleridges 1
ancient 1
mariner 1
continuing 1
thus 1
i 1
came 1
at 1
length 1
opposite 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
various 1
diligences 1
and 1
carriages 1
usually 1
stopped 1
here 1
i 1
paused 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
why 1
but 1
i 1
remained 1
some 1
minutes 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
coach 1
that 1
was 1
coming 1
towards 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
as 1
it 1
drew 1
nearer 1
i 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
swiss 1
diligence 1
it 1
stopped 1
just 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
standing 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
being 1
opened 1
i 1
perceived 1
henry 1
clerval 1
who 1
on 1
seeing 1
me 1
instantly 1
sprung 1
out 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
he 1
how 1
glad 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
how 1
fortunate 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
of 1
my 1
alighting 1
nothing 1
could 1
equal 1
my 1
delight 1
on 1
seeing 1
clerval 1
his 1
presence 1
brought 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
my 1
father 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
scenes 1
of 1
home 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
i 1
grasped 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
forgot 1
my 1
horror 1
and 1
misfortune 1
i 1
felt 1
suddenly 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
calm 1
and 1
serene 1
joy 1
i 1
welcomed 1
my 1
friend 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
cordial 1
manner 1
and 1
we 1
walked 1
towards 1
my 1
college 1
clerval 1
continued 1
talking 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
about 1
our 1
mutual 1
friends 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
good 1
fortune 1
in 1
being 1
permitted 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
believe 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
difficulty 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
all 1
necessary 1
knowledge 1
was 1
not 1
comprised 1
in 1
the 1
noble 1
art 1
of 1
bookkeeping 1
and 1
indeed 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
left 1
him 1
incredulous 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
for 1
his 1
constant 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
unwearied 1
entreaties 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
dutch 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
the 1
vicar 1
of 1
wakefield 1
i 1
have 1
ten 1
thousand 1
florins 1
a 1
year 1
without 1
greek 1
i 1
eat 1
heartily 1
without 1
greek 1
but 1
his 1
affection 1
for 1
me 1
at 1
length 1
overcame 1
his 1
dislike 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
permitted 1
me 1
to 1
undertake 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
knowledge 1
it 1
gives 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
you 1
left 1
my 1
father 1
brothers 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
very 1
happy 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
uneasy 1
that 1
they 1
hear 1
from 1
you 1
so 1
seldom 1
by 1
the 1
by 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
lecture 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
upon 1
their 1
account 1
myself 1
but 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
continued 1
he 1
stopping 1
short 1
and 1
gazing 1
full 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
before 1
remark 1
how 1
very 1
ill 1
you 1
appear 1
so 1
thin 1
and 1
pale 1
you 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
for 1
several 1
nights 1
you 1
have 1
guessed 1
right 1
i 1
have 1
lately 1
been 1
so 1
deeply 1
engaged 1
in 1
one 1
occupation 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
allowed 1
myself 1
sufficient 1
rest 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
i 1
hope 1
i 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
all 1
these 1
employments 1
are 1
now 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
length 1
free 1
i 1
trembled 1
excessively 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
far 1
less 1
to 1
allude 1
to 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
i 1
walked 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
pace 1
and 1
we 1
soon 1
arrived 1
at 1
my 1
college 1
i 1
then 1
reflected 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
made 1
me 1
shiver 1
that 1
the 1
creature 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
in 1
my 1
apartment 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
there 1
alive 1
and 1
walking 1
about 1
i 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
this 1
monster 1
but 1
i 1
feared 1
still 1
more 1
that 1
henry 1
should 1
see 1
him 1
entreating 1
him 1
therefore 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
i 1
darted 1
up 1
towards 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
my 1
hand 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
i 1
recollected 1
myself 1
i 1
then 1
paused 1
and 1
a 1
cold 1
shivering 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
threw 1
the 1
door 1
forcibly 1
open 1
as 1
children 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
they 1
expect 1
a 1
spectre 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
but 1
nothing 1
appeared 1
i 1
stepped 1
fearfully 1
in 1
the 1
apartment 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
my 1
bedroom 1
was 1
also 1
freed 1
from 1
its 1
hideous 1
guest 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
that 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
good 1
fortune 1
could 1
have 1
befallen 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
became 1
assured 1
that 1
my 1
enemy 1
had 1
indeed 1
fled 1
i 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
to 1
clerval 1
we 1
ascended 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
servant 1
presently 1
brought 1
breakfast 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
contain 1
myself 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
joy 1
only 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
my 1
flesh 1
tingle 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
sensitiveness 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
rapidly 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
remain 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
instant 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
i 1
jumped 1
over 1
the 1
chairs 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
laughed 1
aloud 1
clerval 1
at 1
first 1
attributed 1
my 1
unusual 1
spirits 1
to 1
joy 1
on 1
his 1
arrival 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
observed 1
me 1
more 1
attentively 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
wildness 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
and 1
my 1
loud 1
unrestrained 1
heartless 1
laughter 1
frightened 1
and 1
astonished 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
for 1
gods 1
sake 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
do 1
not 1
laugh 1
in 1
that 1
manner 1
how 1
ill 1
you 1
are 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
do 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
cried 1
i 1
putting 1
my 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dreaded 1
spectre 1
glide 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
can 1
tell 1
oh 1
save 1
me 1
save 1
me 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
seized 1
me 1
i 1
struggled 1
furiously 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
poor 1
clerval 1
what 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
feelings 1
a 1
meeting 1
which 1
he 1
anticipated 1
with 1
such 1
joy 1
so 1
strangely 1
turned 1
to 1
bitterness 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
witness 1
of 1
his 1
grief 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
lifeless 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
recover 1
my 1
senses 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
long 1
time 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
a 1
nervous 1
fever 1
which 1
confined 1
me 1
for 1
several 1
months 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
henry 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
nurse 1
i 1
afterwards 1
learned 1
that 1
knowing 1
my 1
fathers 1
advanced 1
age 1
and 1
unfitness 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
how 1
wretched 1
my 1
sickness 1
would 1
make 1
elizabeth 1
he 1
spared 1
them 1
this 1
grief 1
by 1
concealing 1
the 1
extent 1
of 1
my 1
disorder 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
more 1
kind 1
and 1
attentive 1
nurse 1
than 1
himself 1
and 1
firm 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
he 1
felt 1
of 1
my 1
recovery 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
doing 1
harm 1
he 1
performed 1
the 1
kindest 1
action 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
towards 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
surely 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
unbounded 1
and 1
unremitting 1
attentions 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
bestowed 1
existence 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
raved 1
incessantly 1
concerning 1
him 1
doubtless 1
my 1
words 1
surprised 1
henry 1
he 1
at 1
first 1
believed 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
wanderings 1
of 1
my 1
disturbed 1
imagination 1
but 1
the 1
pertinacity 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
continually 1
recurred 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
subject 1
persuaded 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
disorder 1
indeed 1
owed 1
its 1
origin 1
to 1
some 1
uncommon 1
and 1
terrible 1
event 1
by 1
very 1
slow 1
degrees 1
and 1
with 1
frequent 1
relapses 1
that 1
alarmed 1
and 1
grieved 1
my 1
friend 1
i 1
recovered 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
became 1
capable 1
of 1
observing 1
outward 1
objects 1
with 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
pleasure 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
fallen 1
leaves 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
buds 1
were 1
shooting 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
my 1
window 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
divine 1
spring 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
my 1
convalescence 1
i 1
felt 1
also 1
sentiments 1
of 1
joy 1
and 1
affection 1
revive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
my 1
gloom 1
disappeared 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
i 1
became 1
as 1
cheerful 1
as 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
attacked 1
by 1
the 1
fatal 1
passion 1
dearest 1
clerval 1
exclaimed 1
i 1
how 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
good 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
whole 1
winter 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
spent 1
in 1
study 1
as 1
you 1
promised 1
yourself 1
has 1
been 1
consumed 1
in 1
my 1
sick 1
room 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
ever 1
repay 1
you 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
greatest 1
remorse 1
for 1
the 1
disappointment 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
occasion 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
forgive 1
me 1
you 1
will 1
repay 1
me 1
entirely 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
discompose 1
yourself 1
but 1
get 1
well 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
appear 1
in 1
such 1
good 1
spirits 1
i 1
may 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
one 1
subject 1
may 1
i 1
not 1
i 1
trembled 1
one 1
subject 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
could 1
he 1
allude 1
to 1
an 1
object 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
even 1
think 1
compose 1
yourself 1
said 1
clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
colour 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
mention 1
it 1
if 1
it 1
agitates 1
you 1
but 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
cousin 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
if 1
they 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
they 1
hardly 1
know 1
how 1
ill 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
are 1
uneasy 1
at 1
your 1
long 1
silence 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
henry 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
suppose 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
would 1
not 1
fly 1
towards 1
those 1
dear 1
dear 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
love 1
and 1
who 1
are 1
so 1
deserving 1
of 1
my 1
love 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
present 1
temper 1
my 1
friend 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
lying 1
here 1
some 1
days 1
for 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
from 1
your 1
cousin 1
i 1
believe 1
chapter 1
6 1
clerval 1
then 1
put 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
dearest 1
cousin 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
ill 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
constant 1
letters 1
of 1
dear 1
kind 1
henry 1
are 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
reassure 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
account 1
you 1
are 1
forbidden 1
to 1
writeto 1
hold 1
a 1
pen 1
yet 1
one 1
word 1
from 1
you 1
dear 1
victor 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
calm 1
our 1
apprehensions 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
each 1
post 1
would 1
bring 1
this 1
line 1
and 1
my 1
persuasions 1
have 1
restrained 1
my 1
uncle 1
from 1
undertaking 1
a 1
journey 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
have 1
prevented 1
his 1
encountering 1
the 1
inconveniences 1
and 1
perhaps 1
dangers 1
of 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
yet 1
how 1
often 1
have 1
i 1
regretted 1
not 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
perform 1
it 1
myself 1
i 1
figure 1
to 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
attending 1
on 1
your 1
sickbed 1
has 1
devolved 1
on 1
some 1
mercenary 1
old 1
nurse 1
who 1
could 1
never 1
guess 1
your 1
wishes 1
nor 1
minister 1
to 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
care 1
and 1
affection 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
cousin 1
yet 1
that 1
is 1
over 1
now 1
clerval 1
writes 1
that 1
indeed 1
you 1
are 1
getting 1
better 1
i 1
eagerly 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
confirm 1
this 1
intelligence 1
soon 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
get 1
welland 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
happy 1
cheerful 1
home 1
and 1
friends 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
dearly 1
your 1
fathers 1
health 1
is 1
vigorous 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
but 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
care 1
will 1
ever 1
cloud 1
his 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
how 1
pleased 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
remark 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
our 1
ernest 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
sixteen 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
activity 1
and 1
spirit 1
he 1
is 1
desirous 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
true 1
swiss 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
foreign 1
service 1
but 1
we 1
cannot 1
part 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
returns 1
to 1
us 1
my 1
uncle 1
is 1
not 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
military 1
career 1
in 1
a 1
distant 1
country 1
but 1
ernest 1
never 1
had 1
your 1
powers 1
of 1
application 1
he 1
looks 1
upon 1
study 1
as 1
an 1
odious 1
fetter 1
his 1
time 1
is 1
spent 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
climbing 1
the 1
hills 1
or 1
rowing 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
become 1
an 1
idler 1
unless 1
we 1
yield 1
the 1
point 1
and 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
profession 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
selected 1
little 1
alteration 1
except 1
the 1
growth 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
children 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
the 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
snowclad 1
mountainsthey 1
never 1
change 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
our 1
placid 1
home 1
and 1
our 1
contented 1
hearts 1
are 1
regulated 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
immutable 1
laws 1
my 1
trifling 1
occupations 1
take 1
up 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
amuse 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
rewarded 1
for 1
any 1
exertions 1
by 1
seeing 1
none 1
but 1
happy 1
kind 1
faces 1
around 1
me 1
since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
but 1
one 1
change 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
our 1
little 1
household 1
do 1
you 1
remember 1
on 1
what 1
occasion 1
justine 1
moritz 1
entered 1
our 1
family 1
probably 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
i 1
will 1
relate 1
her 1
history 1
therefore 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
madame 1
moritz 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
widow 1
with 1
four 1
children 1
of 1
whom 1
justine 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
this 1
girl 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
through 1
a 1
strange 1
perversity 1
her 1
mother 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
her 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
m 1
moritz 1
treated 1
her 1
very 1
ill 1
my 1
aunt 1
observed 1
this 1
and 1
when 1
justine 1
was 1
twelve 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
allow 1
her 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
our 1
house 1
the 1
republican 1
institutions 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
have 1
produced 1
simpler 1
and 1
happier 1
manners 1
than 1
those 1
which 1
prevail 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
monarchies 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
hence 1
there 1
is 1
less 1
distinction 1
between 1
the 1
several 1
classes 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
being 1
neither 1
so 1
poor 1
nor 1
so 1
despised 1
their 1
manners 1
are 1
more 1
refined 1
and 1
moral 1
a 1
servant 1
in 1
geneva 1
does 1
not 1
mean 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
servant 1
in 1
france 1
and 1
england 1
justine 1
thus 1
received 1
in 1
our 1
family 1
learned 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
servant 1
a 1
condition 1
which 1
in 1
our 1
fortunate 1
country 1
does 1
not 1
include 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
ignorance 1
and 1
a 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
justine 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
favourite 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
i 1
recollect 1
you 1
once 1
remarked 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
in 1
an 1
ill 1
humour 1
one 1
glance 1
from 1
justine 1
could 1
dissipate 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
ariosto 1
gives 1
concerning 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
angelicashe 1
looked 1
so 1
frankhearted 1
and 1
happy 1
my 1
aunt 1
conceived 1
a 1
great 1
attachment 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
induced 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
an 1
education 1
superior 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
intended 1
this 1
benefit 1
was 1
fully 1
repaid 1
justine 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
grateful 1
little 1
creature 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
she 1
made 1
any 1
professions 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
one 1
pass 1
her 1
lips 1
but 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
she 1
almost 1
adored 1
her 1
protectress 1
although 1
her 1
disposition 1
was 1
gay 1
and 1
in 1
many 1
respects 1
inconsiderate 1
yet 1
she 1
paid 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
to 1
every 1
gesture 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
she 1
thought 1
her 1
the 1
model 1
of 1
all 1
excellence 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
imitate 1
her 1
phraseology 1
and 1
manners 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
she 1
often 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
when 1
my 1
dearest 1
aunt 1
died 1
every 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
occupied 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
grief 1
to 1
notice 1
poor 1
justine 1
who 1
had 1
attended 1
her 1
during 1
her 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
anxious 1
affection 1
poor 1
justine 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
but 1
other 1
trials 1
were 1
reserved 1
for 1
her 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
died 1
and 1
her 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
her 1
neglected 1
daughter 1
was 1
left 1
childless 1
the 1
conscience 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
troubled 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
favourites 1
was 1
a 1
judgement 1
from 1
heaven 1
to 1
chastise 1
her 1
partiality 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
roman 1
catholic 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
her 1
confessor 1
confirmed 1
the 1
idea 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
conceived 1
accordingly 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
after 1
your 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
justine 1
was 1
called 1
home 1
by 1
her 1
repentant 1
mother 1
poor 1
girl 1
she 1
wept 1
when 1
she 1
quitted 1
our 1
house 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
altered 1
since 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
grief 1
had 1
given 1
softness 1
and 1
a 1
winning 1
mildness 1
to 1
her 1
manners 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
remarkable 1
for 1
vivacity 1
nor 1
was 1
her 1
residence 1
at 1
her 1
mothers 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
to 1
restore 1
her 1
gaiety 1
the 1
poor 1
woman 1
was 1
very 1
vacillating 1
in 1
her 1
repentance 1
she 1
sometimes 1
begged 1
justine 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
unkindness 1
but 1
much 1
oftener 1
accused 1
her 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
perpetual 1
fretting 1
at 1
length 1
threw 1
madame 1
moritz 1
into 1
a 1
decline 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
increased 1
her 1
irritability 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
at 1
peace 1
for 1
ever 1
she 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
approach 1
of 1
cold 1
weather 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
this 1
last 1
winter 1
justine 1
has 1
just 1
returned 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
i 1
love 1
her 1
tenderly 1
she 1
is 1
very 1
clever 1
and 1
gentle 1
and 1
extremely 1
pretty 1
as 1
i 1
mentioned 1
before 1
her 1
mien 1
and 1
her 1
expression 1
continually 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
dear 1
aunt 1

must 1
say 1
also 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
to 1

very 1
tall 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
with 1
sweet 1
laughing 1
blue 1
eyes 1
dark 1
eyelashes 1
and 1
curling 1
hair 1
when 1
he 1
smiles 1
two 1
little 1
dimples 1
appear 1
on 1
each 1
cheek 1
which 1
are 1
rosy 1
with 1
health 1

has 1
already 1
had 1
one 1

dear 1
dear 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
her 1
letter 1
i 1
will 1
write 1
instantly 1
and 1
relieve 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
anxiety 1
they 1
must 1
feel 1
i 1
wrote 1
and 1
this 1
exertion 1
greatly 1
fatigued 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
convalescence 1
had 1
commenced 1
and 1
proceeded 1
regularly 1
in 1
another 1
fortnight 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
chamber 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
duties 1
on 1
my 1
recovery 1
was 1
to 1
introduce 1
clerval 1
to 1
the 1
several 1
professors 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
i 1
underwent 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
rough 1
usage 1
ill 1
befitting 1
the 1
wounds 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
had 1
sustained 1
ever 1
since 1
the 1
fatal 1
night 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
violent 1
antipathy 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
otherwise 1
quite 1
restored 1
to 1
health 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
chemical 1
instrument 1
would 1
renew 1
all 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
nervous 1
symptoms 1
henry 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
had 1
removed 1
all 1
my 1
apparatus 1
from 1
my 1
view 1
he 1
had 1
also 1
changed 1
my 1
apartment 1
for 1
he 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
dislike 1
for 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
previously 1
been 1
my 1
laboratory 1
but 1
these 1
cares 1
of 1
clerval 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
when 1
i 1
visited 1
the 1
professors 1
m 1
waldman 1
inflicted 1
torture 1
when 1
he 1
praised 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
warmth 1
the 1
astonishing 1
progress 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
sciences 1
he 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
disliked 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
not 1
guessing 1
the 1
real 1
cause 1
he 1
attributed 1
my 1
feelings 1
to 1
modesty 1
and 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
from 1
my 1
improvement 1
to 1
the 1
science 1
itself 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
as 1
i 1
evidently 1
saw 1
of 1
drawing 1
me 1
out 1
what 1
could 1
i 1
do 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
please 1
and 1
he 1
tormented 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
carefully 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
in 1
my 1
view 1
those 1
instruments 1
which 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
afterwards 1
used 1
in 1
putting 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
and 1
cruel 1
death 1
i 1
writhed 1
under 1
his 1
words 1
yet 1
dared 1
not 1
exhibit 1
the 1
pain 1
i 1
felt 1
clerval 1
whose 1
eyes 1
and 1
feelings 1
were 1
always 1
quick 1
in 1
discerning 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
others 1
declined 1
the 1
subject 1
alleging 1
in 1
excuse 1
his 1
total 1
ignorance 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
took 1
a 1
more 1
general 1
turn 1
i 1
thanked 1
my 1
friend 1
from 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
i 1
saw 1
plainly 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
surprised 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
attempted 1
to 1
draw 1
my 1
secret 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
loved 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
reverence 1
that 1
knew 1
no 1
bounds 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
persuade 1
myself 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
event 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
often 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
detail 1
to 1
another 1
would 1
only 1
impress 1
more 1
deeply 1
m 1
krempe 1
was 1
not 1
equally 1
docile 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
condition 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
of 1
almost 1
insupportable 1
sensitiveness 1
his 1
harsh 1
blunt 1
encomiums 1
gave 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
pain 1
than 1
the 1
benevolent 1
approbation 1
of 1
m 1
waldman 1
dn 1
the 1
fellow 1
cried 1
he 1
why 1
m 1
clerval 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
he 1
has 1
outstript 1
us 1
all 1
ay 1
stare 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
nevertheless 1
true 1
a 1
youngster 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
believed 1
in 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
as 1
firmly 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
gospel 1
has 1
now 1
set 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
soon 1
pulled 1
down 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
countenanceay 1
ay 1
continued 1

observing 1
my 1
face 1
expressive 1
of 1
suffering 1
m 1
frankenstein 1
is 1
modest 1
an 1
excellent 1
quality 1
in 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
young 1
men 1
should 1
be 1
diffident 1
of 1
themselves 1
you 1
know 1
m 1
clerval 1
i 1
was 1
myself 1
when 1
young 1
but 1
that 1
wears 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
now 1
commenced 1
an 1
eulogy 1
on 1
himself 1
which 1
happily 1
turned 1
the 1
conversation 1
from 1
a 1
subject 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
annoying 1
to 1
me 1
clerval 1
had 1
never 1
sympathized 1
in 1
my 1
tastes 1
for 1
natural 1
science 1
and 1
his 1
literary 1
pursuits 1
differed 1
wholly 1
from 1
those 1
which 1
had 1
occupied 1
me 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
university 1
with 1
the 1
design 1
of 1
making 1
himself 1
complete 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
oriental 1
languages 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
should 1
open 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
marked 1
out 1
for 1
himself 1
resolved 1
to 1
pursue 1
no 1
inglorious 1
career 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
eyes 1
toward 1
the 1
east 1
as 1
affording 1
scope 1
for 1
his 1
spirit 1
of 1
enterprise 1
the 1
persian 1
arabic 1
and 1
sanskrit 1
languages 1
engaged 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
easily 1
induced 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
studies 1
idleness 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
reflection 1
and 1
hated 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
i 1
felt 1
great 1
relief 1
in 1
being 1
the 1
fellowpupil 1
with 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
found 1
not 1
only 1
instruction 1
but 1
consolation 1
in 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
the 1
orientalists 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
him 1
attempt 1
a 1
critical 1
knowledge 1
of 1
their 1
dialects 1
for 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
contemplate 1
making 1
any 1
other 1
use 1
of 1
them 1
than 1
temporary 1
amusement 1
i 1
read 1
merely 1
to 1
understand 1
their 1
meaning 1
and 1
they 1
well 1
repaid 1
my 1
labours 1
their 1
melancholy 1
is 1
soothing 1
and 1
their 1
joy 1
elevating 1
to 1
a 1
degree 1
i 1
never 1
experienced 1
in 1
studying 1
the 1
authors 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
country 1
when 1
you 1
read 1
their 1
writings 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
consist 1
in 1
a 1
warm 1
sun 1
and 1
a 1
garden 1
of 1
rosesin 1
the 1
smiles 1
and 1
frowns 1
of 1
a 1
fair 1
enemy 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
consumes 1
your 1
own 1
heart 1
how 1
different 1
from 1
the 1
manly 1
and 1
heroical 1
poetry 1
of 1
greece 1
and 1
rome 1
summer 1
passed 1
away 1
in 1
these 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
was 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
autumn 1
but 1
being 1
delayed 1
by 1
several 1
accidents 1
winter 1
and 1
snow 1
arrived 1
the 1
roads 1
were 1
deemed 1
impassable 1
and 1
my 1
journey 1
was 1
retarded 1
until 1
the 1
ensuing 1
spring 1
i 1
felt 1
this 1
delay 1
very 1
bitterly 1
for 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
