friends 1
my 1
return 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
delayed 1
so 1
long 1
from 1
an 1
unwillingness 1
to 1
leave 1
clerval 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
place 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
the 1
winter 1
however 1
was 1
spent 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
spring 1
was 1
uncommonly 1
late 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
its 1
beauty 1
compensated 1
for 1
its 1
dilatoriness 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
may 1
had 1
already 1
commenced 1
and 1
i 1
expected 1
the 1
letter 1
daily 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
when 1
henry 1
proposed 1
a 1
pedestrian 1
tour 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
bid 1
a 1
personal 1
farewell 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
inhabited 1
i 1
acceded 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
this 1
proposition 1
i 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
exercise 1
and 1
clerval 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
my 1
favourite 1
companion 1
in 1
the 1
ramble 1
of 1
this 1
nature 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
among 1
the 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
fortnight 1
in 1
these 1
perambulations 1
my 1
health 1
and 1
spirits 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
restored 1
and 1
they 1
gained 1
additional 1
strength 1
from 1
the 1
salubrious 1
air 1
i 1
breathed 1
the 1
natural 1
incidents 1
of 1
our 1
progress 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
study 1
had 1
before 1
secluded 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
my 1
fellowcreatures 1
and 1
rendered 1
me 1
unsocial 1
but 1
clerval 1
called 1
forth 1
the 1
better 1
feelings 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
he 1
again 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
love 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
cheerful 1
faces 1
of 1
children 1
excellent 1
friend 1
how 1
sincerely 1
you 1
did 1
love 1
me 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
elevate 1
my 1
mind 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
your 1
own 1
a 1
selfish 1
pursuit 1
had 1
cramped 1
and 1
narrowed 1
me 1
until 1
your 1
gentleness 1
and 1
affection 1
warmed 1
and 1
opened 1
my 1
senses 1
i 1
became 1
the 1
same 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
loved 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
had 1
no 1
sorrow 1
or 1
care 1
when 1
happy 1
inanimate 1
nature 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
bestowing 1
on 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
sensations 1
a 1
serene 1
sky 1
and 1
verdant 1
fields 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
the 1
present 1
season 1
was 1
indeed 1
divine 1
the 1
flowers 1
of 1
spring 1
bloomed 1
in 1
the 1
hedges 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
summer 1
were 1
already 1
in 1
bud 1
i 1
was 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
thoughts 1
which 1
during 1
the 1
preceding 1
year 1
had 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
endeavours 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
off 1
with 1
an 1
invincible 1
burden 1
henry 1
rejoiced 1
in 1
my 1
gaiety 1
and 1
sincerely 1
sympathised 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
he 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
amuse 1
me 1
while 1
he 1
expressed 1
the 1
sensations 1
that 1
filled 1
his 1
soul 1
the 1
resources 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
were 1
truly 1
astonishing 1
his 1
conversation 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
imagination 1
and 1
very 1
often 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
persian 1
and 1
arabic 1
writers 1
he 1
invented 1
tales 1
of 1
wonderful 1
fancy 1
and 1
passion 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
repeated 1
my 1
favourite 1
poems 1
or 1
drew 1
me 1
out 1
into 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
supported 1
with 1
great 1
ingenuity 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
our 1
college 1
on 1
a 1
sunday 1
afternoon 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
dancing 1
and 1
every 1
one 1
we 1
met 1
appeared 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
my 1
own 1
spirits 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
i 1
bounded 1
along 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
unbridled 1
joy 1
and 1
hilarity 1
chapter 1
7 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
you 1
have 1
probably 1
waited 1
impatiently 1
for 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
your 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
tempted 1
to 1
write 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
merely 1
mentioning 1
the 1
day 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
expect 1
you 1
but 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
cruel 1
kindness 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
your 1
surprise 1
my 1
son 1
when 1
you 1
expected 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
glad 1
welcome 1
to 1
behold 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
tears 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
how 1
victor 1
can 1
i 1
relate 1
our 1
misfortune 1
absence 1
cannot 1
have 1
rendered 1
you 1
callous 1
to 1
our 1
joys 1
and 1
griefs 1
and 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
inflict 1
pain 1
on 1
my 1
long 1
absent 1
son 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
prepare 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
woeful 1
news 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
even 1
now 1
your 1
eye 1
skims 1
over 1
the 1
page 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
words 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
convey 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
horrible 1
tidings 1
william 1
is 1
deadthat 1
sweet 1
child 1
whose 1
smiles 1
delighted 1
and 1
warmed 1
my 1
heart 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
gay 1
victor 1
he 1
is 1
murdered 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
attempt 1
to 1
console 1
you 1
but 1
will 1
simply 1
relate 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
the 1
transaction 1
last 1
thursday 1
may 1
7th 1
i 1
my 1
niece 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
brothers 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
plainpalais 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
warm 1
and 1
serene 1
and 1
we 1
prolonged 1
our 1
walk 1
farther 1
than 1
usual 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
dusk 1
before 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
discovered 1
that 1
william 1
and 1
ernest 1
who 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
before 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
we 1
accordingly 1
rested 1
on 1
a 1
seat 1
until 1
they 1
should 1
return 1
presently 1
ernest 1
came 1
and 1
enquired 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
brother 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
with 1
him 1
that 1
william 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
vainly 1
sought 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
afterwards 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
this 1
account 1
rather 1
alarmed 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
continued 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
until 1
night 1
fell 1
when 1
elizabeth 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
we 1
returned 1
again 1
with 1
torches 1
for 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
rest 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
sweet 1
boy 1
had 1
lost 1
himself 1
and 1
was 1
exposed 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
damps 1
and 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
elizabeth 1
also 1
suffered 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
about 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
discovered 1
my 1
lovely 1
boy 1
whom 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
blooming 1
and 1
active 1
in 1
health 1
stretched 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
livid 1
and 1
motionless 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
the 1
murders 1
finger 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
he 1
was 1
conveyed 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
betrayed 1
the 1
secret 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
corpse 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
prevent 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
persisted 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
hastily 1
examined 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
victim 1
and 1
clasping 1
her 1
hands 1
exclaimed 1
o 1
god 1
i 1
have 1
murdered 1
my 1
darling 1
child 1
she 1
fainted 1
and 1
was 1
restored 1
with 1
extreme 1
difficulty 1
when 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
weep 1
and 1
sigh 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
that 1
same 1
evening 1
william 1
had 1
teased 1
her 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
wear 1
a 1
very 1
valuable 1
miniature 1
that 1
she 1
possessed 1
of 1
your 1
mother 1
this 1
picture 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
was 1
doubtless 1
the 1
temptation 1
which 1
urged 1
the 1
murderer 1
to 1
the 1
deed 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
present 1
although 1
our 1
exertions 1
to 1
discover 1
him 1
are 1
unremitted 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
restore 1
my 1
beloved 1
william 1
come 1
dearest 1
victor 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
console 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
weeps 1
continually 1
and 1
accuses 1
herself 1
unjustly 1
as 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
her 1
words 1
pierce 1
my 1
heart 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
unhappy 1
but 1
will 1
not 1
that 1
be 1
an 1
additional 1
motive 1
for 1
you 1
my 1
son 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
be 1
our 1
comforter 1
your 1
dear 1
mother 1
alas 1
victor 1
i 1
now 1
say 1
thank 1
god 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
live 1
to 1
witness 1
the 1
cruel 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
her 1
youngest 1
darling 1
come 1
victor 1
not 1
brooding 1
thoughts 1
of 1
vengeance 1
against 1
the 1
assassin 1
but 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
gentleness 1
that 1
will 1
heal 1
instead 1
of 1
festering 1
the 1
wounds 1
of 1
our 1
minds 1
enter 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
not 1
with 1
hatred 1
for 1
your 1
enemies 1
your 1
affectionate 1
and 1
afflicted 1
father 1
alphonse 1

17 1
clerval 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
countenance 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
this 1
letter 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
observe 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
succeeded 1
the 1
joy 1
i 1
at 1
first 1
expressed 1
on 1
receiving 1
new 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
i 1
threw 1
the 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
covered 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
henry 1
when 1
he 1
perceived 1
me 1
weep 1
with 1
bitterness 1
are 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
be 1
unhappy 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
i 1
motioned 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
letter 1
while 1
i 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
extremest 1
agitation 1
tears 1
also 1
gushed 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
clerval 1
as 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
misfortune 1
i 1
can 1
offer 1
you 1
no 1
consolation 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
your 1
disaster 1
is 1
irreparable 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
go 1
instantly 1
to 1
geneva 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
henry 1
to 1
order 1
the 1
horses 1
during 1
our 1
walk 1
clerval 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
of 1
consolation 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
express 1
his 1
heartfelt 1
sympathy 1
poor 1
william 1
said 1
he 1
dear 1
lovely 1
child 1
he 1
now 1
sleeps 1
with 1
his 1
angel 1
mother 1
who 1
that 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
bright 1
and 1
joyous 1
in 1
his 1
young 1
beauty 1
but 1
must 1
weep 1
over 1
his 1
untimely 1
loss 1
to 1
die 1
so 1
miserably 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
murderers 1
grasp 1
how 1
much 1
more 1
a 1
murdered 1
that 1
could 1
destroy 1
radiant 1
innocence 1
poor 1
little 1
fellow 1
one 1
only 1
consolation 1
have 1
we 1
his 1
friends 1
mourn 1
and 1
weep 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
rest 1
the 1
pang 1
is 1
over 1
his 1
sufferings 1
are 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
ever 1
a 1
sod 1
covers 1
his 1
gentle 1
form 1
and 1
he 1
knows 1
no 1
pain 1
he 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
a 1
subject 1
for 1
pity 1
we 1
must 1
reserve 1
that 1
for 1
his 1
miserable 1
survivors 1
clerval 1
spoke 1
thus 1
as 1
we 1
hurried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
the 1
words 1
impressed 1
themselves 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
i 1
remembered 1
them 1
afterwards 1
in 1
solitude 1
but 1
now 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
horses 1
arrived 1
i 1
hurried 1
into 1
a 1
cabriolet 1
and 1
bade 1
farewell 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
my 1
journey 1
was 1
very 1
melancholy 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
for 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
console 1
and 1
sympathise 1
with 1
my 1
loved 1
and 1
sorrowing 1
friends 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
drew 1
near 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
i 1
slackened 1
my 1
progress 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
sustain 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
feelings 1
that 1
crowded 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
passed 1
through 1
scenes 1
familiar 1
to 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
nearly 1
six 1
years 1
how 1
altered 1
every 1
thing 1
might 1
be 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
one 1
sudden 1
and 1
desolating 1
change 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
thousand 1
little 1
circumstances 1
might 1
have 1
by 1
degrees 1
worked 1
other 1
alterations 1
which 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
done 1
more 1
tranquilly 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
less 1
decisive 1
fear 1
overcame 1
me 1
i 1
dared 1
no 1
advance 1
dreading 1
a 1
thousand 1
nameless 1
evils 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
define 1
them 1
i 1
remained 1
two 1
days 1
at 1
lausanne 1
in 1
this 1
painful 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
placid 1
all 1
around 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
the 1
palaces 1
of 1
nature 1
were 1
not 1
changed 1
by 1
degrees 1
the 1
calm 1
and 1
heavenly 1
scene 1
restored 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
towards 1
geneva 1
the 1
road 1
ran 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
became 1
narrower 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
i 1
discovered 1
more 1
distinctly 1
the 1
black 1
sides 1
of 1
jura 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
summit 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
i 1
wept 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
dear 1
mountains 1
my 1
own 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
welcome 1
your 1
wanderer 1
your 1
summits 1
are 1
clear 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
lake 1
are 1
blue 1
and 1
placid 1
is 1
this 1
to 1
prognosticate 1
peace 1
or 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
unhappiness 1
i 1
fear 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
render 1
myself 1
tedious 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
preliminary 1
circumstances 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
days 1
of 1
comparative 1
happiness 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
pleasure 1
my 1
country 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
native 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
delight 1
i 1
took 1
in 1
again 1
beholding 1
thy 1
streams 1
thy 1
mountains 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
thy 1
lovely 1
lake 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
drew 1
nearer 1
home 1
grief 1
and 1
fear 1
again 1
overcame 1
me 1
night 1
also 1
closed 1
around 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
the 1
dark 1
mountains 1
i 1
felt 1
still 1
more 1
gloomily 1
the 1
picture 1
appeared 1
a 1
vast 1
and 1
dim 1
scene 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
i 1
foresaw 1
obscurely 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
wretched 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
alas 1
i 1
prophesied 1
truly 1
and 1
failed 1
only 1
in 1
one 1
single 1
circumstance 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
i 1
imagined 1
and 1
dreaded 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
conceive 1
the 1
hundredth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
it 1
was 1
completely 1
dark 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
geneva 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
were 1
already 1
shut 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
at 1
secheron 1
a 1
village 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
serene 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rest 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
my 1
poor 1
william 1
had 1
been 1
murdered 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
cross 1
the 1
lake 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
plainpalais 1
during 1
this 1
short 1
voyage 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
lightning 1
playing 1
on 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
figures 1
the 1
storm 1
appeared 1
to 1
approach 1
rapidly 1
and 1
on 1
landing 1
i 1
ascended 1
a 1
low 1
hill 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
observe 1
its 1
progress 1
it 1
advanced 1
the 1
heavens 1
were 1
clouded 1
and 1
i 1
soon 1
felt 1
the 1
rain 1
coming 1
slowly 1
in 1
large 1
drops 1
but 1
its 1
violence 1
quickly 1
increased 1
i 1
quitted 1
my 1
seat 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
although 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 1
storm 1
increased 1
every 1
minute 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
with 1
a 1
terrific 1
crash 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
it 1
was 1
echoed 1
from 1
saleve 1
the 1
juras 1
and 1
the 1
alps 1
of 1
savoy 1
vivid 1
flashes 1
of 1
lightning 1
dazzled 1
my 1
eyes 1
illuminating 1
the 1
lake 1
making 1
it 1
appear 1
like 1
a 1
vast 1
sheet 1
of 1
fire 1
then 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
every 1
thing 1
seemed 1
of 1
a 1
pitchy 1
darkness 1
until 1
the 1
eye 1
recovered 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
preceding 1
flash 1
the 1
storm 1
as 1
is 1
often 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
switzerland 1
appeared 1
at 1
once 1
in 1
various 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
most 1
violent 1
storm 1
hung 1
exactly 1
north 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
over 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
lies 1
between 1
the 1
promontory 1
of 1
belrive 1
and 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
copet 1
another 1
storm 1
enlightened 1
jura 1
with 1
faint 1
flashes 1
and 1
another 1
darkened 1
and 1
sometimes 1
disclosed 1
the 1
mole 1
a 1
peaked 1
mountain 1
to 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
while 1
i 1
watched 1
the 1
tempest 1
so 1
beautiful 1
yet 1
terrific 1
i 1
wandered 1
on 1
with 1
a 1
hasty 1
step 1
this 1
noble 1
war 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
elevated 1
my 1
spirits 1
i 1
clasped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
aloud 1
william 1
dear 1
angel 1
this 1
is 1
thy 1
funeral 1
this 1
thy 1
dirge 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
these 1
words 1
i 1
perceived 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
a 1
figure 1
which 1
stole 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
near 1
me 1
i 1
stood 1
fixed 1
gazing 1
intently 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
mistaken 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
lightning 1
illuminated 1
the 1
object 1
and 1
discovered 1
its 1
shape 1
plainly 1
to 1
me 1
its 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
and 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
its 1
aspect 1
more 1
hideous 1
than 1
belongs 1
to 1
humanity 1
instantly 1
informed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
the 1
filthy 1
daemon 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
there 1
could 1
he 1
be 1
i 1
shuddered 1
at 1
the 1
conception 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
no 1
sooner 1
did 1
that 1
idea 1
cross 1
my 1
imagination 1
than 1
i 1
became 1
convinced 1
of 1
its 1
truth 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
lean 1
against 1
a 1
tree 1
for 1
support 1
the 1
figure 1
passed 1
me 1
quickly 1
and 1
i 1
lost 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
nothing 1
in 1
human 1
shape 1
could 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
fair 1
child 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
it 1
the 1
mere 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
an 1
irresistible 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
pursuing 1
the 1
devil 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
another 1
flash 1
discovered 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
hanging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
nearly 1
perpendicular 1
ascent 1
of 1
mont 1
saleve 1
a 1
hill 1
that 1
bounds 1
plainpalais 1
on 1
the 1
south 1
he 1
soon 1
reached 1
the 1
summit 1
and 1
disappeared 1
i 1
remained 1
motionless 1
the 1
thunder 1
ceased 1
but 1
the 1
rain 1
still 1
continued 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
enveloped 1
in 1
an 1
impenetrable 1
darkness 1
i 1
revolved 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
the 1
events 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
until 1
now 1
sought 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
whole 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
progress 1
toward 1
the 1
creation 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
hands 1
at 1
my 1
bedside 1
its 1
departure 1
two 1
years 1
had 1
now 1
nearly 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
received 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
this 1
his 1
first 1
crime 1
alas 1
i 1
had 1
turned 1
loose 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
a 1
depraved 1
wretch 1
whose 1
delight 1
was 1
in 1
carnage 1
and 1
misery 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
anguish 1
i 1
suffered 1
during 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
which 1
i 1
spent 1
cold 1
and 1
wet 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
the 1
inconvenience 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
busy 1
in 1
scenes 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
despair 1
i 1
considered 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
cast 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
endowed 1
with 1
the 1
will 1
and 1
power 1
to 1
effect 1
purposes 1
of 1
horror 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
deed 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
now 1
done 1
nearly 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
vampire 1
my 1
own 1
spirit 1
let 1
loose 1
from 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
destroy 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
day 1
dawned 1
and 1
i 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
the 1
gates 1
were 1
open 1
and 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
my 1
fathers 1
house 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
i 1
knew 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
and 1
cause 1
instant 1
pursuit 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
but 1
i 1
paused 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
story 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
myself 1
had 1
formed 1
and 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
had 1
met 1
me 1
at 1
midnight 1
among 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
an 1
inaccessible 1
mountain 1
i 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
nervous 1
fever 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
seized 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
dated 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
which 1
would 1
give 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
delirium 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
otherwise 1
so 1
utterly 1
improbable 1
i 1
well 1
knew 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
had 1
communicated 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
insanity 1
besides 1
the 1
strange 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
animal 1
would 1
elude 1
all 1
pursuit 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
so 1
far 1
credited 1
as 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
relatives 1
to 1
commence 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
would 1
be 1
pursuit 1
who 1
could 1
arrest 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
scaling 1
the 1
overhanging 1
sides 1
of 1
mont 1
saleve 1
these 1
reflections 1
determined 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
remain 1
silent 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
fathers 1
house 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
servants 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
to 1
attend 1
their 1
usual 1
hour 1
of 1
rising 1
six 1
years 1
had 1
elapsed 1
passed 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
indelible 1
trace 1
and 1
i 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
last 1
embraced 1
my 1
father 1
before 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
beloved 1
and 1
venerable 1
parent 1
he 1
still 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
stood 1
over 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
historical 1
subject 1
painted 1
at 1
my 1
fathers 1
desire 1
and 1
represented 1
caroline 1
beaufort 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
kneeling 1
by 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
her 1
dead 1
father 1
her 1
garb 1
was 1
rustic 1
and 1
her 1
cheek 1
pale 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
dignity 1
and 1
beauty 1
that 1
hardly 1
permitted 1
the 1
sentiment 1
of 1
pity 1
below 1
this 1
picture 1
was 1
a 1
miniature 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
my 1
tears 1
flowed 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
ernest 1
entered 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
me 1
arrive 1
and 1
hastened 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
welcome 1
my 1
dearest 1
victor 1
said 1
he 1
ah 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
three 1
months 1
ago 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
us 1
all 1
joyous 1
and 1
delighted 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
now 1
to 1
share 1
a 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
can 1
alleviate 1
yet 1
your 1
presence 1
will 1
i 1
hope 1
revive 1
our 1
father 1
who 1
seems 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
misfortune 1
and 1
your 1
persuasions 1
will 1
induce 1
poor 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
cease 1
her 1
vain 1
and 1
tormenting 1
selfaccusationspoor 1
william 1
he 1
was 1
our 1
darling 1
and 1
our 1
pride 1
tears 1
unrestrained 1
fell 1
from 1
my 1
brothers 1
eyes 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
mortal 1
agony 1
crept 1
over 1
my 1
frame 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
only 1
imagined 1
the 1
wretchedness 1
of 1
my 1
desolated 1
home 1
the 1
reality 1
came 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
a 1
not 1
less 1
terrible 1
disaster 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
calm 1
ernest 1
i 1
enquired 1
more 1
minutely 1
concerning 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
named 1
my 1
cousin 1
she 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
said 1
ernest 1
requires 1
consolation 1
she 1
accused 1
herself 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
very 1
wretched 1
but 1
since 1
the 1
murderer 1
has 1
been 1
discovered 1
the 1
murderer 1
discovered 1
good 1
god 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
who 1
could 1
attempt 1
to 1
pursue 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
one 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
try 1
to 1
overtake 1
the 1
winds 1
or 1
confine 1
a 1
mountainstream 1
with 1
a 1
straw 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
too 1
he 1
was 1
free 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
replied 1
my 1
brother 1
in 1
accents 1
of 1
wonder 1
but 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
discovery 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
completes 1
our 1
misery 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
believe 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
even 1
now 1
elizabeth 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
convinced 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
indeed 1
who 1
would 1
credit 1
that 1
justine 1
moritz 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
amiable 1
and 1
fond 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
could 1
suddenly 1
become 1
so 1
capable 1
of 1
so 1
frightful 1
so 1
appalling 1
a 1
crime 1
justine 1
moritz 1
poor 1
poor 1
girl 1
is 1
she 1
the 1
accused 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
wrongfully 1
every 1
one 1
knows 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
believes 1
it 1
surely 1
ernest 1
no 1
one 1
did 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
several 1
circumstances 1
came 1
out 1
that 1
have 1
almost 1
forced 1
conviction 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
her 1
own 1
behaviour 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
confused 1
as 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
facts 1
a 1
weight 1
that 1
i 1
fear 1
leaves 1
no 1
hope 1
for 1
doubt 1
but 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
hear 1
all 1
he 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
the 1
morning 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
justine 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
ill 1
and 1
confined 1
to 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
during 1
this 1
interval 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
happening 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
apparel 1
she 1
had 1
worn 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
discovered 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
judged 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
temptation 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
the 1
servant 1
instantly 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
who 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
upon 1
their 1
deposition 1
justine 1
was 1
apprehended 1
on 1
being 1
charged 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
confirmed 1
the 1
suspicion 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
measure 1
by 1
her 1
extreme 1
confusion 1
of 1
manner 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
tale 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
shake 1
my 1
faith 1
and 1
i 1
replied 1
earnestly 1
you 1
are 1
all 1
mistaken 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
murderer 1
justine 1
poor 1
good 1
justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
i 1
saw 1
unhappiness 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
but 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
exchanged 1
our 1
mournful 1
greeting 1
would 1
have 1
introduced 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
our 1
disaster 1
had 1
not 1
ernest 1
exclaimed 1
good 1
god 1
papa 1
victor 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
we 1
do 1
also 1
unfortunately 1
replied 1
my 1
father 1
for 1
indeed 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
have 1
been 1
for 1
ever 1
ignorant 1
than 1
have 1
discovered 1
so 1
much 1
depravity 1
and 1
ungratitude 1
in 1
one 1
i 1
valued 1
so 1
highly 1
my 1
dear 1
father 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
god 1
forbid 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
suffer 1
as 1
guilty 1
she 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
i 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
acquitted 1
this 1
speech 1
calmed 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
firmly 1
convinced 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
justine 1
and 1
indeed 1
every 1
human 1
being 1
was 1
guiltless 1
of 1
this 1
murder 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
fear 1
therefore 1
that 1
any 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
could 1
be 1
brought 1
forward 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
convict 1
her 1
my 1
tale 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
to 1
announce 1
publicly 1
its 1
astounding 1
horror 1
would 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
madness 1
by 1
the 1
vulgar 1
did 1
any 1
one 1
indeed 1
exist 1
except 1
i 1
the 1
creator 1
who 1
would 1
believe 1
unless 1
his 1
senses 1
convinced 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
monument 1
of 1
presumption 1
and 1
rash 1
ignorance 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
world 1
we 1
were 1
soon 1
joined 1
by 1
elizabeth 1
time 1
had 1
altered 1
her 1
since 1
i 1
last 1
beheld 1
her 1
it 1
had 1
endowed 1
her 1
with 1
loveliness 1
surpassing 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
her 1
childish 1
years 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
candour 1
the 1
same 1
vivacity 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
allied 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
more 1
full 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
intellect 1
she 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
your 1
arrival 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
you 1
perhaps 1
will 1
find 1
some 1
means 1
to 1
justify 1
my 1
poor 1
guiltless 1
justine 1
alas 1
who 1
is 1
safe 1
if 1
she 1
be 1
convicted 1
of 1
crime 1
i 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
certainly 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
our 1
misfortune 1
is 1
doubly 1
hard 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
only 1
lost 1
that 1
lovely 1
darling 1
boy 1
but 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
whom 1
i 1
sincerely 1
love 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
torn 1
away 1
by 1
even 1
a 1
worse 1
fate 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
condemned 1
i 1
never 1
shall 1
know 1
joy 1
more 1
but 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
again 1
even 1
after 1
the 1
sad 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
william 1
she 1
is 1
innocent 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
that 1
shall 1
be 1
proved 1
fear 1
nothing 1
but 1
let 1
your 1
spirits 1
be 1
cheered 1
by 1
the 1
assurance 1
of 1
her 1
acquittal 1
how 1
kind 1
and 1
generous 1
you 1
are 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
believes 1
in 1
her 1
guilt 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
for 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
and 1
to 1
see 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
prejudiced 1
in 1
so 1
deadly 1
a 1
manner 1
rendered 1
me 1
hopeless 1
and 1
despairing 1
she 1
wept 1
dearest 1
niece 1
said 1
my 1
father 1
dry 1
your 1
tears 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
as 1
you 1
believe 1
innocent 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
our 1
laws 1
and 1
the 1
activity 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
prevent 1
the 1
slightest 1
shadow 1
of 1
partiality 1
chapter 1
8 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
few 1
sad 1
hours 1
until 1
eleven 1
oclock 1
when 1
the 1
trial 1
was 1
to 1
commence 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
attend 1
as 1
witnesses 1
i 1
accompanied 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
during 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
this 1
wretched 1
mockery 1
of 1
justice 1
i 1
suffered 1
living 1
torture 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
decided 1
whether 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
lawless 1
devices 1
would 1
cause 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
one 1
a 1
smiling 1
babe 1
full 1
of 1
innocence 1
and 1
joy 1
the 1
other 1
far 1
more 1
dreadfully 1
murdered 1
with 1
every 1
aggravation 1
of 1
infamy 1
that 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
murder 1
memorable 1
in 1
horror 1
justine 1
also 1
was 1
a 1
girl 1
of 1
merit 1
and 1
possessed 1
qualities 1
which 1
promised 1
to 1
render 1
her 1
life 1
happy 1
now 1
all 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
obliterated 1
in 1
an 1
ignominious 1
grave 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
cause 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
rather 1
would 1
i 1
have 1
confessed 1
myself 1
guilty 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
ascribed 1
to 1
justine 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
absent 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
committed 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
declaration 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exculpated 1
her 1
who 1
suffered 1
through 1
me 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
justine 1
was 1
calm 1
she 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
mourning 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
always 1
engaging 1
was 1
rendered 1
by 1
the 1
solemnity 1
of 1
her 1
feelings 1
exquisitely 1
beautiful 1
yet 1
she 1
appeared 1
confident 1
in 1
innocence 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
tremble 1
although 1
gazed 1
on 1
and 1
execrated 1
by 1
thousands 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
kindness 1
which 1
her 1
beauty 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
excited 1
was 1
obliterated 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
spectators 1
by 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
the 1
enormity 1
she 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
committed 1
she 1
was 1
tranquil 1
yet 1
her 1
tranquillity 1
was 1
evidently 1
constrained 1
and 1
as 1
her 1
confusion 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
adduced 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
guilt 1
she 1
worked 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
courage 1
when 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
court 1
she 1
threw 1
her 1
eyes 1
round 1
it 1
and 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
seated 1
a 1
tear 1
seemed 1
to 1
dim 1
her 1
eye 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
quickly 1
recovered 1
herself 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
sorrowful 1
affection 1
seemed 1
to 1
attest 1
her 1
utter 1
guiltlessness 1
the 1
trial 1
began 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
advocate 1
against 1
her 1
had 1
stated 1
the 1
charge 1
several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
several 1
strange 1
facts 1
combined 1
against 1
her 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
staggered 1
anyone 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
such 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
and 1
towards 1
morning 1
had 1
been 1
perceived 1
by 1
a 1
marketwoman 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
afterwards 1
found 1
the 1
woman 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
she 1
did 1
there 1
but 1
she 1
looked 1
very 1
strangely 1
and 1
only 1
returned 1
a 1
confused 1
and 1
unintelligible 1
answer 1
she 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
eight 1
oclock 1
and 1
when 1
one 1
inquired 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
replied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
demanded 1
earnestly 1
if 1
anything 1
had 1
been 1
heard 1
concerning 1
him 1
when 1
shown 1
the 1
body 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
violent 1
hysterics 1
and 1
kept 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
then 1
produced 1
which 1
the 1
servant 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
when 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
a 1
faltering 1
voice 1
proved 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
which 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
missed 1
she 1
had 1
placed 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
a 1
murmur 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
filled 1
the 1
court 1
justine 1
was 1
called 1
on 1
for 1
her 1
defence 1
as 1
the 1
trial 1
had 1
proceeded 1
her 1
countenance 1
had 1
altered 1
surprise 1
horror 1
and 1
misery 1
were 1
strongly 1
expressed 1
sometimes 1
she 1
struggled 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
desired 1
to 1
plead 1
she 1
collected 1
her 1
powers 1
and 1
spoke 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
although 1
variable 1
voice 1
god 1
knows 1
she 1
said 1
how 1
entirely 1
i 1
am 1
innocent 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
pretend 1
that 1
my 1
protestations 1
should 1
acquit 1
me 1
i 1
rest 1
my 1
innocence 1
on 1
a 1
plain 1
and 1
simple 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
adduced 1
against 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
the 1
character 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
borne 1
will 1
incline 1
my 1
judges 1
to 1
a 1
favourable 1
interpretation 1
where 1
any 1
circumstance 1
appears 1
doubtful 1
or 1
suspicious 1
she 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
permission 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
evening 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
an 1
aunt 1
at 1
chene 1
a 1
village 1
situated 1
at 1
about 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
geneva 1
on 1
her 1
return 1
at 1
about 1
nine 1
oclock 1
she 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
lost 1
she 1
was 1
alarmed 1
by 1
this 1
account 1
and 1
passed 1
several 1
hours 1
in 1
looking 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
geneva 1
were 1
shut 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
a 1
barn 1
belonging 1
to 1
a 1
cottage 1
being 1
unwilling 1
to 1
call 1
up 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
to 1
whom 1
she 1
was 1
well 1
known 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
spent 1
here 1
watching 1
towards 1
morning 1
she 1
believed 1
that 1
she 1
slept 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
some 1
steps 1
disturbed 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
dawn 1
and 1
she 1
quitted 1
her 1
asylum 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
again 1
endeavour 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
brother 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
his 1
body 1
lay 1
it 1
was 1
without 1
her 1
knowledge 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
bewildered 1
when 1
questioned 1
by 1
the 1
marketwoman 1
was 1
not 1
surprising 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
sleepless 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
was 1
yet 1
uncertain 1
concerning 1
the 1
picture 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
account 1
i 1
know 1
continued 1
the 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
how 1
heavily 1
and 1
fatally 1
this 1
one 1
circumstance 1
weighs 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
power 1
of 1
explaining 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
expressed 1
my 1
utter 1
ignorance 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
left 1
to 1
conjecture 1
concerning 1
the 1
probabilities 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
but 1
here 1
also 1
i 1
am 1
checked 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
enemy 1
on 1
earth 1
and 1
none 1
surely 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
wicked 1
as 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
wantonly 1
did 1
the 1
murderer 1
place 1
it 1
there 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
no 1
opportunity 1
afforded 1
him 1
for 1
so 1
doing 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
have 1
stolen 1
the 1
jewel 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
it 1
again 1
so 1
soon 1
i 1
commit 1
my 1
cause 1
to 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
my 1
judges 1
yet 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
hope 1
i 1
beg 1
permission 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
few 1
witnesses 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
character 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
testimony 1
shall 1
not 1
overweigh 1
my 1
supposed 1
guilt 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
condemned 1
although 1
i 1
would 1
pledge 1
my 1
salvation 1
on 1
my 1
innocence 1
several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
her 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
they 1
spoke 1
well 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
fear 1
and 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
which 1
they 1
supposed 1
her 1
guilty 1
rendered 1
them 1
timorous 1
and 1
unwilling 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
elizabeth 1
saw 1
even 1
this 1
last 1
resource 1
her 1
excellent 1
dispositions 1
and 1
irreproachable 1
conduct 1
about 1
to 1
fail 1
the 1
accused 1
when 1
although 1
violently 1
agitated 1
she 1
desired 1
permission 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
court 1
i 1
am 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
cousin 1
of 1
the 1
unhappy 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
murdered 1
or 1
rather 1
his 1
sister 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
and 1
have 1
lived 1
with 1
his 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
and 1
even 1
long 1
before 1
his 1
birth 1
it 1
may 1
therefore 1
be 1
judged 1
indecent 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
fellow 1
creature 1
about 1
to 1
perish 1
through 1
the 1
cowardice 1
of 1
her 1
pretended 1
friends 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
speak 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
what 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
her 1
character 1
i 1
am 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
accused 1
i 1
have 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
house 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
for 1
five 1
and 1
at 1
another 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
period 1
she 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
she 1
nursed 1
madame 1
frankenstein 1
my 1
aunt 1
in 1
her 1
last 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
and 1
care 1
and 1
afterwards 1
attended 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
during 1
a 1
tedious 1
illness 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
excited 1
the 1
admiration 1
of 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
after 1
which 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
in 1
my 1
uncles 1
house 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
she 1
was 1
warmly 1
attached 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead 1
and 1
acted 1
towards 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
most 1
affectionate 1
mother 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
produced 1
against 1
her 1
i 1
believe 1
and 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
perfect 1
innocence 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
temptation 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
action 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
bauble 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
chief 1
proof 1
rests 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
earnestly 1
desired 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
willingly 1
given 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
do 1
i 1
esteem 1
and 1
value 1
her 1
a 1
murmur 1
of 1
approbation 1
followed 1
elizabeths 1
simple 1
and 1
powerful 1
appeal 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
excited 1
by 1
her 1
generous 1
interference 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
poor 1
justine 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
public 1
indignation 1
was 1
turned 1
with 1
renewed 1
violence 1
charging 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
blackest 1
ingratitude 1
she 1
herself 1
wept 1
as 1
elizabeth 1
spoke 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
my 1
own 1
agitation 1
and 1
anguish 1
was 1
extreme 1
during 1
the 1
whole 1
trial 1
i 1
believed 1
in 1
her 1
innocence 1
i 1
knew 1
it 1
could 1
the 1
demon 1
who 1
had 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
doubt 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
hellish 1
sport 1
have 1
betrayed 1
the 1
innocent 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
ignominy 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
situation 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
popular 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
judges 1
had 1
already 1
condemned 1
my 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
in 1
agony 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
the 1
accused 1
did 1
not 1
equal 1
mine 1
she 1
was 1
sustained 1
by 1
innocence 1
but 1
the 1
fangs 1
of 1
remorse 1
tore 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
forgo 1
their 1
hold 1
i 1
passed 1
a 1
night 1
of 1
unmingled 1
wretchedness 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
throat 1
were 1
parched 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
ask 1
the 1
fatal 1
question 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
known 1
and 1
the 1
officer 1
guessed 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
visit 1
the 1
ballots 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
black 1
and 1
justine 1
was 1
condemned 1
i 1
cannot 1
pretend 1
to 1
describe 1
what 1
i 1
then 1
felt 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
experienced 1
sensations 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
bestow 1
upon 1
them 1
adequate 1
expressions 1
but 1
words 1
cannot 1
convey 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
heartsickening 1
despair 1
that 1
i 1
then 1
endured 1
the 1
person 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
addressed 1
myself 1
added 1
that 1
justine 1
had 1
already 1
confessed 1
her 1
guilt 1
that 1
evidence 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
hardly 1
required 1
in 1
so 1
glaring 1
a 1
case 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
indeed 1
none 1
of 1
our 1
judges 1
like 1
to 1
condemn 1
a 1
criminal 1
upon 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
be 1
it 1
ever 1
so 1
decisive 1
this 1
was 1
strange 1
and 1
unexpected 1
intelligence 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
mean 1
had 1
my 1
eyes 1
deceived 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
i 1
really 1
as 1
mad 1
as 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
would 1
believe 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
if 1
i 1
disclosed 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
suspicions 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
return 1
home 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
eagerly 1
demanded 1
the 1
result 1
my 1
cousin 1
replied 1
i 1
it 1
is 1
decided 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
expected 1
all 1
judges 1
had 1
rather 1
that 1
ten 1
innocent 1
should 1
suffer 1
than 1
that 1
one 1
guilty 1
should 1
escape 1
but 1
she 1
has 1
confessed 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
dire 1
blow 1
to 1
poor 1
elizabeth 1
who 1
had 1
relied 1
with 1
firmness 1
upon 1
justines 1
innocence 1
alas 1
said 1
she 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
ever 1
again 1
believe 1
in 1
human 1
goodness 1
justine 1
whom 1
i 1
loved 1
and 1
esteemed 1
as 1
my 1
sister 1
how 1
could 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
those 1
smiles 1
of 1
innocence 1
only 1
to 1
betray 1
her 1
mild 1
eyes 1
seemed 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
severity 1
or 1
guile 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
has 1
committed 1
a 1
murder 1
soon 1
after 1
we 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
victim 1
had 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
cousin 1
my 1
father 1
wished 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
judgment 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
decide 1
yes 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
although 1
she 1
is 1
guilty 1
and 1
you 1
victor 1
shall 1
accompany 1
me 1
i 1
cannot 1
go 1
alone 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
visit 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
we 1
entered 1
the 1
gloomy 1
prison 1
chamber 1
and 1
beheld 1
justine 1
sitting 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
her 1
hands 1
were 1
manacled 1
and 1
her 1
head 1
rested 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
she 1
rose 1
on 1
seeing 1
us 1
enter 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
left 1
alone 1
with 1
her 1
she 1
threw 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
my 1
cousin 1
wept 1
also 1
oh 1
justine 1
said 1
she 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
last 1
consolation 1
i 1
relied 1
on 1
your 1
innocence 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
very 1
wretched 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
also 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
very 1
very 1
wicked 1
do 1
you 1
also 1
join 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
to 1
crush 1
me 1
to 1
condemn 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
murderer 1
her 1
voice 1
was 1
suffocated 1
with 1
sobs 1
rise 1
my 1
poor 1
girl 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
kneel 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
innocent 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
i 1
believed 1
you 1
guiltless 1
notwithstanding 1
every 1
evidence 1
until 1
i 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
yourself 1
declared 1
your 1
guilt 1
that 1
report 1
you 1
say 1
is 1
false 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
dear 1
justine 1
that 1
nothing 1
can 1
shake 1
my 1
confidence 1
in 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
confession 1
i 1
did 1
confess 1
but 1
i 1
confessed 1
a 1
lie 1
i 1
confessed 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
obtain 1
absolution 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
falsehood 1
lies 1
heavier 1
at 1
my 1
heart 1
than 1
all 1
my 1
other 1
sins 1
the 1
god 1
of 1
heaven 1
forgive 1
me 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
was 1
condemned 1
my 1
confessor 1
has 1
besieged 1
me 1
he 1
threatened 1
and 1
menaced 1
until 1
i 1
almost 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
he 1
threatened 1
excommunication 1
and 1
hell 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
moments 1
if 1
i 1
continued 1
obdurate 1
dear 1
lady 1
i 1
had 1
none 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
all 1
looked 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
wretch 1
doomed 1
to 1
ignominy 1
and 1
perdition 1
what 1
could 1
i 1
do 1
in 1
an 1
evil 1
hour 1
i 1
subscribed 1
to 1
a 1
lie 1
and 1
now 1
only 1
am 1
i 1
truly 1
miserable 1
she 1
paused 1
weeping 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
i 1
thought 1
with 1
horror 1
my 1
sweet 1
lady 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
believe 1
your 1
justine 1
whom 1
your 1
blessed 1
aunt 1
had 1
so 1
highly 1
honoured 1
and 1
whom 1
you 1
loved 1
was 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
which 1
none 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
himself 1
could 1
have 1
perpetrated 1
dear 1
william 1
dearest 1
blessed 1
child 1
i 1
soon 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
in 1
heaven 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
consoles 1
me 1
going 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
suffer 1
ignominy 1
and 1
death 1
oh 1
justine 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
having 1
for 1
one 1
moment 1
distrusted 1
you 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
confess 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
mourn 1
dear 1
girl 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
i 1
will 1
proclaim 1
i 1
will 1
prove 1
your 1
innocence 1
i 1
will 1
melt 1
the 1
stony 1
hearts 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
by 1
my 1
tears 1
and 1
prayers 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
die 1
you 1
my 1
playfellow 1
my 1
companion 1
my 1
sister 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
no 1
no 1
i 1
never 1
could 1
survive 1
so 1
horrible 1
a 1
misfortune 1
justine 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
mournfully 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
to 1
die 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
pang 1
is 1
past 1
god 1
raises 1
my 1
weakness 1
and 1
gives 1
me 1
courage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
worst 1
i 1
leave 1
a 1
sad 1
and 1
bitter 1
world 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
remember 1
me 1
and 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
of 1
one 1
unjustly 1
condemned 1
i 1
am 1
resigned 1
to 1
the 1
fate 1
awaiting 1
me 1
learn 1
from 1
me 1
dear 1
lady 1
to 1
submit 1
in 1
patience 1
to 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
heaven 1
during 1
this 1
conversation 1
i 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
prison 1
room 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
conceal 1
the 1
horrid 1
anguish 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
despair 1
who 1
dared 1
talk 1
of 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
victim 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
awful 1
boundary 1
between 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
felt 1
not 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
such 1
deep 1
and 1
bitter 1
agony 1
i 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
ground 1
them 1
together 1
uttering 1
a 1
groan 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
inmost 1
soul 1
justine 1
started 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
sir 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
you 1
i 1
hope 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
guilty 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
no 1
justine 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
he 1
is 1
more 1
convinced 1
of 1
your 1
innocence 1
than 1
i 1
was 1
for 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
confessed 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
i 1
truly 1
thank 1
him 1
in 1
these 1
last 1
moments 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
sincerest 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
those 1
who 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
with 1
kindness 1
how 1
sweet 1
is 1
the 1
affection 1
of 1
others 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
it 1
removes 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
my 1
misfortune 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
die 1
in 1
peace 1
now 1
that 1
my 1
innocence 1
is 1
acknowledged 1
by 1
you 1
dear 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
cousin 1
thus 1
the 1
poor 1
sufferer 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
others 1
and 1
herself 1
she 1
indeed 1
gained 1
the 1
resignation 1
she 1
desired 1
but 1
i 1
the 1
true 1
murderer 1
felt 1
the 1
neverdying 1
worm 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
which 1
allowed 1
of 1
no 1
hope 1
or 1
consolation 1
elizabeth 1
also 1
wept 1
and 1
was 1
unhappy 1
but 1
hers 1
also 1
was 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
innocence 1
which 1
like 1
a 1
cloud 1
that 1
passes 1
over 1
the 1
fair 1
moon 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
hides 1
but 1
cannot 1
tarnish 1
its 1
brightness 1
anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
had 1
penetrated 1
into 1
the 1
core 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
which 1
nothing 1
could 1
extinguish 1
we 1
stayed 1
several 1
hours 1
with 1
justine 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
great 1
difficulty 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
could 1
tear 1
herself 1
away 1
i 1
wish 1
cried 1
she 1
that 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
live 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
of 1
misery 1
justine 1
assumed 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
while 1
she 1
with 1
difficulty 1
repressed 1
her 1
bitter 1
tears 1
she 1
embraced 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
of 1
halfsuppressed 1
emotion 1
farewell 1
sweet 1
lady 1
dearest 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
beloved 1
and 1
only 1
friend 1
may 1
heaven 1
in 1
its 1
bounty 1
bless 1
and 1
preserve 1
you 1
may 1
this 1
be 1
the 1
last 1
misfortune 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
ever 1
suffer 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
make 1
others 1
so 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
justine 1
died 1
elizabeths 1
heartrending 1
eloquence 1
failed 1
to 1
move 1
the 1
judges 1
from 1
their 1
settled 1
conviction 1
in 1
the 1
criminality 1
of 1
the 1
saintly 1
sufferer 1
my 1
passionate 1
and 1
indignant 1
appeals 1
were 1
lost 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
received 1
their 1
cold 1
answers 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
harsh 1
unfeeling 1
reasoning 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
my 1
purposed 1
avowal 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
thus 1
i 1
might 1
proclaim 1
myself 1
a 1
madman 1
but 1
not 1
revoke 1
the 1
sentence 1
passed 1
upon 1
my 1
wretched 1
victim 1
she 1
perished 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
as 1
a 1
murderess 1
from 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
i 1
turned 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
voiceless 1
grief 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
this 1
also 1
was 1
my 1
doing 1

my 1
fathers 1
woe 1
and 1
the 1
desolation 1
of 1
that 1

these 1

up 1

of 1

calmness 1

i 1
was 1
alive 1
the 1

a 1
weight 1
of 1
despair 1

on 1
my 1
heart 1

nothing 1

from 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1

like 1
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
for 1
i 1

committed 1
deeds 1
of 1
mischief 1
beyond 1

the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
life 1
with 1
benevolent 1
intentions 1
and 1
thirsted 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
practice 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
now 1
all 1
was 1
blasted 1
instead 1
of 1
that 1
serenity 1
of 1
conscience 1
which 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
look 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
past 1
with 1
selfsatisfaction 1
and 1
from 1
thence 1
to 1
gather 1
promise 1
of 1
new 1
hopes 1
i 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
remorse 1
and 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
guilt 1
which 1
hurried 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
hell 1
of 1
intense 1
tortures 1
such 1
as 1
no 1
language 1
can 1
describe 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
perhaps 1
never 1
entirely 1
recovered 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
shock 1
it 1
had 1
sustained 1
i 1
shunned 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
all 1
sound 1
of 1
joy 1

complacency 1

torture 1
to 1

my 1
only 1
consolationdeep 1
dark 1
deathlike 1
solitude 1
my 1
father 1
observed 1
with 1
pain 1
the 1
alteration 1
perceptible 1
in 1
my 1
disposition 1
and 1
habits 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
arguments 1
deduced 1
from 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
his 1
serene 1
conscience 1
and 1
guiltless 1
life 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
fortitude 1
and 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
dispel 1
the 1
dark 1
cloud 1
which 1
brooded 1
over 1

you 1
think 1
victor 1

he 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
suffer 1
also 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
love 1
a 1
child 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
loved 1
your 1
brothertears 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
spokebut 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
duty 1
to 1
the 1
survivors 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
refrain 1
from 1
augmenting 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
immoderate 1
grief 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
duty 1
owed 1
to 1
yourself 1
for 1
excessive 1
sorrow 1
prevents 1
improvement 1
or 1
enjoyment 1
or 1
even 1
the 1
discharge 1
of 1
daily 1
usefulness 1
without 1
which 1
no 1
man 1
is 1
fit 1
for 1
society 1
this 1
advice 1
although 1
good 1
was 1
totally 1
inapplicable 1
to 1
my 1
case 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
hide 1
my 1
grief 1
and 1
console 1
my 1
friends 1
if 1
remorse 1
had 1
not 1
mingled 1
its 1
bitterness 1
and 1
terror 1
its 1
alarm 1
with 1
my 1
other 1
sensations 1
now 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
answer 1
my 1
father 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
hide 1
myself 1
from 1
his 1
view 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
at 1
belrive 1
this 1
change 1
was 1
particularly 1
agreeable 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
shutting 1
of 1
the 1
gates 1
regularly 1
at 1
ten 1
oclock 1
and 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
remaining 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
after 1
that 1
hour 1
had 1
rendered 1
our 1
residence 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
geneva 1
very 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
free 1
often 1
after 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
had 1
retired 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
passed 1
many 1
hours 1
upon 1
the 1
water 1
sometimes 1
with 1
my 1
sails 1
set 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
sometimes 1
after 1
rowing 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
boat 1
to 1
pursue 1
its 1
own 1
course 1
and 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
miserable 1
reflections 1
i 1
was 1
often 1
tempted 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
only 1
unquiet 1
thing 1
that 1
wandered 1
restless 1
in 1
a 1
scene 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
heavenlyif 1
i 1
except 1
some 1
bat 1
or 1
the 1
frogs 1
whose 1
harsh 1
and 1
interrupted 1
croaking 1
was 1
heard 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
shoreoften 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
was 1
tempted 1
to 1
plunge 1
into 1
the 1
silent 1
lake 1
that 1
the 1
waters 1
might 1
close 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
calamities 1
forever 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
restrained 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
heroic 1
and 1
suffering 1
elizabeth 1
whom 1
i 1
tenderly 1
loved 1
and 1
whose 1
existence 1
was 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
mine 1
i 1
thought 1
also 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
surviving 1
brother 1
should 1
i 1
by 1
my 1
base 1
desertion 1
leave 1
them 1
exposed 1
and 1
unprotected 1
to 1
the 1
malice 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
among 1
them 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
peace 1
would 1
revisit 1
my 1
mind 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
afford 1
them 1
consolation 1
and 1
happiness 1
but 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
remorse 1
extinguished 1
every 1
hope 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
unalterable 1
evils 1
and 1
i 1
lived 1
in 1
daily 1
fear 1
lest 1
the 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
should 1
perpetrate 1
some 1
new 1
wickedness 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
obscure 1
feeling 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
over 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
commit 1
some 1
signal 1
crime 1
which 1
by 1
its 1
enormity 1
should 1
almost 1
efface 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
there 1
was 1
always 1
scope 1
for 1
fear 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
anything 1
i 1
loved 1
remained 1
behind 1
my 1
abhorrence 1
of 1
this 1
fiend 1
cannot 1
be 1
conceived 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
i 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
inflamed 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
wished 1
to 1
extinguish 1
that 1
life 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
thoughtlessly 1
bestowed 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
malice 1
my 1
hatred 1
and 1
revenge 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
moderation 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
peak 1
of 1
the 1
andes 1
could 1
i 1
when 1
there 1
have 1
precipitated 1
him 1
to 1
their 1
base 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
wreak 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
abhorrence 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
avenge 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
justine 1
our 1
house 1
was 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
my 1
fathers 1
health 1
was 1
deeply 1
shaken 1
by 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
the 1
recent 1
events 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
sad 1
and 1
desponding 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
took 1
delight 1
in 1
her 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
all 1
pleasure 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
sacrilege 1
toward 1
the 1
dead 1
eternal 1
woe 1
and 1
tears 1
she 1
then 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
just 1
tribute 1
she 1
should 1
pay 1
to 1
innocence 1
so 1
blasted 1
and 1
destroyed 1
she 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
that 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
in 1
earlier 1
youth 1
wandered 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
of 1
our 1
future 1
prospects 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
those 1
sorrows 1
which 1
are 1
sent 1
to 1
wean 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
earth 1
had 1
visited 1
her 1
and 1
its 1
dimming 1
influence 1
quenched 1
her 1
dearest 1
smiles 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
on 1
the 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
justine 1
moritz 1
i 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
works 1
as 1
they 1
before 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
before 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
injustice 1
that 1
i 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
or 1
heard 1
from 1
others 1
as 1
tales 1
of 1
ancient 1
days 1
or 1
imaginary 1
evils 1
at 1
least 1
they 1
were 1
remote 1
and 1
more 1
familiar 1
to 1
reason 1
than 1
to 1
the 1
imagination 1
but 1
now 1
misery 1
has 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
men 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
monsters 1
thirsting 1
for 1
each 1
others 1
blood 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
certainly 1
unjust 1
everybody 1
believed 1
that 1
poor 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
guilty 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
committed 1
the 1
crime 1
for 1
which 1
she 1
suffered 1
assuredly 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
most 1
depraved 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
to 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
her 1
benefactor 1
and 1
friend 1
a 1
child 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
nursed 1
from 1
its 1
birth 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
love 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
own 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
any 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
certainly 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
unfit 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
feel 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
opinion 1
and 1
that 1
confirms 1
me 1
alas 1
victor 1
when 1
falsehood 1
can 1
look 1
so 1
like 1
the 1
truth 1
who 1
can 1
assure 1
themselves 1
of 1
certain 1
happiness 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
walking 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
precipice 1
towards 1
which 1
thousands 1
are 1
crowding 1

endeavouring 1

this 1

with 1
the 1
extremest 1
agony 1

not 1

read 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
and 1
kindly 1
taking 1
my 1
hand 1
said 1
my 1
dearest 1
friend 1
you 1
must 1
calm 1
yourself 1
these 1
events 1
have 1
affected 1
me 1
god 1
knows 1
how 1
deeply 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
wretched 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
sometimes 1
of 1
revenge 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
tremble 1
dear 1
victor 1
banish 1
these 1
dark 1
passions 1
remember 1
the 1
friends 1
around 1
you 1
who 1
centre 1
all 1
their 1
hopes 1
in 1
you 1
have 1
we 1
lost 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
rendering 1
you 1
happy 1
ah 1
while 1
we 1
love 1
while 1
we 1
are 1
true 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
land 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
beauty 1

native 1
country 1
we 1
may 1
reap 1
every 1
tranquil 1
blessingwhat 1
can 1
disturb 1
our 1
peace 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
such 1
words 1
from 1
her 1
whom 1
i 1
fondly 1
prized 1
before 1
every 1
other 1
gift 1
of 1
fortune 1
suffice 1
to 1
chase 1
away 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
lurked 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
even 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
i 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
terror 1
lest 1
at 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
the 1
destroyer 1
had 1
been 1
near 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
thus 1
not 1
the 1
tenderness 1
of 1
friendship 1
nor 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
earth 1
nor 1
of 1
heaven 1
could 1
redeem 1
my 1
soul 1
from 1
woe 1
the 1
very 1
accents 1
of 1
love 1
were 1
ineffectual 1
i 1
was 1
encompassed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
which 1
no 1
beneficial 1
influence 1
could 1
penetrate 1
the 1
wounded 1
deer 1
dragging 1
its 1
fainting 1
limbs 1
to 1
some 1
untrodden 1
brake 1
there 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
the 1
arrow 1
which 1
had 1
pierced 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
die 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
could 1
cope 1
with 1
the 1
sullen 1
despair 1
that 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
sometimes 1
the 1
whirlwind 1
passions 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
drove 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
and 1
by 1
change 1
of 1
place 1
some 1
relief 1
from 1
my 1
intolerable 1
sensations 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
an 1
access 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
that 1
i 1
suddenly 1
left 1
my 1
home 1
and 1
bending 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
near 1
alpine 1
valleys 1
sought 1
in 1
the 1
magnificence 1
the 1
eternity 1
of 1
such 1
scenes 1
to 1
forget 1
myself 1
and 1
my 1
ephemeral 1
because 1
human 1
sorrows 1
my 1
wanderings 1
were 1
directed 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
chamounix 1
i 1
had 1
visited 1
it 1
frequently 1
during 1
my 1
boyhood 1
six 1
years 1
had 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
_i_ 1
was 1
a 1
wreck 1
but 1
nought 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
those 1
savage 1
and 1
enduring 1
scenes 1
i 1
performed 1
the 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
on 1
horseback 1
i 1
afterwards 1
hired 1
a 1
mule 1
as 1
the 1
more 1
surefooted 1
and 1
least 1
liable 1
to 1
receive 1
injury 1
on 1
these 1
rugged 1
roads 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
fine 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
august 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
justine 1
that 1
miserable 1
epoch 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
dated 1
all 1
my 1
woe 1
the 1
weight 1
upon 1
my 1
spirit 1
was 1
sensibly 1
lightened 1
as 1
i 1
plunged 1
yet 1
deeper 1
in 1
the 1
ravine 1
of 1
arve 1
the 1
immense 1
mountains 1
and 1
precipices 1
that 1
overhung 1
me 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
raging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waterfalls 1
around 1
spoke 1
of 1
a 1
power 1
mighty 1
as 1
omnipotenceand 1
i 1
ceased 1
to 1
fear 1
or 1
to 1
bend 1
before 1
any 1
being 1
less 1
almighty 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
had 1
created 1
and 1
ruled 1
the 1
elements 1
here 1
displayed 1
in 1
their 1
most 1
terrific 1
guise 1
still 1
as 1
i 1
ascended 1
higher 1
the 1
valley 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
magnificent 1
and 1
astonishing 1
character 1
ruined 1

hanging 1
on 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
piny 1
mountains 1
the 1
impetuous 1
arve 1
and 1
cottages 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
peeping 1
forth 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
formed 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
singular 1
beauty 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
augmented 1
and 1
rendered 1
sublime 1
by 1
the 1
mighty 1
alps 1
whose 1
white 1
and 1
shining 1
pyramids 1
and 1
domes 1
towered 1
above 1
all 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
another 1
earth 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
another 1
race 1
of 1
beings 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
bridge 1
of 1
pelissier 1
where 1
the 1
ravine 1
which 1
the 1
river 1
forms 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
ascend 1
the 1
mountain 1
that 1
overhangs 1
it 1
soon 1
after 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
chamounix 1
this 1
valley 1
is 1
more 1
wonderful 1
and 1
sublime 1
but 1
not 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
picturesque 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
servox 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
passed 1
the 1
high 1
and 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
were 1
its 1
immediate 1
boundaries 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
more 1
ruined 1
castles 1
and 1
fertile 1
fields 1
immense 1
glaciers 1
approached 1
the 1
road 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
rumbling 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
avalanche 1
and 1
marked 1
the 1
smoke 1
of 1
its 1
passage 1
mont 1
blanc 1
the 1
supreme 1
and 1
magnificent 1
mont 1
blanc 1
raised 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
surrounding 1
aiguilles 1
and 1
its 1
tremendous 1
dome 1
overlooked 1
the 1
valley 1
a 1
tingling 1
longlost 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
often 1
came 1
across 1
me 1
during 1
this 1
journey 1
some 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
some 1
new 1
object 1
suddenly 1
perceived 1
and 1
recognized 1
reminded 1
me 1
of 1
days 1
gone 1
by 1
and 1
were 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
lighthearted 1
gaiety 1
of 1
boyhood 1
the 1
very 1
winds 1
whispered 1
in 1
soothing 1
accents 1
and 1
maternal 1
nature 1
bade 1
me 1
weep 1
no 1
more 1
then 1
again 1
the 1
kindly 1
influence 1
ceased 1
to 1
acti 1
found 1
myself 1
fettered 1
again 1
to 1
grief 1
and 1
indulging 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
reflection 1
then 1
i 1
spurred 1
on 1
my 1
animal 1
striving 1
so 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
world 1
my 1
fears 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
myselfor 1
in 1
a 1
more 1
desperate 1
fashion 1
i 1
alighted 1
and 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
weighed 1
down 1
by 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
chamounix 1
exhaustion 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
fatigue 1
both 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
of 1
mind 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
endured 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
i 1
remained 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
watching 1
the 1
pallid 1
lightnings 1
that 1
played 1
above 1
mont 1
blanc 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rushing 1
of 1
the 1
arve 1
which 1
pursued 1
its 1
noisy 1
way 1
beneath 1
the 1
same 1
lulling 1
sounds 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
lullaby 1
to 1
my 1
too 1
keen 1
sensations 1
when 1
i 1
placed 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
pillow 1
sleep 1
crept 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
came 1
and 1
blessed 1
the 1
giver 1
of 1
oblivion 1

i 1
spent 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
roaming 1
through 1
the 1
valley 1
i 1
stood 1
beside 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
the 1
arveiron 1
which 1
take 1
their 1
rise 1
in 1
a 1
glacier 1
that 1
with 1
slow 1
pace 1
is 1
advancing 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
barricade 1
the 1
valley 1
the 1
abrupt 1
sides 1
of 1
vast 1
mountains 1
were 1
before 1
me 1
the 1
icy 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
glacier 1
overhung 1
me 1
a 1
few 1
shattered 1
pines 1
were 1
scattered 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
solemn 1
silence 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
presencechamber 1
of 1
imperial 1
nature 1
was 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
brawling 1
waves 1
or 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
some 1
vast 1
fragment 1
the 1
thunder 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
avalanche 1
or 1
the 1
cracking 1
reverberated 1
along 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
the 1
accumulated 1
ice 1
which 1
through 1
the 1
silent 1
working 1
of 1
immutable 1
laws 1
was 1
ever 1
and 1
anon 1
rent 1
and 1
torn 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
a 1
plaything 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
these 1
sublime 1
and 1
magnificent 1
scenes 1
afforded 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
consolation 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
they 1
elevated 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
littleness 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
although 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
remove 1
my 1
grief 1
they 1
subdued 1
and 1
tranquillized 1
it 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
also 1
they 1
diverted 1
my 1
mind 1
from 1
the 1
thoughts 1
over 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
brooded 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
month 1
i 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
at 1
night 1
my 1
slumbers 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
waited 1
on 1
and 1
ministered 1
to 1
by 1
the 1
assemblance 1
of 1
grand 1
shapes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
contemplated 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
they 1
congregated 1
round 1
me 1
the 1
unstained 1
snowy 1
mountaintop 1
the 1
glittering 1
pinnacle 1
the 1
pine 1
woods 1
and 1
ragged 1
bare 1
ravine 1
the 1
eagle 1
soaring 1
amidst 1
the 1
cloudsthey 1
all 1
gathered 1
round 1
me 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
where 1
had 1
they 1
fled 1
when 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
awoke 1
all 1
of 1
soulinspiriting 1
fled 1
with 1
sleep 1
and 1
dark 1
melancholy 1
clouded 1
every 1
thought 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
pouring 1
in 1
torrents 1
and 1
thick 1
mists 1
hid 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
even 1
saw 1
not 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
those 1
mighty 1
friends 1
still 1
i 1
would 1
penetrate 1
their 1
misty 1
veil 1
and 1
seek 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
cloudy 1
retreats 1
what 1
were 1
rain 1
and 1
storm 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
mule 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
ascend 1
to 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
montanvert 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
and 1
evermoving 1
glacier 1
had 1
produced 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
it 1
it 1
had 1
then 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sublime 1
ecstasy 1
that 1
gave 1
wings 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
soar 1
from 1
the 1
obscure 1
world 1
to 1
light 1
and 1
joy 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
and 1
majestic 1
in 1
nature 1
had 1
indeed 1
always 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
solemnizing 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
causing 1
me 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
passing 1
cares 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
without 1
a 1
guide 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
another 1
would 1
destroy 1
the 1
solitary 1
grandeur 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
the 1
ascent 1
is 1
precipitous 1
but 1
the 1
path 1
is 1
cut 1
into 1
continual 1
and 1
short 1
windings 1
which 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
surmount 1
the 1
perpendicularity 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
scene 1
terrifically 1
desolate 1
in 1
a 1
thousand 1
spots 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
winter 1
avalanche 1
may 1
be 1
perceived 1
where 1
trees 1
lie 1
broken 1
and 1
strewed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
some 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
others 1
bent 1
leaning 1
upon 1
the 1
jutting 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
or 1
transversely 1
upon 1
other 1
trees 1
the 1
path 1
as 1
you 1
ascend 1
higher 1
is 1
intersected 1
by 1
ravines 1
of 1
snow 1
down 1
which 1
stones 1
continually 1
roll 1
from 1
above 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
is 1
particularly 1
dangerous 1
as 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
speaking 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
produces 1
a 1
concussion 1
of 1
air 1
sufficient 1
to 1
draw 1
destruction 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
speaker 1
the 1
pines 1
are 1
not 1
tall 1
or 1
luxuriant 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
sombre 1
and 1
add 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
severity 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
valley 1
beneath 1
vast 1
mists 1
were 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
rivers 1
which 1
ran 1
through 1
it 1
and 1
curling 1
in 1
thick 1
wreaths 1
around 1
the 1
opposite 1
mountains 1
whose 1
summits 1
were 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
uniform 1
clouds 1
while 1
rain 1
poured 1
from 1
the 1
dark 1
sky 1
and 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
melancholy 1
impression 1
i 1
received 1
from 1
the 1
objects 1
around 1
me 1
alas 1
why 1
does 1
man 1
boast 1
of 1
sensibilities 1
superior 1
to 1
those 1
apparent 1
in 1
the 1
brute 1
it 1
only 1
renders 1
them 1
more 1
necessary 1
beings 1
if 1
our 1
impulses 1
were 1
confined 1
to 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
desire 1
we 1
might 1
be 1
nearly 1
free 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
are 1
moved 1
by 1
every 1
wind 1
that 1
blows 1
and 1
a 1
chance 1
word 1
or 1
scene 1
that 1
that 1
word 1
may 1
convey 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
rest 1
a 1
dream 1
has 1
power 1
to 1
poison 1
sleep 1
we 1
rise 1
one 1
wandring 1
thought 1
pollutes 1
the 1
day 1
we 1
feel 1
conceive 1
or 1
reason 1
laugh 1
or 1
weep 1
embrace 1
fond 1
woe 1
or 1
cast 1
our 1
cares 1
away 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
same 1
for 1
be 1
it 1
joy 1
or 1
sorrow 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
its 1
departure 1
still 1
is 1
free 1
mans 1
yesterday 1
may 1
neer 1
be 1
like 1
his 1
morrow 1
nought 1
may 1
endure 1
but 1
mutability 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
noon 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
ascent 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
i 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
rock 1
that 1
overlooks 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
a 1
mist 1
covered 1
both 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
surrounding 1
mountains 1
presently 1
a 1
breeze 1
dissipated 1
the 1
cloud 1
and 1
i 1
descended 1
upon 1
the 1
glacier 1
the 1
surface 1
is 1
very 1
uneven 1
rising 1
like 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
a 1
troubled 1
sea 1
descending 1
low 1
and 1
interspersed 1
by 1
rifts 1
that 1
sink 1
deep 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
ice 1
is 1
almost 1
a 1
league 1
in 1
width 1
but 1
i 1
spent 1
nearly 1
two 1
hours 1
in 1
crossing 1
it 1
the 1
opposite 1
mountain 1
is 1
a 1
bare 1
perpendicular 1
rock 1
from 1
the 1
side 1
where 1
i 1
now 1
stood 1
montanvert 1
was 1
exactly 1
opposite 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
a 1
league 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
rose 1
mont 1
blanc 1
in 1
awful 1
majesty 1
i 1
remained 1
in 1
a 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
gazing 1
on 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
stupendous 1
scene 1
the 1
sea 1
or 1
rather 1
the 1
vast 1
river 1
of 1
ice 1
wound 1
among 1
its 1
dependent 1
mountains 1
whose 1
aerial 1
summits 1
hung 1
over 1
its 1
recesses 1
their 1
icy 1
and 1
glittering 1
peaks 1
shone 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
over 1
the 1
clouds 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
was 1
before 1
sorrowful 1
now 1
swelled 1
with 1
something 1
like 1
joy 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
wandering 1
spirits 1
if 1
indeed 1
ye 1
wander 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
rest 1
in 1
your 1
narrow 1
beds 1
allow 1
me 1
this 1
faint 1
happiness 1
or 1
take 1
me 1
as 1
your 1
companion 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
joys 1
of 1
life 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
i 1
suddenly 1
beheld 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
advancing 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
superhuman 1
speed 1
he 1
bounded 1
over 1
the 1
crevices 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
among 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
walked 1
with 1
caution 1
his 1
stature 1
also 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
seemed 1
to 1
exceed 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
troubled 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
faintness 1
seize 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
quickly 1
restored 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
gale 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
i 1
perceived 1
as 1
the 1
shape 1
came 1
nearer 1
sight 1
tremendous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
trembled 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
horror 1
resolving 1
to 1
wait 1
his 1
approach 1
and 1
then 1
close 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
combat 1
he 1
approached 1
his 1
countenance 1
bespoke 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
combined 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
malignity 1
while 1
its 1
unearthly 1
ugliness 1
rendered 1
it 1
almost 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
but 1
i 1
scarcely 1
observed 1
this 1
rage 1
and 1
hatred 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
deprived 1
me 1
of 1
utterance 1
and 1
i 1
recovered 1
only 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
him 1
with 1
words 1
expressive 1
of 1
furious 1
detestation 1
and 1
contempt 1
devil 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
approach 1
me 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
fear 1
the 1
fierce 1
vengeance 1
of 1
my 1
arm 1
wreaked 1
on 1
your 1
miserable 1
head 1
begone 1
vile 1
insect 1
or 1
rather 1
stay 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
trample 1
you 1
to 1
dust 1
and 1
oh 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
the 1
extinction 1
of 1
your 1
miserable 1
existence 1
restore 1
those 1
victims 1
whom 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
diabolically 1
murdered 1
i 1
expected 1
this 1
reception 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
all 1
men 1
hate 1
the 1
wretched 1
how 1
then 1
must 1
i 1
be 1
hated 1
who 1
am 1
miserable 1
beyond 1
all 1
living 1
things 1
yet 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
detest 1
and 1
spurn 1
me 1
thy 1
creature 1
to 1
whom 1
thou 1
art 1
bound 1
by 1
ties 1
only 1
dissoluble 1
by 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
you 1
purpose 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
sport 1
thus 1
with 1
life 1
do 1
your 1
duty 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
mine 1
towards 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
mankind 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
conditions 1
i 1
will 1
leave 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
at 1
peace 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
refuse 1
i 1
will 1
glut 1
the 1
maw 1
of 1
death 1
until 1
it 1
be 1
satiated 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
your 1
remaining 1
friends 1
abhorred 1
monster 1
fiend 1
that 1
thou 1
art 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
hell 1
are 1
too 1
mild 1
a 1
vengeance 1
for 1
thy 1
crimes 1
wretched 1
devil 1
you 1
reproach 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
creation 1
come 1
on 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
negligently 1
bestowed 1
my 1
rage 1
was 1
without 1
bounds 1
i 1
sprang 1
on 1
him 1
impelled 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
feelings 1
which 1
can 1
arm 1
one 1
being 1
against 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
another 1
he 1
easily 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
be 1
calm 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
me 1
before 1
you 1
give 1
vent 1
to 1
your 1
hatred 1
on 1
my 1
devoted 1
head 1
have 1
i 1
not 1
suffered 1
enough 1
that 1
you 1
seek 1
to 1
increase 1
my 1
misery 1
life 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
only 1
be 1
an 1
accumulation 1
of 1
anguish 1
is 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
defend 1
it 1
remember 1
thou 1
hast 1
made 1
me 1
more 1
powerful 1
than 1
thyself 1
my 1
height 1
is 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
my 1
joints 1
more 1
supple 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
tempted 1
to 1
set 1
myself 1
in 1
opposition 1
to 1
thee 1
i 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
even 1
mild 1
and 1
docile 1
to 1
my 1
natural 1
lord 1
and 1
king 1
if 1
thou 1
wilt 1
also 1
perform 1
thy 1
part 1
the 1
which 1
thou 1
owest 1
me 1
oh 1
frankenstein 1
be 1
not 1
equitable 1
to 1
every 1
other 1
and 1
trample 1
upon 1
me 1
alone 1
to 1
whom 1
thy 1
justice 1
and 1
even 1
thy 1
clemency 1
and 1
affection 1
is 1
most 1
due 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
thy 1
adam 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
rather 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
whom 1
thou 1
drivest 1
from 1
joy 1
for 1
no 1
misdeed 1
everywhere 1
i 1
see 1
bliss 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
alone 1
am 1
irrevocably 1
excluded 1
i 1
was 1
benevolent 1
and 1
good 1
misery 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
fiend 1
make 1
me 1
happy 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
again 1
be 1
virtuous 1
begone 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
you 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
community 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
enemies 1
begone 1
or 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
our 1
strength 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
in 1
which 1
one 1
must 1
fall 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
move 1
thee 1
will 1
no 1
entreaties 1
cause 1
thee 1
to 1
turn 1
a 1
favourable 1
eye 1
upon 1
thy 1
creature 1
who 1
implores 1
thy 1
goodness 1
and 1
compassion 1
believe 1
me 1
frankenstein 1
i 1
was 1
benevolent 1
my 1
soul 1
glowed 1
with 1
love 1
and 1
humanity 1
but 1
am 1
i 1
not 1
alone 1
miserably 1
alone 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
abhor 1
me 1
what 1
hope 1
can 1
i 1
gather 1
from 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
who 1
owe 1
me 1
nothing 1
they 1
spurn 1
and 1
hate 1
me 1
the 1
desert 1
mountains 1
and 1
dreary 1
glaciers 1
are 1
my 1
refuge 1
i 1
have 1
wandered 1
here 1
many 1
days 1
the 1
caves 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
i 1
only 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
are 1
a 1
dwelling 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
man 1
does 1
not 1
grudge 1
these 1
bleak 1
skies 1
i 1
hail 1
for 1
they 1
are 1
kinder 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
your 1
fellow 1
beings 1
if 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
mankind 1
knew 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
and 1
arm 1
themselves 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
shall 1
i 1
not 1
then 1
hate 1
them 1
who 1
abhor 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
no 1
terms 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
i 1
am 1
miserable 1
and 1
they 1
shall 1
share 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
recompense 1
me 1
and 1
deliver 1
them 1
from 1
an 1
evil 1
which 1
it 1
only 1
remains 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
but 1
thousands 1
of 1
others 1
shall 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
its 1
rage 1
let 1
your 1
compassion 1
be 1
moved 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
disdain 1
me 1
listen 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
abandon 1
or 1
commiserate 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
shall 1
judge 1
that 1
i 1
deserve 1
but 1
hear 1
me 1
the 1
guilty 1
are 1
allowed 1
by 1
human 1
laws 1
bloody 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
speak 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
defence 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
condemned 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
frankenstein 1
you 1
accuse 1
me 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
would 1
with 1
a 1
satisfied 1
conscience 1
destroy 1
your 1
own 1
creature 1
oh 1
praise 1
the 1
eternal 1
justice 1
of 1
man 1
yet 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
spare 1
me 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
hands 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
to 1
my 1
remembrance 1
i 1
rejoined 1
circumstances 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
miserable 1
origin 1
and 1
author 1
cursed 1
be 1
the 1
day 1
abhorred 1
devil 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
first 1
saw 1
light 1
cursed 1
although 1
i 1
curse 1
myself 1
be 1
the 1
hands 1
that 1
formed 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
beyond 1
expression 1
you 1
have 1
left 1
me 1
no 1
power 1
to 1
consider 1
whether 1
i 1
am 1
just 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
not 1
begone 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
your 1
detested 1
form 1
thus 1
i 1
relieve 1
thee 1
my 1
creator 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
placed 1
his 1
hated 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
i 1
flung 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
violence 1
thus 1
i 1
take 1
from 1
thee 1
a 1
sight 1
which 1
you 1
abhor 1
still 1
thou 1
canst 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
grant 1
me 1
thy 1
compassion 1
by 1
the 1
virtues 1
that 1
i 1
once 1
possessed 1
i 1
demand 1
this 1
from 1
you 1
hear 1
my 1
tale 1
it 1
is 1
long 1
and 1
strange 1
and 1
the 1
temperature 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
not 1
fitting 1
to 1
your 1
fine 1
sensations 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
mountain 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
yet 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
before 1
it 1
descends 1
to 1
hide 1
itself 1
behind 1
your 1
snowy 1
precipices 1
and 1
illuminate 1
another 1
world 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
can 1
decide 1
on 1
you 1
it 1
rests 1
whether 1
i 1
quit 1
forever 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
lead 1
a 1
harmless 1
life 1
or 1
become 1
the 1
scourge 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
and 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
speedy 1
ruin 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
i 1
followed 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
full 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
i 1
weighed 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
and 1
determined 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
his 1
tale 1
i 1
was 1
partly 1
urged 1
by 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
confirmed 1
my 1
resolution 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
supposed 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
i 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
a 1
confirmation 1
or 1
denial 1
of 1
this 1
opinion 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
also 1
i 1
felt 1
what 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
creator 1
towards 1
his 1
creature 1
were 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
render 1
him 1
happy 1
before 1
i 1
complained 1
of 1
his 1
wickedness 1
these 1
motives 1
urged 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
demand 1
we 1
crossed 1
the 1
ice 1
therefore 1
and 1
ascended 1
the 1
opposite 1
rock 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
descend 1
we 1
entered 1
the 1
hut 1
the 1
fiend 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
exultation 1
i 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
heart 1
and 1
depressed 1
spirits 1
but 1
i 1
consented 1
to 1
listen 1
and 1
seating 1
myself 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
my 1
odious 1
companion 1
had 1
lighted 1
he 1
thus 1
began 1
his 1
tale 1
chapter 1
11 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
that 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
original 1
era 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
all 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
that 1
period 1
appear 1
confused 1
and 1
indistinct 1
a 1
strange 1
multiplicity 1
of 1
sensations 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
felt 1
heard 1
and 1
smelt 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
i 1
learned 1
to 1
distinguish 1
between 1
the 1
operations 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
senses 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
remember 1
a 1
stronger 1
light 1
pressed 1
upon 1
my 1
nerves 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
darkness 1
then 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
troubled 1
me 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
i 1
felt 1
this 1
when 1
by 1
opening 1
my 1
eyes 1
as 1
i 1
now 1
suppose 1
the 1
light 1
poured 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
again 1
i 1
walked 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
descended 1
but 1
i 1
presently 1
found 1
a 1
great 1
alteration 1
in 1
my 1
sensations 1
before 1
dark 1
and 1
opaque 1
bodies 1
had 1
surrounded 1
me 1
impervious 1
to 1
my 1
touch 1
or 1
sight 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
wander 1
on 1
at 1
liberty 1
with 1
no 1
obstacles 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
either 1
surmount 1
or 1
avoid 1
the 1
light 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
oppressive 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
heat 1
wearying 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
walked 1
i 1
sought 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
receive 1
shade 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
forest 1
near 1
ingolstadt 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
lay 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
brook 1
resting 1
from 1
my 1
fatigue 1
until 1
i 1
felt 1
tormented 1
by 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
this 1
roused 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
nearly 1
dormant 1
state 1
and 1
i 1
ate 1
some 1
berries 1
which 1
i 1
found 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
slaked 1
my 1
thirst 1
at 1
the 1
brook 1
and 1
then 1
lying 1
down 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
felt 1
cold 1
also 1
and 1
half 1
frightened 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
instinctively 1
finding 1
myself 1
so 1
desolate 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
quitted 1
your 1
apartment 1
on 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
cold 1
i 1
had 1
covered 1
myself 1
with 1
some 1
clothes 1
but 1
these 1
were 1
insufficient 1
to 1
secure 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
helpless 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
i 1
knew 1
and 1
could 1
distinguish 1
nothing 1
but 1
feeling 1
pain 1
invade 1
me 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
soon 1
a 1
gentle 1
light 1
stole 1
over 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
pleasure 1
i 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
beheld 1
a 1
radiant 1
form 1
rise 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
the 1
moon 1
i 1
gazed 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
wonder 1
it 1
moved 1
slowly 1
but 1
it 1
enlightened 1
my 1
path 1
and 1
i 1
again 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
berries 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
cold 1
when 1
under 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
huge 1
cloak 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
covered 1
myself 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
no 1
distinct 1
ideas 1
occupied 1
my 1
mind 1
all 1
was 1
confused 1
i 1
felt 1
light 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
and 1
darkness 1
innumerable 1
sounds 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
various 1
scents 1
saluted 1
me 1
the 1
only 1
object 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
was 1
the 1
bright 1
moon 1
and 1
i 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
that 1
with 1
pleasure 1
several 1
changes 1
of 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
orb 1
of 1
night 1
had 1
greatly 1
lessened 1
when 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
distinguish 1
my 1
sensations 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
i 1
gradually 1
saw 1
plainly 1
the 1
clear 1
stream 1
that 1
supplied 1
me 1
with 1
drink 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
me 1
with 1
their 1
foliage 1
i 1
was 1
delighted 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
discovered 1
that 1
a 1
pleasant 1
sound 1
which 1
often 1
saluted 1
my 1
ears 1
proceeded 1
from 1
the 1
throats 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
winged 1
animals 1
who 1
had 1
often 1
intercepted 1
the 1
light 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
began 1
also 1
to 1
observe 1
with 1
greater 1
accuracy 1
the 1
forms 1
that 1
surrounded 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
the 1
boundaries 1
of 1
the 1
radiant 1
roof 1
of 1
light 1
which 1
canopied 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
imitate 1
the 1
pleasant 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
sometimes 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mode 1
but 1
the 1
uncouth 1
and 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
which 1
broke 1
from 1
me 1
frightened 1
me 1
into 1
silence 1
again 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
disappeared 1
from 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
lessened 1
form 1
showed 1
itself 1
while 1
i 1
still 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
my 1
sensations 1
had 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
become 1
distinct 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
received 1
every 1
day 1
additional 1
ideas 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
objects 1
in 1
their 1
right 1
forms 1
i 1
distinguished 1
the 1
insect 1
from 1
the 1
herb 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
one 1
herb 1
from 1
another 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sparrow 1
uttered 1
none 1
but 1
harsh 1
notes 1
whilst 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
blackbird 1
and 1
thrush 1
were 1
sweet 1
and 1
enticing 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
cold 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
fire 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
by 1
some 1
wandering 1
beggars 1
and 1
was 1
overcome 1
with 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
warmth 1
i 1
experienced 1
from 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
joy 1
i 1
thrust 1
my 1
hand 1
into 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
but 1
quickly 1
drew 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
how 1
strange 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
cause 1
should 1
produce 1
such 1
opposite 1
effects 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
materials 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
to 1
my 1
joy 1
found 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
composed 1
of 1
wood 1
i 1
quickly 1
collected 1
some 1
branches 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
wet 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
burn 1
i 1
was 1
pained 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
sat 1
still 1
watching 1
the 1
operation 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
the 1
wet 1
wood 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
near 1
the 1
heat 1
dried 1
and 1
itself 1
became 1
inflamed 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
this 1
and 1
by 1
touching 1
the 1
various 1
branches 1
i 1
discovered 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
busied 1
myself 1
in 1
collecting 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
wood 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
dry 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
plentiful 1
supply 1
of 1
fire 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
and 1
brought 1
sleep 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
fear 1
lest 1
my 1
fire 1
should 1
be 1
extinguished 1
i 1
covered 1
it 1
carefully 1
with 1
dry 1
wood 1
and 1
leaves 1
and 1
placed 1
wet 1
branches 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
spreading 1
my 1
cloak 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
sank 1
into 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
fire 1
i 1
uncovered 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
quickly 1
fanned 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
flame 1
i 1
observed 1
this 1
also 1
and 1
contrived 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
branches 1
which 1
roused 1
the 1
embers 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
nearly 1
extinguished 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
i 1
found 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
the 1
fire 1
gave 1
light 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
heat 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
this 1
element 1
was 1
useful 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
food 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
offals 1
that 1
the 1
travellers 1
had 1
left 1
had 1
been 1
roasted 1
and 1
tasted 1
much 1
more 1
savoury 1
than 1
the 1
berries 1
i 1
gathered 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
i 1
tried 1
therefore 1
to 1
dress 1
my 1
food 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
placing 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
berries 1
were 1
spoiled 1
by 1
this 1
operation 1
and 1
the 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
much 1
improved 1
food 1
however 1
became 1
scarce 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
searching 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
acorns 1
to 1
assuage 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
this 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
inhabited 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
one 1
where 1
the 1
few 1
wants 1
i 1
experienced 1
would 1
be 1
more 1
easily 1
satisfied 1
in 1
this 1
emigration 1
i 1
exceedingly 1
lamented 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
through 1
accident 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
how 1
to 1
reproduce 1
it 1
i 1
gave 1
several 1
hours 1
to 1
the 1
serious 1
consideration 1
of 1
this 1
difficulty 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
relinquish 1
all 1
attempt 1
to 1
supply 1
it 1
and 1
wrapping 1
myself 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
cloak 1
i 1
struck 1
across 1
the 1
wood 1
towards 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
i 1
passed 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
these 1
rambles 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
discovered 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
fall 1
of 1
snow 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
fields 1
were 1
of 1
one 1
uniform 1
white 1
the 1
appearance 1
was 1
disconsolate 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
feet 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
damp 1
substance 1
that 1
covered 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
seven 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
obtain 1
food 1
and 1
shelter 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
hut 1
on 1
a 1
rising 1
ground 1
which 1
had 1
doubtless 1
been 1
built 1
for 1
the 1
convenience 1
of 1
some 1
shepherd 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
sight 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
structure 1
with 1
great 1
curiosity 1
finding 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
i 1
entered 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
sat 1
in 1
it 1
near 1
a 1
fire 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
preparing 1
his 1
breakfast 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
hearing 1
a 1
noise 1
and 1
perceiving 1
me 1
shrieked 1
loudly 1
and 1
quitting 1
the 1
hut 1
ran 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
with 1
a 1
speed 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
debilitated 1
form 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
capable 1
his 1
appearance 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
seen 1
and 1
his 1
flight 1
somewhat 1
surprised 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
enchanted 1
by 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
here 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
could 1
not 1
penetrate 1
the 1
ground 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
it 1
presented 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
as 1
exquisite 1
and 1
divine 1
a 1
retreat 1
as 1
pandemonium 1
appeared 1
to 1
the 1
demons 1
of 1
hell 1
after 1
their 1
sufferings 1
in 1
the 1
lake 1
of 1
fire 1
i 1
greedily 1
devoured 1
the 1
remnants 1
of 1
the 1
shepherds 1
breakfast 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
bread 1
cheese 1
milk 1
and 1
wine 1
the 1
latter 1
however 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
then 1
overcome 1
by 1
fatigue 1
i 1
lay 1
down 1
among 1
some 1
straw 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
it 1
was 1
noon 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
allured 1
by 1
the 1
warmth 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
which 1
shone 1
brightly 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
ground 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
depositing 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
breakfast 1
in 1
a 1
wallet 1
i 1
found 1
i 1
proceeded 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
until 1
at 1
sunset 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
village 1
how 1
miraculous 1
did 1
this 1
appear 1
the 1
huts 1
the 1
neater 1
cottages 1
and 1
stately 1
houses 1
engaged 1
my 1
admiration 1
by 1
turns 1
the 1
vegetables 1
in 1
the 1
gardens 1
the 1
milk 1
and 1
cheese 1
that 1
i 1
saw 1
placed 1
at 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
cottages 1
allured 1
my 1
appetite 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
these 1
i 1
entered 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
hardly 1
placed 1
my 1
foot 1
within 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
the 1
children 1
shrieked 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
fainted 1
the 1
whole 1
village 1
was 1
roused 1
some 1
fled 1
some 1
attacked 1
me 1
until 1
grievously 1
bruised 1
by 1
stones 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
kinds 1
of 1
missile 1
weapons 1
i 1
escaped 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
and 1
fearfully 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
hovel 1
quite 1
bare 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
after 1
the 1
palaces 1
i 1
had 1
beheld 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
this 1
hovel 1
however 1
joined 1
a 1
cottage 1
of 1
a 1
neat 1
and 1
pleasant 1
appearance 1
but 1
after 1
my 1
late 1
dearly 1
bought 1
experience 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
enter 1
it 1
my 1
place 1
of 1
refuge 1
was 1
constructed 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
so 1
low 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
difficulty 1
sit 1
upright 1
in 1
it 1
no 1
wood 1
however 1
was 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
floor 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
wind 1
entered 1
it 1
by 1
innumerable 1
chinks 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
an 1
agreeable 1
asylum 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
here 1
then 1
i 1
retreated 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
shelter 1
however 1
miserable 1
from 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
from 1
the 1
barbarity 1
of 1
man 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
morning 1
dawned 1
i 1
crept 1
from 1
my 1
kennel 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
view 1
the 1
adjacent 1
cottage 1
and 1
discover 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
habitation 1
i 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
situated 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
surrounded 1
on 1
the 1
sides 1
which 1
were 1
exposed 1
by 1
a 1
pig 1
sty 1
and 1
a 1
clear 1
pool 1
of 1
water 1
one 1
part 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
crept 1
in 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
covered 1
every 1
crevice 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
perceived 1
with 1
stones 1
and 1
wood 1
yet 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
move 1
them 1
on 1
occasion 1
to 1
pass 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
light 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
sty 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
having 1
thus 1
arranged 1
my 1
dwelling 1
and 1
carpeted 1
it 1
with 1
clean 1
straw 1
i 1
retired 1
for 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
i 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
my 1
treatment 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
however 1
provided 1
for 1
my 1
sustenance 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
by 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
coarse 1
bread 1
which 1
i 1
purloined 1
and 1
a 1
cup 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
drink 1
more 1
conveniently 1
than 1
from 1
my 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
pure 1
water 1
which 1
flowed 1
by 1
my 1
retreat 1
the 1
floor 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
raised 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
kept 1
perfectly 1
dry 1
and 1
by 1
its 1
vicinity 1
to 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
tolerably 1
warm 1
being 1
thus 1
provided 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
reside 1
in 1
this 1
hovel 1
until 1
something 1
should 1
occur 1
which 1
might 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
paradise 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
bleak 1
forest 1
my 1
former 1
residence 1
the 1
raindropping 1
branches 1
and 1
dank 1
earth 1
i 1
ate 1
my 1
breakfast 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
remove 1
a 1
plank 1
to 1
procure 1
myself 1
a 1
little 1
water 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
looking 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
chink 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
young 1
creature 1
with 1
a 1
pail 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
passing 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
of 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
unlike 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
since 1
found 1
cottagers 1
and 1
farmhouse 1
servants 1
to 1
be 1
yet 1
she 1
was 1
meanly 1
dressed 1
a 1
coarse 1
blue 1
petticoat 1
and 1
a 1
linen 1
jacket 1
being 1
her 1
only 1
garb 1
her 1
fair 1
hair 1
was 1
plaited 1
but 1
not 1
adorned 1
she 1
looked 1
patient 1
yet 1
sad 1
i 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
she 1
returned 1
bearing 1
the 1
pail 1
which 1
was 1
now 1
partly 1
filled 1
with 1
milk 1
as 1
she 1
walked 1
along 1
seemingly 1
incommoded 1
by 1
the 1
burden 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
met 1
her 1
whose 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
a 1
deeper 1
despondence 1
uttering 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
melancholy 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pail 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
bore 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
himself 1
she 1
followed 1
and 1
they 1
disappeared 1
presently 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
again 1
with 1
some 1
tools 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
cross 1
the 1
field 1
behind 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
also 1
busied 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
on 1
examining 1
my 1
dwelling 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
had 1
formerly 1
occupied 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
panes 1
had 1
been 1
filled 1
up 1
with 1
wood 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
and 1
almost 1
imperceptible 1
chink 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
eye 1
could 1
just 1
penetrate 1
through 1
this 1
crevice 1
a 1
small 1
room 1
was 1
visible 1
whitewashed 1
and 1
clean 1
but 1
very 1
bare 1
of 1
furniture 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
near 1
a 1
small 1
fire 1
sat 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
a 1
disconsolate 1
attitude 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
but 1
presently 1
she 1
took 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
employed 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
taking 1
up 1
an 1
instrument 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
to 1
produce 1
sounds 1
sweeter 1
than 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
thrush 1
or 1
the 1
nightingale 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
sight 1
even 1
to 1
me 1
poor 1
wretch 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
beheld 1
aught 1
beautiful 1
before 1
the 1
silver 1
hair 1
and 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
the 1
aged 1
cottager 1
won 1
my 1
reverence 1
while 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
enticed 1
my 1
love 1
he 1
played 1
a 1
sweet 1
mournful 1
air 1
which 1
i 1
perceived 1
drew 1
tears 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
amiable 1
companion 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
until 1
she 1
sobbed 1
audibly 1
he 1
then 1
pronounced 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
and 1
the 1
fair 1
creature 1
leaving 1
her 1
work 1
knelt 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
smiled 1
with 1
such 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
sensations 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
and 1
overpowering 1
nature 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
pleasure 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
either 1
from 1
hunger 1
or 1
cold 1
warmth 1
or 1
food 1
and 1
i 1
withdrew 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
unable 1
to 1
bear 1
these 1
emotions 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
returned 1
bearing 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
the 1
girl 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
helped 1
to 1
relieve 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
burden 1
and 1
taking 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
fuel 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
placed 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
then 1
she 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
apart 1
into 1
a 1
nook 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
her 1
a 1
large 1
loaf 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cheese 1
she 1
seemed 1
pleased 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
for 1
some 1
roots 1
and 1
plants 1
which 1
she 1
placed 1
in 1
water 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
she 1
afterwards 1
continued 1
her 1
work 1
whilst 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
appeared 1
busily 1
employed 1
in 1
digging 1
and 1
pulling 1
up 1
roots 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
employed 1
thus 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
joined 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
together 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
been 1
pensive 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
he 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
air 1
and 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
meal 1
was 1
quickly 1
dispatched 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
was 1
again 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
walked 1
before 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
leaning 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
youth 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
in 1
beauty 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
these 1
two 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
one 1
was 1
old 1
with 1
silver 1
hairs 1
and 1
a 1
countenance 1
beaming 1
with 1
benevolence 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
younger 1
was 1
slight 1
and 1
graceful 1
in 1
his 1
figure 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
were 1
moulded 1
with 1
the 1
finest 1
symmetry 1
yet 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
attitude 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
sadness 1
and 1
despondency 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
with 1
tools 1
different 1
from 1
those 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
directed 1
his 1
steps 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
night 1
quickly 1
shut 1
in 1
but 1
to 1
my 1
extreme 1
wonder 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
cottagers 1
had 1
a 1
means 1
of 1
prolonging 1
light 1
by 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
tapers 1
and 1
was 1
delighted 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
setting 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
did 1
not 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
pleasure 1
i 1
experienced 1
in 1
watching 1
my 1
human 1
neighbours 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
and 1
her 1
companion 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
again 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
instrument 1
which 1
produced 1
the 1
divine 1
sounds 1
that 1
had 1
enchanted 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
youth 1
began 1
not 1
to 1
play 1
but 1
to 1
utter 1
sounds 1
that 1
were 1
monotonous 1
and 1
neither 1
resembling 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
mans 1
instrument 1
nor 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
i 1
since 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
read 1
aloud 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
words 1
or 1
letters 1
the 1
family 1
after 1
having 1
been 1
thus 1
occupied 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
extinguished 1
their 1
lights 1
and 1
retired 1
as 1
i 1
conjectured 1
to 1
rest 1
chapter 1
12 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
my 1
straw 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
what 1
chiefly 1
struck 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
these 1
people 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
join 1
them 1
but 1
dared 1
not 1
i 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
the 1
treatment 1
i 1
had 1
suffered 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
from 1
the 1
barbarous 1
villagers 1
and 1
resolved 1
whatever 1
course 1
of 1
conduct 1
i 1
might 1
hereafter 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
pursue 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
i 1
would 1
remain 1
quietly 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
watching 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
which 1
influenced 1
their 1
actions 1
the 1
cottagers 1
arose 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
arranged 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
prepared 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
departed 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
meal 1
this 1
day 1
was 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
routine 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
preceded 1
it 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
constantly 1
employed 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
in 1
various 1
laborious 1
occupations 1
within 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
whom 1
i 1
soon 1
perceived 1
to 1
be 1
blind 1
employed 1
his 1
leisure 1
hours 1
on 1
his 1
instrument 1
or 1
in 1
contemplation 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
respect 1
which 1
the 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
exhibited 1
towards 1
their 1
venerable 1
companion 1
they 1
performed 1
towards 1
him 1
every 1
little 1
office 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
duty 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
he 1
rewarded 1
them 1
by 1
his 1
benevolent 1
smiles 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
entirely 1
happy 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
often 1
went 1
apart 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
weep 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
deeply 1
affected 1
by 1
it 1
if 1
such 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
were 1
miserable 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
strange 1
that 1
i 1
an 1
imperfect 1
and 1
solitary 1
being 1
should 1
be 1
wretched 1
yet 1
why 1
were 1
these 1
gentle 1
beings 1
unhappy 1
they 1
possessed 1
a 1
delightful 1
house 1
for 1
such 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
every 1
luxury 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
fire 1
to 1
warm 1
them 1
when 1
chill 1
and 1
delicious 1
viands 1
when 1
hungry 1
they 1
were 1
dressed 1
in 1
excellent 1
clothes 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
they 1
enjoyed 1
one 1
anothers 1
company 1
and 1
speech 1
interchanging 1
each 1
day 1
looks 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
kindness 1
what 1
did 1
their 1
tears 1
imply 1
did 1
they 1
really 1
express 1
pain 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
these 1
questions 1
but 1
perpetual 1
attention 1
and 1
time 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
many 1
appearances 1
which 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
enigmatic 1
a 1
considerable 1
period 1
elapsed 1
before 1
i 1
discovered 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
the 1
uneasiness 1
of 1
this 1
amiable 1
family 1
it 1
was 1
poverty 1
and 1
they 1
suffered 1
that 1
evil 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
distressing 1
degree 1
their 1
nourishment 1
consisted 1
entirely 1
of 1
the 1
vegetables 1
of 1
their 1
garden 1
and 1
the 1
milk 1
of 1
one 1
cow 1
which 1
gave 1
very 1
little 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
when 1
its 1
masters 1
could 1
scarcely 1
procure 1
food 1
to 1
support 1
it 1
they 1
often 1
i 1
believe 1
suffered 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
very 1
poignantly 1
especially 1
the 1
two 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
for 1
several 1
times 1
they 1
placed 1
food 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
reserved 1
none 1
for 1
themselves 1
this 1
trait 1
of 1
kindness 1
moved 1
me 1
sensibly 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
steal 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
store 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
consumption 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
i 1
inflicted 1
pain 1
on 1
the 1
cottagers 1
i 1
abstained 1
and 1
satisfied 1
myself 1
with 1
berries 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
which 1
i 1
gathered 1
from 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
i 1
discovered 1
also 1
another 1
means 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
assist 1
their 1
labours 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
youth 1
spent 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
each 1
day 1
in 1
collecting 1
wood 1
for 1
the 1
family 1
fire 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
often 1
took 1
his 1
tools 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
sufficient 1
for 1
the 1
consumption 1
of 1
several 1
days 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
when 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
appeared 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
on 1
seeing 1
a 1
great 1
pile 1
of 1
wood 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
she 1
uttered 1
some 1
words 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
joined 1
her 1
who 1
also 1
expressed 1
surprise 1
i 1
observed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
that 1
day 1
but 1
spent 1
it 1
in 1
repairing 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
cultivating 1
the 1
garden 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
discovery 1
of 1
still 1
greater 1
moment 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
people 1
possessed 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
communicating 1
their 1
experience 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
by 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
spoke 1
sometimes 1
produced 1
pleasure 1
or 1
pain 1
smiles 1
or 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
and 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
hearers 1
this 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
godlike 1
science 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
baffled 1
in 1
every 1
attempt 1
i 1
made 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
their 1
pronunciation 1
was 1
quick 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
uttered 1
not 1
having 1
any 1
apparent 1
connection 1
with 1
visible 1
objects 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
discover 1
any 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
unravel 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
their 1
reference 1
by 1
great 1
application 1
however 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
several 1
revolutions 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
i 1
discovered 1
the 1
names 1
that 1
were 1
given 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
familiar 1
objects 1
of 1
discourse 1
i 1
learned 1
and 1
applied 1
the 1
words 1
fire 1
milk 1
bread 1
and 1
wood 1
i 1
learned 1
also 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
themselves 1
the 1
youth 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
several 1
names 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
was 1
father 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
called 1
sister 1
or 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
felix 1
brother 1
or 1
son 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
delight 1
i 1
felt 1
when 1
i 1
learned 1
the 1
ideas 1
appropriated 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
sounds 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
pronounce 1
them 1
i 1
distinguished 1
several 1
other 1
words 1
without 1
being 1
able 1
as 1
yet 1
to 1
understand 1
or 1
apply 1
them 1
such 1
as 1
good 1
dearest 1
unhappy 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
winter 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
greatly 1
endeared 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
unhappy 1
i 1
felt 1
depressed 1
when 1
they 1
rejoiced 1
i 1
sympathized 1
in 1
their 1
joys 1
i 1
saw 1
few 1
human 1
beings 1
besides 1
them 1
and 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
happened 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
cottage 1
their 1
harsh 1
manners 1
and 1
rude 1
gait 1
only 1
enhanced 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
superior 1
accomplishments 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
could 1
perceive 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
encourage 1
his 1
children 1
as 1
sometimes 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
to 1
cast 1
off 1
their 1
melancholy 1
he 1
would 1
talk 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
goodness 1
that 1
bestowed 1
pleasure 1
even 1
upon 1
me 1
agatha 1
listened 1
with 1
respect 1
her 1
eyes 1
sometimes 1
filled 1
with 1
tears 1
which 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
wipe 1
away 1
unperceived 1
but 1
i 1
generally 1
found 1
that 1
her 1
countenance 1
and 1
tone 1
were 1
more 1
cheerful 1
after 1
having 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
exhortations 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
thus 1
with 1
felix 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
saddest 1
of 1
the 1
group 1
and 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
unpractised 1
senses 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
suffered 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
his 1
friends 1
but 1
if 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
more 1
sorrowful 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
more 1
cheerful 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
sister 1
especially 1
when 1
he 1
addressed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
could 1
mention 1
innumerable 1
instances 1
which 1
although 1
slight 1
marked 1
the 1
dispositions 1
of 1
these 1
amiable 1
cottagers 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
felix 1
carried 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
white 1
flower 1
that 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
beneath 1
the 1
snowy 1
ground 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
she 1
had 1
risen 1
he 1
cleared 1
away 1
the 1
snow 1
that 1
obstructed 1
her 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
milkhouse 1
drew 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
wood 1
from 1
the 1
outhouse 1
where 1
to 1
his 1
perpetual 1
astonishment 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
store 1
always 1
replenished 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
worked 1
sometimes 1
for 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
farmer 1
because 1
he 1
often 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
until 1
dinner 1
yet 1
brought 1
no 1
wood 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
worked 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
frosty 1
season 1
he 1
read 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
agatha 1
this 1
reading 1
had 1
puzzled 1
me 1
extremely 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
uttered 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
sounds 1
when 1
he 1
read 1
as 1
when 1
he 1
talked 1
i 1
conjectured 1
therefore 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
paper 1
signs 1
for 1
speech 1
which 1
he 1
understood 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
longed 1
to 1
comprehend 1
these 1
also 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
that 1
possible 1
when 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
understand 1
the 1
sounds 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
stood 1
as 1
signs 1
i 1
improved 1
however 1
sensibly 1
in 1
this 1
science 1
but 1
not 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
follow 1
up 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
conversation 1
although 1
i 1
applied 1
my 1
whole 1
mind 1
to 1
the 1
endeavour 1
for 1
i 1
easily 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
i 1
eagerly 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
i 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
attempt 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
become 1
master 1
of 1
their 1
language 1
which 1
knowledge 1
might 1
enable 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
overlook 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
my 1
figure 1
for 1
with 1
this 1
also 1
the 1
contrast 1
perpetually 1
presented 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
acquainted 1
i 1
had 1
admired 1
the 1
perfect 1
forms 1
of 1
my 1
cottagerstheir 1
grace 1
beauty 1
and 1
delicate 1
complexions 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
i 1
terrified 1
when 1
i 1
viewed 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
transparent 1
pool 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
started 1
back 1
unable 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
i 1
who 1
was 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
became 1
fully 1
convinced 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
sensations 1
of 1
despondence 1
and 1
mortification 1
alas 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
yet 1
entirely 1
know 1
the 1
fatal 1
effects 1
of 1
this 1
miserable 1
deformity 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
longer 1
the 1
snow 1
vanished 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
earth 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
felix 1
was 1
more 1
employed 1
and 1
the 1
heartmoving 1
indications 1
of 1
impending 1
famine 1
disappeared 1
their 1
food 1
as 1
i 1
afterwards 1
found 1
was 1
coarse 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
wholesome 1
and 1
they 1
procured 1
a 1
sufficiency 1
of 1
it 1
several 1
new 1
kinds 1
of 1
plants 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
which 1
they 1
dressed 1
and 1
these 1
signs 1
of 1
comfort 1
increased 1
daily 1
as 1
the 1
season 1
advanced 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
on 1
his 1
son 1
walked 1
each 1
day 1
at 1
noon 1
when 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
rain 1
as 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
when 1
the 1
heavens 1
poured 1
forth 1
its 1
waters 1
this 1
frequently 1
took 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
high 1
wind 1
quickly 1
dried 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
became 1
far 1
more 1
pleasant 1
than 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
was 1
uniform 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
attended 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
dispersed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
i 1
slept 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
observing 1
my 1
friends 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
moon 1
or 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
starlight 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
fuel 1
for 1
the 1
cottage 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
i 1
cleared 1
their 1
path 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
performed 1
those 1
offices 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
done 1
by 1
felix 1
i 1
afterwards 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
labours 1
performed 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
them 1
and 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
i 1
heard 1
them 1
on 1
these 1
occasions 1
utter 1
the 1
words 1
good 1
spirit 1
wonderful 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
then 1
understand 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
these 1
terms 1
my 1
thoughts 1
now 1
became 1
more 1
active 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
and 1
feelings 1
of 1
these 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
i 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
felix 1
appeared 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
agatha 1
so 1
sad 1
i 1
thought 1
foolish 1
wretch 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
happiness 1
to 1
these 1
deserving 1
people 1
when 1
i 1
slept 1
or 1
was 1
absent 1
the 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
venerable 1
blind 1
father 1
the 1
gentle 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
excellent 1
felix 1
flitted 1
before 1
me 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
them 1
as 1
superior 1
beings 1
who 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
arbiters 1
of 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
i 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
imagination 1
a 1
thousand 1
pictures 1
of 1
presenting 1
myself 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
reception 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
disgusted 1
until 1
by 1
my 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
and 1
conciliating 1
words 1
i 1
should 1
first 1
win 1
their 1
favour 1
and 1
afterwards 1
their 1
love 1
these 1
thoughts 1
exhilarated 1
me 1
and 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
apply 1
with 1
fresh 1
ardour 1
to 1
the 1
acquiring 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
language 1
my 1
organs 1
were 1
indeed 1
harsh 1
but 1
supple 1
and 1
although 1
my 1
voice 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
the 1
soft 1
music 1
of 1
their 1
tones 1
yet 1
i 1
pronounced 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
with 1
tolerable 1
ease 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
lapdog 1
yet 1
surely 1
the 1
gentle 1
ass 1
whose 1
intentions 1
were 1
affectionate 1
although 1
his 1
manners 1
were 1
rude 1
deserved 1
better 1
treatment 1
than 1
blows 1
and 1
execration 1
the 1
pleasant 1
showers 1
and 1
genial 1
warmth 1
of 1
spring 1
greatly 1
altered 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
men 1
who 1
before 1
this 1
change 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
hid 1
in 1
caves 1
dispersed 1
themselves 1
and 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
arts 1
of 1
cultivation 1
the 1
birds 1
sang 1
in 1
more 1
cheerful 1
notes 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
began 1
to 1
bud 1
forth 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
happy 1
happy 1
earth 1
fit 1
habitation 1
for 1
gods 1
which 1
so 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
before 1
was 1
bleak 1
damp 1
and 1
unwholesome 1
my 1
spirits 1
were 1
elevated 1
by 1
the 1
enchanting 1
appearance 1
of 1
nature 1
the 1
past 1
was 1
blotted 1
from 1
my 1
memory 1
the 1
present 1
was 1
tranquil 1
and 1
the 1
future 1
gilded 1
by 1
bright 1
rays 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
anticipations 1
of 1
joy 1

i 1
now 1
hasten 1
to 1
the 1
more 1
moving 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
i 1
shall 1
relate 1
events 1
that 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
feelings 1
which 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
spring 1
advanced 1
rapidly 1
the 1
weather 1
became 1
fine 1
and 1
the 1
skies 1
cloudless 1
it 1
surprised 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
before 1
was 1
desert 1
and 1
gloomy 1
should 1
now 1
bloom 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
flowers 1
and 1
verdure 1
my 1
senses 1
were 1
gratified 1
and 1
refreshed 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
scents 1
of 1
delight 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
sights 1
of 1
beauty 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
when 1
my 1
cottagers 1
periodically 1
rested 1
from 1
labourthe 1
old 1
man 1
played 1
on 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
listened 1
to 1
himthat 1
i 1
observed 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
melancholy 1
beyond 1
expression 1
he 1
sighed 1
frequently 1
and 1
once 1
his 1
father 1
paused 1
in 1
his 1
music 1
and 1
i 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
inquired 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
sons 1
sorrow 1
felix 1
replied 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
recommencing 1
his 1
music 1
when 1
someone 1
tapped 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lady 1
on 1
horseback 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
countryman 1
as 1
a 1
guide 1
the 1
lady 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
suit 1
and 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
thick 1
black 1
veil 1
agatha 1
asked 1
a 1
question 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
only 1
replied 1
by 1
pronouncing 1
in 1
a 1
sweet 1
accent 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
felix 1
her 1
voice 1
was 1
musical 1
but 1
unlike 1
that 1
of 1
either 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
word 1
felix 1
came 1
up 1
hastily 1
to 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
him 1
threw 1
up 1
her 1
veil 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
countenance 1
of 1
angelic 1
beauty 1
and 1
expression 1
her 1
hair 1
of 1
a 1
shining 1
raven 1
black 1
and 1
curiously 1
braided 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
dark 1
but 1
gentle 1
although 1
animated 1
her 1
features 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
proportion 1
and 1
her 1
complexion 1
wondrously 1
fair 1
each 1
cheek 1
tinged 1
with 1
a 1
lovely 1
pink 1
felix 1
seemed 1
ravished 1
with 1
delight 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
every 1
trait 1
of 1
sorrow 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
it 1
instantly 1
expressed 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
ecstatic 1
joy 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
capable 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
as 1
his 1
cheek 1
flushed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
thought 1
him 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
the 1
stranger 1
she 1
appeared 1
affected 1
by 1
different 1
feelings 1
wiping 1
a 1
few 1
tears 1
from 1
her 1
lovely 1
eyes 1
she 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
felix 1
who 1
kissed 1
it 1
rapturously 1
and 1
called 1
her 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
his 1
sweet 1
arabian 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
understand 1
him 1
but 1
smiled 1
he 1
assisted 1
her 1
to 1
dismount 1
and 1
dismissing 1
her 1
guide 1
conducted 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
some 1
conversation 1
took 1
place 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
stranger 1
knelt 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
mans 1
feet 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
kissed 1
his 1
hand 1
but 1
he 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
affectionately 1
i 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
stranger 1
uttered 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
she 1
was 1
neither 1
understood 1
by 1
nor 1
herself 1
understood 1
the 1
cottagers 1
they 1
made 1
many 1
signs 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
her 1
presence 1
diffused 1
gladness 1
through 1
the 1
cottage 1
dispelling 1
their 1
sorrow 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
dissipates 1
the 1
morning 1
mists 1
felix 1
seemed 1
peculiarly 1
happy 1
and 1
with 1
smiles 1
of 1
delight 1
welcomed 1
his 1
arabian 1
agatha 1
the 1
evergentle 1
agatha 1
kissed 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
lovely 1
stranger 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
her 1
brother 1
made 1
signs 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sorrowful 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
while 1
they 1
by 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
joy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
presently 1
i 1
found 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
recurrence 1
of 1
some 1
sound 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
repeated 1
after 1
them 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
learn 1
their 1
language 1
and 1
the 1
idea 1
instantly 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
instructions 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
end 1
the 1
stranger 1
learned 1
about 1
twenty 1
words 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
lesson 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
indeed 1
were 1
those 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
understood 1
but 1
i 1
profited 1
by 1
the 1
others 1
as 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
arabian 1
retired 1
early 1
when 1
they 1
separated 1
felix 1
kissed 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
night 1
sweet 1
safie 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
much 1
longer 1
conversing 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
repetition 1
of 1
her 1
name 1
i 1
conjectured 1
that 1
their 1
lovely 1
guest 1
was 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
their 1
conversation 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
bent 1
every 1
faculty 1
towards 1
that 1
purpose 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
utterly 1
impossible 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
felix 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
usual 1
occupations 1
of 1
agatha 1
were 1
finished 1
the 1
arabian 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
guitar 1
played 1
some 1
airs 1
so 1
entrancingly 1
beautiful 1
that 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
drew 1
tears 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
delight 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
she 1
sang 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
flowed 1
in 1
a 1
rich 1
cadence 1
swelling 1
or 1
dying 1
away 1
like 1
a 1
nightingale 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
finished 1
she 1
gave 1
the 1
guitar 1
to 1
agatha 1
who 1
at 1
first 1
declined 1
it 1
she 1
played 1
a 1
simple 1
air 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
accompanied 1
it 1
in 1
sweet 1
accents 1
but 1
unlike 1
the 1
wondrous 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
appeared 1
enraptured 1
and 1
said 1
some 1
words 1
which 1
agatha 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
safie 1
and 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
wish 1
to 1
express 1
that 1
she 1
bestowed 1
on 1
him 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
by 1
her 1
music 1
the 1
days 1
now 1
passed 1
as 1
peaceably 1
as 1
before 1
with 1
the 1
sole 1
alteration 1
that 1
joy 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
of 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
safie 1
was 1
always 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
she 1
and 1
i 1
improved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
language 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
comprehend 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
words 1
uttered 1
by 1
my 1
protectors 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
also 1
the 1
black 1
ground 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
herbage 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
banks 1
interspersed 1
with 1
innumerable 1
flowers 1
sweet 1
to 1
the 1
scent 1
and 1
the 1
eyes 1
stars 1
of 1
pale 1
radiance 1
among 1
the 1
moonlight 1
woods 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
the 1
nights 1
clear 1
and 1
balmy 1
and 1
my 1
nocturnal 1
rambles 1
were 1
an 1
extreme 1
pleasure 1
to 1
me 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
considerably 1
shortened 1
by 1
the 1
late 1
setting 1
and 1
early 1
rising 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
i 1
never 1
ventured 1
abroad 1
during 1
daylight 1
fearful 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
treatment 1
i 1
had 1
formerly 1
endured 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
village 1
which 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
days 1
were 1
spent 1
in 1
close 1
attention 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
more 1
speedily 1
master 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
boast 1
that 1
i 1
improved 1
more 1
rapidly 1
than 1
the 1
arabian 1
who 1
understood 1
very 1
little 1
and 1
conversed 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
whilst 1
i 1
comprehended 1
and 1
could 1
imitate 1
almost 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
was 1
spoken 1
while 1
i 1
improved 1
in 1
speech 1
i 1
also 1
learned 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
letters 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
taught 1
to 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
this 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
a 1
wide 1
field 1
for 1
wonder 1
and 1
delight 1
the 1
book 1
from 1
which 1
felix 1
instructed 1
safie 1
was 1
volneys 1
ruins 1
of 1
empires 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
had 1
not 1
felix 1
in 1
reading 1
it 1
given 1
very 1
minute 1
explanations 1
he 1
had 1
chosen 1
this 1
work 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
the 1
declamatory 1
style 1
was 1
framed 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
eastern 1
authors 1
through 1
this 1
work 1
i 1
obtained 1
a 1
cursory 1
knowledge 1
of 1
history 1
and 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
several 1
empires 1
at 1
present 1
existing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
an 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
manners 1
governments 1
and 1
religions 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
nations 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
slothful 1
asiatics 1
of 1
the 1
stupendous 1
genius 1
and 1
mental 1
activity 1
of 1
the 1
grecians 1
of 1
the 1
wars 1
and 1
wonderful 1
virtue 1
of 1
the 1
early 1

i 1
heard 1
of 1

the 1

wept 1
with 1
safie 1
over 1
the 1
hapless 1
fate 1
of 1
its 1
original 1
inhabitants 1
these 1
wonderful 1
narrations 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
strange 1
feelings 1
was 1
man 1
indeed 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
powerful 1
so 1
virtuous 1
and 1
magnificent 1
yet 1
so 1
vicious 1
and 1
base 1
he 1
appeared 1
at 1
one 1

a 1
mere 1
scion 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
principle 1

at 1
another 1

all 1
that 1
can 1

conceived 1
of 1
noble 1
and 1
godlike 1
to 1
be 1
a 1

honour 1
that 1
can 1
befall 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
to 1
be 1
base 1
and 1
vicious 1
as 1
many 1
on 1

have 1

appeared 1
the 1
lowest 1
degradation 1
a 1
condition 1
more 1
abject 1

that 1
of 1
the 1

mole 1

for 1
a 1
long 1

i 1
could 1
not 1
conceive 1
how 1
one 1
man 1
could 1
go 1
forth 1
to 1
murder 1
his 1
fellow 1
or 1
even 1
why 1
there 1
were 1
laws 1
and 1
governments 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
details 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
bloodshed 1
my 1
wonder 1
ceased 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
away 1
with 1
disgust 1
and 1
loathing 1
every 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
now 1
opened 1
new 1
wonders 1
to 1
me 1
while 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
instructions 1
which 1
felix 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
the 1
arabian 1
the 1
strange 1
system 1
of 1
human 1
society 1
was 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
division 1
of 1
property 1
of 1
immense 1
wealth 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
of 1
rank 1
descent 1
and 1
noble 1
blood 1
the 1
words 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
turn 1
towards 1
myself 1
i 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
possessions 1
most 1
esteemed 1
by 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
unsullied 1
descent 1
united 1
with 1
riches 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
be 1
respected 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
advantages 1
but 1
without 1
either 1
he 1
was 1
considered 1
except 1
in 1
very 1
rare 1
instances 1
as 1
a 1
vagabond 1
and 1
a 1
slave 1
doomed 1
to 1
waste 1
his 1
powers 1
for 1
the 1
profits 1
of 1
the 1
chosen 1
few 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
of 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
creator 1
i 1
was 1
absolutely 1
ignorant 1
but 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
possessed 1
no 1
money 1
no 1
friends 1
no 1
kind 1
of 1
property 1
i 1
was 1
besides 1
endued 1
with 1
a 1
figure 1
hideously 1
deformed 1
and 1
loathsome 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
more 1
agile 1
than 1
they 1
and 1
could 1
subsist 1
upon 1
coarser 1
diet 1
i 1
bore 1
the 1
extremes 1
of 1
heat 1
and 1
cold 1
with 1
less 1
injury 1
to 1
my 1
frame 1
my 1
stature 1
far 1
exceeded 1
theirs 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
around 1
i 1
saw 1
and 1
heard 1
of 1
none 1
like 1
me 1
was 1
i 1
then 1
a 1
monster 1
a 1
blot 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
men 1
fled 1
and 1
whom 1
all 1
men 1
disowned 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
agony 1
that 1
these 1
reflections 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
dispel 1
them 1
but 1
sorrow 1
only 1
increased 1
with 1
knowledge 1
oh 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
forever 1
remained 1
in 1
my 1
native 1
wood 1
nor 1
known 1
nor 1
felt 1
beyond 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
heat 1
of 1
what 1
a 1
strange 1
nature 1
is 1
knowledge 1
it 1
clings 1
to 1
the 1
mind 1
when 1
it 1
has 1
once 1
seized 1
on 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
lichen 1
on 1
the 1
rock 1
i 1
wished 1
sometimes 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
all 1
thought 1
and 1
feeling 1
but 1
i 1
learned 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
means 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
deatha 1
state 1
which 1
i 1
feared 1
yet 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
i 1
admired 1
virtue 1
and 1
good 1
feelings 1
and 1
loved 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
amiable 1
qualities 1
of 1
my 1
cottagers 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
intercourse 1
with 1
them 1
except 1
through 1
means 1
which 1
i 1
obtained 1
by 1
stealth 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
unseen 1
and 1
unknown 1
and 1
which 1
rather 1
increased 1
than 1
satisfied 1
the 1
desire 1
i 1
had 1
of 1
becoming 1
one 1
among 1
my 1
fellows 1
the 1
gentle 1
words 1
of 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
animated 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
charming 1
arabian 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
mild 1
exhortations 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
loved 1
felix 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
miserable 1
unhappy 1
wretch 1
other 1
lessons 1
were 1
impressed 1
upon 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
deeply 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
difference 1
of 1
sexes 1
and 1
the 1
birth 1
and 1
growth 1
of 1
children 1
how 1
the 1
father 1
doted 1
on 1
the 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
infant 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
sallies 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
child 1
how 1
all 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
cares 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
were 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
precious 1
charge 1
how 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
youth 1
expanded 1
and 1
gained 1
knowledge 1
of 1
brother 1
sister 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
various 1
relationships 1
which 1
bind 1
one 1
human 1
being 1
to 1
another 1
in 1
mutual 1
bonds 1
but 1
where 1
were 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
relations 1
no 1
father 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
infant 1
days 1
no 1
mother 1
had 1
blessed 1
me 1
with 1
smiles 1
and 1
caresses 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
my 1
past 1
life 1
was 1
now 1
a 1
blot 1
a 1
blind 1
vacancy 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
distinguished 1
nothing 1
from 1
my 1
earliest 1
remembrance 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
as 1
i 1
then 1
was 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportion 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
seen 1
a 1
being 1
resembling 1
me 1
or 1
who 1
claimed 1
any 1
intercourse 1
with 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
the 1
question 1
again 1
recurred 1
to 1
be 1
answered 1
only 1
with 1
groans 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
explain 1
to 1
what 1
these 1
feelings 1
tended 1
but 1
allow 1
me 1
now 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
whose 1
story 1
excited 1
in 1
me 1
such 1
various 1
feelings 1
of 1
indignation 1
delight 1
and 1
wonder 1
but 1
which 1
all 1
terminated 1
in 1
additional 1
love 1
and 1
reverence 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
for 1
so 1
i 1
loved 1
in 1
an 1
innocent 1
halfpainful 1
selfdeceit 1
to 1
call 1
them 1
chapter 1
14 1
some 1
time 1
elapsed 1
before 1
i 1
learned 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
fail 1
to 1
impress 1
itself 1
deeply 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
unfolding 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
circumstances 1
each 1
interesting 1
and 1
wonderful 1
to 1
one 1
so 1
utterly 1
inexperienced 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
de 1
lacey 1
he 1
was 1
descended 1
from 1
a 1
good 1
family 1
in 1
france 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
in 1
affluence 1
respected 1
by 1
his 1
superiors 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
his 1
equals 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
bred 1
in 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
and 1
agatha 1
had 1
ranked 1
with 1
ladies 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
distinction 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
arrival 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
large 1
and 1
luxurious 1
city 1
called 1
paris 1
surrounded 1
by 1
friends 1
and 1
possessed 1
of 1
every 1
enjoyment 1
which 1
virtue 1
refinement 1
of 1
intellect 1
or 1
taste 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
could 1
afford 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
safie 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
their 1
ruin 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
turkish 1
merchant 1
and 1
had 1
inhabited 1
paris 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
when 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
learn 1
he 1
became 1
obnoxious 1
to 1
the 1
government 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
and 1
cast 1
into 1
prison 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
that 1
safie 1
arrived 1
from 1
constantinople 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
tried 1
and 1
condemned 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
injustice 1
of 1
his 1
sentence 1
was 1
very 1
flagrant 1
all 1
paris 1
was 1
indignant 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
judged 1
that 1
his 1
religion 1
and 1
wealth 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
crime 1
alleged 1
against 1
him 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
condemnation 1
felix 1
had 1
accidentally 1
been 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
trial 1
his 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
were 1
uncontrollable 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
decision 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
he 1
made 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
to 1
deliver 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
around 1
for 1
the 1
means 1
after 1
many 1
fruitless 1
attempts 1
to 1
gain 1
admittance 1
to 1
the 1
prison 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
strongly 1
grated 1
window 1
in 1
an 1
unguarded 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
which 1
lighted 1
the 1
dungeon 1
of 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
muhammadan 1
who 1
loaded 1
with 1
chains 1
waited 1
in 1
despair 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
the 1
barbarous 1
sentence 1
felix 1
visited 1
the 1
grate 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
made 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
prisoner 1
his 1
intentions 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
the 1
turk 1
amazed 1
and 1
delighted 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
kindle 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
by 1
promises 1
of 1
reward 1
and 1
wealth 1
felix 1
rejected 1
his 1
offers 1
with 1
contempt 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
lovely 1
safie 1
who 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
visit 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
who 1
by 1
her 1
gestures 1
expressed 1
her 1
lively 1
gratitude 1
the 1
youth 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
owning 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
captive 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
which 1
would 1
fully 1
reward 1
his 1
toil 1
and 1
hazard 1
the 1
turk 1
quickly 1
perceived 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
made 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
secure 1
him 1
more 1
entirely 1
in 1
his 1
interests 1
by 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
marriage 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
conveyed 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
felix 1
was 1
too 1
delicate 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
offer 1
yet 1
he 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
the 1
probability 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
his 1
happiness 1
during 1
the 1
ensuing 1
days 1
while 1
the 1
preparations 1
were 1
going 1
forward 1
for 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
the 1
merchant 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
warmed 1
by 1
several 1
letters 1
that 1
he 1
received 1
from 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
who 1
found 1
means 1
to 1
express 1
her 1
thoughts 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
a 1
servant 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
who 1
understood 1
french 1
she 1
thanked 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
ardent 1
terms 1
for 1
his 1
intended 1
services 1
towards 1
her 1
parent 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
gently 1
deplored 1
her 1
own 1
fate 1
i 1
have 1
copies 1
of 1
these 1
letters 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
means 1
during 1
my 1
residence 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
implements 1
of 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
letters 1
were 1
often 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
felix 1
or 1
agatha 1
before 1
i 1
depart 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
they 1
will 1
prove 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1
but 1
at 1
present 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
already 1
far 1
declined 1
i 1
shall 1
only 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
repeat 1
the 1
substance 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
safie 1
related 1
that 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
christian 1
arab 1
seized 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
slave 1
by 1
the 1
turks 1
recommended 1
by 1
her 1
beauty 1
she 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
safie 1
who 1
married 1
her 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
spoke 1
in 1
high 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
terms 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
who 1
born 1
in 1
freedom 1
spurned 1
the 1
bondage 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
now 1
reduced 1
she 1
instructed 1
her 1
daughter 1
in 1
the 1
tenets 1
of 1
her 1
religion 1
and 1
taught 1
her 1
to 1
aspire 1
to 1
higher 1
powers 1
of 1
intellect 1
and 1
an 1
independence 1
of 1
spirit 1
forbidden 1
to 1
the 1
female 1
followers 1
of 1
muhammad 1
this 1
lady 1
died 1
but 1
her 1
lessons 1
were 1
indelibly 1
impressed 1
on 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
safie 1
who 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
again 1
returning 1
to 1
asia 1
and 1
being 1
immured 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
harem 1
allowed 1
only 1
to 1
occupy 1
herself 1
with 1
infantile 1
amusements 1
illsuited 1
to 1
the 1
temper 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1
now 1
accustomed 1
to 1
grand 1
