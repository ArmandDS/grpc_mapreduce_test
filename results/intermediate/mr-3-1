what 1
he 1
desired 1
but 1
went 1
away 1
quite 1
angry 1
and 1
grumbling 1
now 1
this 1
jam 1
shall 1
be 1
blessed 1
by 1
god 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
health 1
and 1
strength 1
so 1
he 1
brought 1
the 1
bread 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cupboard 1
cut 1
himself 1
a 1
piece 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
loaf 1
and 1
spread 1
the 1
jam 1
over 1
it 1
this 1
wont 1
taste 1
bitter 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
just 1
finish 1
the 1
jacket 1
before 1
i 1
take 1
a 1
bite 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
bread 1
near 1
him 1
sewed 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
joy 1
made 1
bigger 1
and 1
bigger 1
stitches 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
jam 1
rose 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
flies 1
were 1
sitting 1
in 1
great 1
numbers 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
attracted 1
and 1
descended 1
on 1
it 1
in 1
hosts 1
hi 1
who 1
invited 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
unbidden 1
guests 1
away 1
the 1
flies 1
however 1
who 1
understood 1
no 1
german 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
turned 1
away 1
but 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
everincreasing 1
companies 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
at 1
last 1
lost 1
all 1
patience 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cloth 1
from 1
the 1
hole 1
under 1
his 1
worktable 1
and 1
saying 1
wait 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
struck 1
it 1
mercilessly 1
on 1
them 1
when 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
counted 1
there 1
lay 1
before 1
him 1
no 1
fewer 1
than 1
seven 1
dead 1
and 1
with 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
are 1
you 1
a 1
fellow 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
admiring 1
his 1
own 1
bravery 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
shall 1
know 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
hastened 1
to 1
cut 1
himself 1
a 1
girdle 1
stitched 1
it 1
and 1
embroidered 1
on 1
it 1
in 1
large 1
letters 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
what 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
continued 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
shall 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
wagged 1
with 1
joy 1
like 1
a 1
lambs 1
tail 1
the 1
tailor 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
girdle 1
and 1
resolved 1
to 1
go 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
because 1
he 1
thought 1
his 1
workshop 1
was 1
too 1
small 1
for 1
his 1
valour 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
he 1
sought 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
with 1
him 1
however 1
he 1
found 1
nothing 1
but 1
an 1
old 1
cheese 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
observed 1
a 1
bird 1
which 1
had 1
caught 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
with 1
the 1
cheese 1
now 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
road 1
boldly 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
nimble 1
he 1
felt 1
no 1
fatigue 1
the 1
road 1
led 1
him 1
up 1
a 1
mountain 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
highest 1
point 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
powerful 1
giant 1
looking 1
peacefully 1
about 1
him 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
bravely 1
up 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
day 1
comrade 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
sitting 1
there 1
overlooking 1
the 1
widespread 1
world 1
i 1
am 1
just 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
thither 1
and 1
want 1
to 1
try 1
my 1
luck 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
inclination 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
the 1
giant 1
looked 1
contemptuously 1
at 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
ragamuffin 1
you 1
miserable 1
creature 1
oh 1
indeed 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
unbuttoned 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
showed 1
the 1
giant 1
the 1
girdle 1
there 1
may 1
you 1
read 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
giant 1
read 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
men 1
whom 1
the 1
tailor 1
had 1
killed 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
little 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
tiny 1
fellow 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
try 1
him 1
first 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
stone 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
squeezed 1
it 1
together 1
so 1
that 1
water 1
dropped 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
do 1
that 1
likewise 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
strength 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
that 1
is 1
childs 1
play 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
soft 1
cheese 1
and 1
pressed 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
liquid 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
faith 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
better 1
wasnt 1
it 1
the 1
giant 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
believe 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
then 1
the 1
giant 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
the 1
eye 1
could 1
scarcely 1
follow 1
it 1
now 1
little 1
mite 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
do 1
that 1
likewise 1
well 1
thrown 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
earth 1
again 1
i 1
will 1
throw 1
you 1
one 1
which 1
shall 1
never 1
come 1
back 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
bird 1
delighted 1
with 1
its 1
liberty 1
rose 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
how 1
does 1
that 1
shot 1
please 1
you 1
comrade 1
asked 1
the 1
tailor 1
you 1
can 1
certainly 1
throw 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
will 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
able 1
to 1
carry 1
anything 1
properly 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
to 1
a 1
mighty 1
oak 1
tree 1
which 1
lay 1
there 1
felled 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
strong 1
enough 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
carry 1
the 1
tree 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
readily 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
take 1
you 1
the 1
trunk 1
on 1
your 1
shoulders 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
raise 1
up 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
twigs 1
after 1
all 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
heaviest 1
the 1
giant 1
took 1
the 1
trunk 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
but 1
the 1
tailor 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
a 1
branch 1
and 1
the 1
giant 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
away 1
the 1
whole 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
he 1
behind 1
was 1
quite 1
merry 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
whistled 1
the 1
song 1
three 1
tailors 1
rode 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
gate 1
as 1
if 1
carrying 1
the 1
tree 1
were 1
childs 1
play 1
the 1
giant 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
dragged 1
the 1
heavy 1
burden 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
further 1
and 1
cried 1
hark 1
you 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
tree 1
fall 1
the 1
tailor 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
down 1
seized 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
both 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
carrying 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
giant 1
you 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
fellow 1
and 1
yet 1
cannot 1
even 1
carry 1
the 1
tree 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
together 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
cherrytree 1
the 1
giant 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
the 1
ripest 1
fruit 1
was 1
hanging 1
bent 1
it 1
down 1
gave 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
tailors 1
hand 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
eat 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
weak 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
giant 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
it 1
sprang 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
tailor 1
was 1
tossed 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
down 1
again 1
without 1
injury 1
the 1
giant 1
said 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
weak 1
twig 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
lack 1
of 1
strength 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
struck 1
down 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
i 1
leapt 1
over 1
the 1
tree 1
because 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
are 1
shooting 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
jump 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
the 1
giant 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
over 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
remained 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
also 1
the 1
tailor 1
kept 1
the 1
upper 1
hand 1
the 1
giant 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
valiant 1
fellow 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
our 1
cavern 1
and 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
us 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
followed 1
him 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cave 1
other 1
giants 1
were 1
sitting 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
a 1
roasted 1
sheep 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
was 1
eating 1
it 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
is 1
much 1
more 1
spacious 1
here 1
than 1
in 1
my 1
workshop 1
the 1
giant 1
showed 1
him 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
sleep 1
the 1
bed 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
big 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
lie 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
crept 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
giant 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
a 1
sound 1
sleep 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
took 1
a 1
great 1
iron 1
bar 1
cut 1
through 1
the 1
bed 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
and 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
off 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
for 1
good 1
with 1
the 1
earliest 1
dawn 1
the 1
giants 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
when 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
quite 1
merrily 1
and 1
boldly 1
the 1
giants 1
were 1
terrified 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
strike 1
them 1
all 1
dead 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
onwards 1
always 1
following 1
his 1
own 1
pointed 1
nose 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
courtyard 1
of 1
a 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
weary 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
whilst 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
the 1
people 1
came 1
and 1
inspected 1
him 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
and 1
read 1
on 1
his 1
girdle 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
ah 1
said 1
they 1
what 1
does 1
the 1
great 1
warrior 1
want 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
peace 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
mighty 1
lord 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
announced 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
as 1
their 1
opinion 1
that 1
if 1
war 1
should 1
break 1
out 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
weighty 1
and 1
useful 1
man 1
who 1
ought 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
depart 1
the 1
counsel 1
pleased 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
courtiers 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
to 1
offer 1
him 1
military 1
service 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
the 1
ambassador 1
remained 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
sleeper 1
waited 1
until 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
limbs 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
then 1
conveyed 1
to 1
him 1
this 1
proposal 1
for 1
this 1
very 1
reason 1
have 1
i 1
come 1
here 1
the 1
tailor 1
replied 1
i 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
kings 1
service 1
he 1
was 1
therefore 1
honourably 1
received 1
and 1
a 1
special 1
dwelling 1
was 1
assigned 1
him 1
the 1
soldiers 1
however 1
were 1
set 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
a 1
thousand 1
miles 1
away 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
they 1
said 1
among 1
themselves 1
if 1
we 1
quarrel 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
strikes 1
about 1
him 1
seven 1
of 1
us 1
will 1
fall 1
at 1
every 1
blow 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
stand 1
against 1
him 1
they 1
came 1
therefore 1
to 1
a 1
decision 1
betook 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
body 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
their 1
dismissal 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
prepared 1
said 1
they 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
kills 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
sorry 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
one 1
he 1
should 1
lose 1
all 1
his 1
faithful 1
servants 1
wished 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
would 1
willingly 1
have 1
been 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
again 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
his 1
dismissal 1
for 1
he 1
dreaded 1
lest 1
he 1
should 1
strike 1
him 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
people 1
dead 1
and 1
place 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
royal 1
throne 1
he 1
thought 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
found 1
good 1
counsel 1
he 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
informed 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
warrior 1
he 1
had 1
one 1
request 1
to 1
make 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
lived 1
two 1
giants 1
who 1
caused 1
great 1
mischief 1
with 1
their 1
robbing 1
murdering 1
ravaging 1
and 1
burning 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
approach 1
them 1
without 1
putting 1
himself 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
death 1
if 1
the 1
tailor 1
conquered 1
and 1
killed 1
these 1
two 1
giants 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
his 1
only 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
and 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
kingdom 1
as 1
a 1
dowry 1
likewise 1
one 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
should 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
that 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
me 1
thought 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
one 1
is 1
not 1
offered 1
a 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
ones 1
life 1
oh 1
yes 1
he 1
replied 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
subdue 1
the 1
giants 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
require 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
who 1
can 1
hit 1
seven 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
has 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
two 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
the 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
followed 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
followers 1
just 1
stay 1
waiting 1
here 1
i 1
alone 1
will 1
soon 1
finish 1
off 1
the 1
giants 1
then 1
he 1
bounded 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
perceived 1
both 1
giants 1
they 1
lay 1
sleeping 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
snored 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
branches 1
waved 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
not 1
idle 1
gathered 1
two 1
pocketsful 1
of 1
stones 1
and 1
with 1
these 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
halfway 1
up 1
he 1
slipped 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
branch 1
until 1
he 1
sat 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
sleepers 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
one 1
stone 1
after 1
another 1
fall 1
on 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
giants 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
giant 1
felt 1
nothing 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
awoke 1
pushed 1
his 1
comrade 1
and 1
said 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
knocking 1
me 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
dreaming 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
knocking 1
you 1
they 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
tailor 1
threw 1
a 1
stone 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
cried 1
the 1
other 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
pelting 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
pelting 1
you 1
answered 1
the 1
first 1
growling 1
they 1
disputed 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
weary 1
they 1
let 1
the 1
matter 1
rest 1
and 1
their 1
eyes 1
closed 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
began 1
his 1
game 1
again 1
picked 1
out 1
the 1
biggest 1
stone 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
on 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
giant 1
that 1
is 1
too 1
bad 1
cried 1
he 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
madman 1
and 1
pushed 1
his 1
companion 1
against 1
the 1
tree 1
until 1
it 1
shook 1
the 1
other 1
paid 1
him 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
coin 1
and 1
they 1
got 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
rage 1
that 1
they 1
tore 1
up 1
trees 1
and 1
belaboured 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
both 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
leapt 1
down 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
lucky 1
thing 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
tear 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
sitting 1
or 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
sprint 1
on 1
to 1
another 1
like 1
a 1
squirrel 1
but 1
we 1
tailors 1
are 1
nimble 1
he 1
drew 1
out 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
gave 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
thrusts 1
in 1
the 1
breast 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
horsemen 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
work 1
is 1
done 1
i 1
have 1
finished 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
off 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
work 1
they 1
tore 1
up 1
trees 1
in 1
their 1
sore 1
need 1
and 1
defended 1
themselves 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
myself 1
comes 1
who 1
can 1
kill 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
but 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
wounded 1
asked 1
the 1
horsemen 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
concern 1
yourself 1
about 1
that 1
answered 1
the 1
tailor 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
bent 1
one 1
hair 1
of 1
mine 1
the 1
horsemen 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
him 1
and 1
rode 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
giants 1
swimming 1
in 1
their 1
blood 1
and 1
all 1
round 1
about 1
lay 1
the 1
tornup 1
trees 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
demanded 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
he 1
however 1
repented 1
of 1
his 1
promise 1
and 1
again 1
bethought 1
himself 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
hero 1
before 1
you 1
receive 1
my 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
half 1
of 1
my 1
kingdom 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
must 1
perform 1
one 1
more 1
heroic 1
deed 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
roams 1
a 1
unicorn 1
which 1
does 1
great 1
harm 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
catch 1
it 1
first 1
i 1
fear 1
one 1
unicorn 1
still 1
less 1
than 1
two 1
giants 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
is 1
my 1
kind 1
of 1
affair 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
an 1
axe 1
with 1
him 1
went 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
again 1
bade 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
sent 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
wait 1
outside 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
unicorn 1
soon 1
came 1
towards 1
him 1
and 1
rushed 1
directly 1
on 1
the 1
tailor 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
gore 1
him 1
with 1
its 1
horn 1
without 1
more 1
ado 1
softly 1
softly 1
it 1
cant 1
be 1
done 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
waited 1
until 1
the 1
animal 1
was 1
quite 1
close 1
and 1
then 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
behind 1
the 1
tree 1
the 1
unicorn 1
ran 1
against 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
strength 1
and 1
stuck 1
its 1
horn 1
so 1
fast 1
in 1
the 1
trunk 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
thus 1
it 1
was 1
caught 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
bird 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
came 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
rope 1
round 1
its 1
neck 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
his 1
axe 1
he 1
hewed 1
the 1
horn 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
ready 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
beast 1
away 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
king 1
still 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
third 1
demand 1
before 1
the 1
wedding 1
the 1
tailor 1
was 1
to 1
catch 1
him 1
a 1
wild 1
boar 1
that 1
made 1
great 1
havoc 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
should 1
give 1
him 1
their 1
help 1
willingly 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
that 1
is 1
childs 1
play 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
with 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
pleased 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
boar 1
had 1
several 1
times 1
received 1
them 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
inclination 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
boar 1
perceived 1
the 1
tailor 1
it 1
ran 1
on 1
him 1
with 1
foaming 1
mouth 1
and 1
whetted 1
tusks 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
throw 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
the 1
hero 1
fled 1
and 1
sprang 1
into 1
a 1
chapel 1
which 1
was 1
near 1
and 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
in 1
one 1
bound 1
out 1
again 1
the 1
boar 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
tailor 1
ran 1
round 1
outside 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
raging 1
beast 1
which 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
heavy 1
and 1
awkward 1
to 1
leap 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
was 1
caught 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
called 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
thither 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
see 1
the 1
prisoner 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
eyes 1
the 1
hero 1
however 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
whether 1
he 1
liked 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
promise 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
kingdom 1
had 1
he 1
known 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
warlike 1
hero 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
before 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
still 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
did 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
with 1
great 1
magnificence 1
and 1
small 1
joy 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
tailor 1
a 1
king 1
was 1
made 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
the 1
young 1
queen 1
heard 1
her 1
husband 1
say 1
in 1
his 1
dreams 1
at 1
night 1
boy 1
make 1
me 1
the 1
doublet 1
and 1
patch 1
the 1
pantaloons 1
or 1
else 1
i 1
will 1
rap 1
the 1
yardmeasure 1
over 1
your 1
ears 1
then 1
she 1
discovered 1
in 1
what 1
state 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
had 1
been 1
born 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
complained 1
of 1
her 1
wrongs 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
who 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
but 1
a 1
tailor 1
the 1
king 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
leave 1
your 1
bedroom 1
door 1
open 1
this 1
night 1
and 1
my 1
servants 1
shall 1
stand 1
outside 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
shall 1
go 1
in 1
bind 1
him 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
ship 1
which 1
shall 1
carry 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
armourbearer 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
was 1
friendly 1
with 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
and 1
informed 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
plot 1
ill 1
put 1
a 1
screw 1
into 1
that 1
business 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
at 1
the 1
usual 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
only 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
asleep 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
voice 1
boy 1
make 1
me 1
the 1
doublet 1
and 1
patch 1
me 1
the 1
pantaloons 1
or 1
i 1
will 1
rap 1
the 1
yardmeasure 1
over 1
your 1
ears 1
i 1
smote 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
i 1
killed 1
two 1
giants 1
i 1
brought 1
away 1
one 1
unicorn 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
wild 1
boar 1
and 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
fear 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
standing 1
outside 1
the 1
room 1
when 1
these 1
men 1
heard 1
the 1
tailor 1
speaking 1
thus 1
they 1
were 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
dread 1
and 1
ran 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
wild 1
huntsman 1
were 1
behind 1
them 1
and 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
venture 1
anything 1
further 1
against 1
him 1
so 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
hard 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
forest 1
dwelt 1
a 1
poor 1
woodcutter 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
children 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
called 1
hansel 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
gretel 1
he 1
had 1
little 1
to 1
bite 1
and 1
to 1
break 1
and 1
once 1
when 1
great 1
dearth 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
land 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
procure 1
even 1
daily 1
bread 1
now 1
when 1
he 1
thought 1
over 1
this 1
by 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
tossed 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
anxiety 1
he 1
groaned 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1

when 1
the 1
old 1
folks 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
little 1
coat 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
below 1
and 1
crept 1
outside 1
the 1
moon 1
shone 1
brightly 1
and 1
the 1
white 1
pebbles 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
glittered 1
like 1
real 1
silver 1
pennies 1
hansel 1
stooped 1
and 1
stuffed 1
the 1
little 1
pocket 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
with 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
get 1

little 1
sister 1
and 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
god 1
will 1
not 1
forsake 1
us 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
when 1
day 1
dawned 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
risen 1
the 1
woman 1
came 1
and 1
awoke 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
saying 1

gave 1
each 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
said 1

is 1
something 1
for 1
your 1
dinner 1
but 1

up 1
before 1

for 1
you 1
will 1
get 1

gretel 1
took 1
the 1
bread 1
under 1
her 1
apron 1
as 1
hansel 1
had 1
the 1
pebbles 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
together 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
hansel 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
peeped 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
did 1
so 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
his 1
father 1
said 1
hansel 1

at 1
there 1
and 1
staying 1
behind 1

how 1
to 1

said 1
hansel 1
i 1
am 1
looking 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
white 1
cat 1
which 1
is 1
sitting 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1

the 1
wife 1
said 1
fool 1
that 1

little 1
cat 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
morning 1
sun 1
which 1
is 1
shining 1
on 1
the 1
chimneys 1
hansel 1
however 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
cat 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
constantly 1
throwing 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
pebblestones 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
now 1
children 1
pile 1
up 1
some 1
wood 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
cold 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
gathered 1
brushwood 1
together 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
a 1
little 1
hill 1
the 1
brushwood 1
was 1
lighted 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
flames 1
were 1
burning 1
very 1
high 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
now 1
children 1
lay 1
yourselves 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
rest 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
cut 1
some 1
wood 1
when 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
away 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
when 1
noon 1
came 1
each 1
ate 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
strokes 1
of 1
the 1
woodaxe 1
they 1
believed 1
that 1
their 1
father 1
was 1
near 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
axe 1
however 1
but 1
a 1
branch 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
fastened 1
to 1
a 1
withered 1
tree 1
which 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
blowing 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
such 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
their 1
eyes 1
closed 1
with 1
fatigue 1
and 1
they 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
dark 1
night 1
gretel 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
said 1
how 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
now 1
but 1
hansel 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
just 1
wait 1
a 1
little 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
has 1
risen 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
full 1
moon 1
had 1
risen 1
hansel 1
took 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
pebbles 1
which 1
shone 1
like 1
newlycoined 1
silver 1
pieces 1
and 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
long 1
and 1
by 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
their 1
fathers 1
house 1
they 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
woman 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
she 1
said 1
you 1
naughty 1
children 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
slept 1
so 1
long 1
in 1
the 1
forestwe 1
thought 1
you 1
were 1
never 1
coming 1
back 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
father 1
however 1
rejoiced 1
for 1
it 1
had 1
cut 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
leave 1
them 1
behind 1
alone 1
not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
great 1
dearth 1
throughout 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
heard 1
their 1
mother 1
saying 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
their 1
father 1
everything 1
is 1
eaten 1
again 1
we 1
have 1
one 1
half 1
loaf 1
left 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
end 1
the 1
children 1
must 1
go 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
them 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
out 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
other 1
means 1
of 1
saving 1
ourselves 1
the 1
mans 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
share 1
the 1
last 1
mouthful 1
with 1
your 1
children 1
the 1
woman 1
however 1
would 1
listen 1
to 1
nothing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
but 1
scolded 1
and 1
reproached 1
him 1
he 1
who 1
says 1
a 1
must 1
say 1
b 1
likewise 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
yielded 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
also 1
the 1
children 1
however 1
were 1
still 1
awake 1
and 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
conversation 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
folks 1
were 1
asleep 1
hansel 1
again 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
pick 1
up 1
pebbles 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hansel 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
out 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
comforted 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
and 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
cry 1
gretel 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
quietly 1
the 1
good 1
god 1
will 1
help 1
us 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
came 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
children 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
their 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
smaller 1
than 1
the 1
time 1
before 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
hansel 1
crumbled 1
his 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
often 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
morsel 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
hansel 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
stop 1
and 1
look 1
round 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
go 1
on 1
i 1
am 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
pigeon 1
which 1
is 1
sitting 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
answered 1
hansel 1
fool 1
said 1
the 1
woman 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
little 1
pigeon 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
morning 1
sun 1
that 1
is 1
shining 1
on 1
the 1
chimney 1
hansel 1
however 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
threw 1
all 1
the 1
crumbs 1
on 1
the 1
path 1
the 1
woman 1
led 1
the 1
children 1
still 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
in 1
their 1
lives 1
been 1
before 1
then 1
a 1
great 1
fire 1
was 1
again 1
made 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
just 1
sit 1
there 1
you 1
children 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
you 1
may 1
sleep 1
a 1
little 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
cut 1
wood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
done 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
away 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
noon 1
gretel 1
shared 1
her 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
with 1
hansel 1
who 1
had 1
scattered 1
his 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
then 1
they 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
evening 1
passed 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
children 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
awake 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
night 1
and 1
hansel 1
comforted 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
and 1
said 1
just 1
wait 1
gretel 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
rises 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
the 1
crumbs 1
of 1
bread 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
strewn 1
about 1
they 1
will 1
show 1
us 1
our 1
way 1
home 1
again 1
when 1
the 1
moon 1
came 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
but 1
they 1
found 1
no 1
crumbs 1
for 1
the 1
many 1
thousands 1
of 1
birds 1
which 1
fly 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
fields 1
had 1
picked 1
them 1
all 1
up 1
hansel 1
said 1
to 1
gretel 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
they 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
too 1
from 1
morning 1
till 1
evening 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
were 1
very 1
hungry 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
berries 1
which 1
grew 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
weary 1
that 1
their 1
legs 1
would 1
carry 1
them 1
no 1
longer 1
they 1
lay 1
down 1
beneath 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
three 1
mornings 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
their 1
fathers 1
house 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
again 1
but 1
they 1
always 1
came 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
if 1
help 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
soon 1
they 1
must 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
and 1
weariness 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
midday 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
snowwhite 1
bird 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
bough 1
which 1
sang 1
so 1
delightfully 1
that 1
they 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
its 1
song 1
was 1
over 1
it 1
spread 1
its 1
wings 1
and 1
flew 1
away 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
followed 1
it 1
until 1
they 1
reached 1
a 1
little 1
house 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
alighted 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
approached 1
the 1
little 1
house 1
they 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
built 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
covered 1
with 1
cakes 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
of 1
clear 1
sugar 1
we 1
will 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
that 1
said 1
hansel 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
meal 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
you 1
gretel 1
can 1
eat 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
it 1
will 1
taste 1
sweet 1
hansel 1
reached 1
up 1
above 1
and 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
to 1
try 1
how 1
it 1
tasted 1
and 1
gretel 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
nibbled 1
at 1
the 1
panes 1
then 1
a 1
soft 1
voice 1
cried 1
from 1
the 1
parlour 1
nibble 1
nibble 1
gnaw 1
who 1
is 1
nibbling 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
house 1
the 1
children 1
answered 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
heavenborn 1
wind 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
eating 1
without 1
disturbing 1
themselves 1
hansel 1
who 1
liked 1
the 1
taste 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
tore 1
down 1
a 1
great 1
piece 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
gretel 1
pushed 1
out 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
one 1
round 1
windowpane 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
herself 1
with 1
it 1
suddenly 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
as 1
old 1
as 1
the 1
hills 1
who 1
supported 1
herself 1
on 1
crutches 1
came 1
creeping 1
out 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
were 1
so 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
that 1
they 1
let 1
fall 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
however 1
nodded 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
oh 1
you 1
dear 1
children 1
who 1
has 1
brought 1
you 1
here 1
do 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
stay 1
with 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
shall 1
happen 1
to 1
you 1
she 1
took 1
them 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
led 1
them 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
house 1
then 1
good 1
food 1
was 1
set 1
before 1
them 1
milk 1
and 1
pancakes 1
with 1
sugar 1
apples 1
and 1
nuts 1
afterwards 1
two 1
pretty 1
little 1
beds 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
clean 1
white 1
linen 1
and 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
lay 1
down 1
in 1
them 1
and 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
heaven 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
only 1
pretended 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
a 1
wicked 1
witch 1
who 1
lay 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
children 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
built 1
the 1
little 1
house 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
entice 1
them 1
there 1
when 1
a 1
child 1
fell 1
into 1
her 1
power 1
she 1
killed 1
it 1
cooked 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
feast 1
day 1
with 1
her 1
witches 1
have 1
red 1
eyes 1
and 1
cannot 1
see 1
far 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
keen 1
scent 1
like 1
the 1
beasts 1
and 1
are 1
aware 1
when 1
human 1
beings 1
draw 1
near 1
when 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
neighbourhood 1
she 1
laughed 1
with 1
malice 1
and 1
said 1
mockingly 1
i 1
have 1
them 1
they 1
shall 1
not 1
escape 1
me 1
again 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
awake 1
she 1
was 1
already 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
sleeping 1
and 1
looking 1
so 1
pretty 1
with 1
their 1
plump 1
and 1
rosy 1
cheeks 1
she 1
muttered 1
to 1
herself 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
dainty 1
mouthful 1
then 1
she 1
seized 1
hansel 1
with 1
her 1
shrivelled 1
hand 1
carried 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
locked 1
him 1
in 1
behind 1
a 1
grated 1
door 1
scream 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
help 1
him 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
gretel 1
shook 1
her 1
till 1
she 1
awoke 1
and 1
cried 1
get 1
up 1
lazy 1
thing 1
fetch 1
some 1
water 1
and 1
cook 1
something 1
good 1
for 1
your 1
brother 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
outside 1
and 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
fat 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
fat 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
him 1
gretel 1
began 1
to 1
weep 1
bitterly 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
the 1
wicked 1
witch 1
commanded 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
best 1
food 1
was 1
cooked 1
for 1
poor 1
hansel 1
but 1
gretel 1
got 1
nothing 1
but 1
crabshells 1
every 1
morning 1
the 1
woman 1
crept 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
cried 1
hansel 1
stretch 1
out 1
your 1
finger 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
feel 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
fat 1
hansel 1
however 1
stretched 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
bone 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
dim 1
eyes 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
hansels 1
finger 1
and 1
was 1
astonished 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
fattening 1
him 1
when 1
four 1
weeks 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
and 1
hansel 1
still 1
remained 1
thin 1
she 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
impatience 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
now 1
then 1
gretel 1
she 1
cried 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
stir 1
yourself 1
and 1
bring 1
some 1
water 1
let 1
hansel 1
be 1
fat 1
or 1
lean 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
will 1
kill 1
him 1
and 1
cook 1
him 1
ah 1
how 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
sister 1
did 1
lament 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
how 1
her 1
tears 1
did 1
flow 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
dear 1
god 1
do 1
help 1
us 1
she 1
cried 1
if 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
had 1
but 1
devoured 1
us 1
we 1
should 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
have 1
died 1
together 1
just 1
keep 1
your 1
noise 1
to 1
yourself 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
it 1
wont 1
help 1
you 1
at 1
all 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
gretel 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
hang 1
up 1
the 1
cauldron 1
with 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
light 1
the 1
fire 1
we 1
will 1
bake 1
first 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
heated 1
the 1
oven 1
and 1
kneaded 1
the 1
dough 1
she 1
pushed 1
poor 1
gretel 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
oven 1
from 1
which 1
flames 1
of 1
fire 1
were 1
already 1
darting 1
creep 1
in 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
properly 1
heated 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
put 1
the 1
bread 1
in 1
and 1
once 1
gretel 1
was 1
inside 1
she 1
intended 1
to 1
shut 1
the 1
oven 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
bake 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
eat 1
her 1
too 1
but 1
gretel 1
saw 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
how 1
do 1
i 1
get 1
in 1
silly 1
goose 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
the 1
door 1
is 1
big 1
enough 1
just 1
look 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
in 1
myself 1
and 1
she 1
crept 1
up 1
and 1
thrust 1
her 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
oven 1
then 1
gretel 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
push 1
that 1
drove 1
her 1
far 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
and 1
fastened 1
the 1
bolt 1
oh 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
howl 1
quite 1
horribly 1
but 1
gretel 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
godless 1
witch 1
was 1
miserably 1
burnt 1
to 1
death 1
gretel 1
however 1
ran 1
like 1
lightning 1
to 1
hansel 1
opened 1
his 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
cried 1
hansel 1
we 1
are 1
saved 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
is 1
dead 1
then 1
hansel 1
sprang 1
like 1
a 1
bird 1
from 1
its 1
cage 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
is 1
opened 1
how 1
they 1
did 1
rejoice 1
and 1
embrace 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
dance 1
about 1
and 1
kiss 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
need 1
to 1
fear 1
her 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
witchs 1
house 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
corner 1
there 1
stood 1
chests 1
full 1
of 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
these 1
are 1
far 1
better 1
than 1
pebbles 1
said 1
hansel 1
and 1
thrust 1
into 1
his 1
pockets 1
whatever 1
could 1
be 1
got 1
in 1
and 1
gretel 1
said 1
i 1
too 1
will 1
take 1
something 1
home 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
filled 1
her 1
pinafore 1
full 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
off 1
said 1
hansel 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
witchs 1
forest 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
two 1
hours 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
stretch 1
of 1
water 1
we 1
cannot 1
cross 1
said 1
hansel 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
footplank 1
and 1
no 1
bridge 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
also 1
no 1
ferry 1
answered 1
gretel 1
but 1
a 1
white 1
duck 1
is 1
swimming 1
there 1
if 1
i 1
ask 1
her 1
she 1
will 1
help 1
us 1
over 1
then 1
she 1
cried 1
little 1
duck 1
little 1
duck 1
dost 1
thou 1
see 1
hansel 1
and 1
gretel 1
are 1
waiting 1
for 1
thee 1
theres 1
never 1
a 1
plank 1
or 1
bridge 1
in 1
sight 1
take 1
us 1
across 1
on 1
thy 1
back 1
so 1
white 1
the 1
duck 1
came 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
hansel 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
sister 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
him 1
no 1
replied 1
gretel 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
duck 1
she 1
shall 1
take 1
us 1
across 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
good 1
little 1
duck 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
once 1
safely 1
across 1
and 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
forest 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
familiar 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
they 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
their 1
fathers 1
house 1
then 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
parlour 1
and 1
threw 1
themselves 1
round 1
their 1
fathers 1
neck 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
one 1
happy 1
hour 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
woman 1
however 1
was 1
dead 1
gretel 1
emptied 1
her 1
pinafore 1
until 1
pearls 1
and 1
precious 1
stones 1
ran 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
hansel 1
threw 1
one 1
handful 1
after 1
another 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
them 1
then 1
all 1
anxiety 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
together 1
in 1
perfect 1
happiness 1
my 1
tale 1
is 1
done 1
there 1
runs 1
a 1
mouse 1
whosoever 1
catches 1
it 1
may 1
make 1
himself 1
a 1
big 1
fur 1
cap 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
mouse 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
sausage 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
mouse 1
a 1
bird 1
and 1
a 1
sausage 1
entered 1
into 1
partnership 1
and 1
set 1
up 1
house 1
together 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
all 1
went 1
well 1
they 1
lived 1
in 1
great 1
comfort 1
and 1
prospered 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
add 1
considerably 1
to 1
their 1
stores 1
the 1
birds 1
duty 1
was 1
to 1
fly 1
daily 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
bring 1
in 1
fuel 1
the 1
mouse 1
fetched 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
sausage 1
saw 1
to 1
the 1
cooking 1
when 1
people 1
are 1
too 1
well 1
off 1
they 1
always 1
begin 1
to 1
long 1
for 1
something 1
new 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
while 1
out 1
one 1
day 1
met 1
a 1
fellow 1
bird 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
boastfully 1
expatiated 1
on 1
the 1
excellence 1
of 1
his 1
household 1
arrangements 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
bird 1
sneered 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
poor 1
simpleton 1
who 1
did 1
all 1
the 1
hard 1
work 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
stayed 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
when 1
the 1
mouse 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
she 1
could 1
retire 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
room 1
and 1
rest 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
set 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
sausage 1
had 1
only 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
pot 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
food 1
was 1
properly 1
cooked 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
near 1
dinnertime 1
he 1
just 1
threw 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
broth 1
or 1
rolled 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
vegetables 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
times 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
were 1
buttered 1
and 1
salted 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
served 1
then 1
when 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
laid 1
aside 1
his 1
burden 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
table 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
finished 1
their 1
meal 1
they 1
could 1
sleep 1
their 1
fill 1
till 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
delightful 1
life 1
influenced 1
by 1
those 1
remarks 1
the 1
bird 1
next 1
morning 1
refused 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
telling 1
the 1
others 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
their 1
servant 1
long 1
enough 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
fool 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
change 1
and 1
to 1
try 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
arranging 1
the 1
work 1
beg 1
and 1
pray 1
as 1
the 1
mouse 1
and 1
the 1
sausage 1
might 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
the 1
bird 1
remained 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
and 1
the 1
venture 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
they 1
therefore 1
drew 1
lots 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
sausage 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
to 1
cook 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
bird 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
now 1
what 1
happened 1
the 1
sausage 1
started 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
wood 1
the 1
bird 1
made 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
mouse 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
pot 1
and 1
then 1
these 1
two 1
waited 1
till 1
the 1
sausage 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
fuel 1
for 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
but 1
the 1
sausage 1
remained 1
so 1
long 1
away 1
that 1
they 1
became 1
uneasy 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
out 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
flown 1
far 1
however 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
across 1
a 1
dog 1
who 1
having 1
met 1
the 1
sausage 1
had 1
regarded 1
him 1
as 1
his 1
legitimate 1
booty 1
and 1
so 1
seized 1
and 1
swallowed 1
him 1
the 1
bird 1
complained 1
to 1
the 1
dog 1
of 1
this 1
barefaced 1
robbery 1
but 1
nothing 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
of 1
any 1
avail 1
for 1
the 1
dog 1
answered 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
false 1
credentials 1
on 1
the 1
sausage 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
been 1
forfeited 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
flew 1
sadly 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
mouse 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
and 1
heard 1
they 1
were 1
both 1
very 1
unhappy 1
but 1
agreed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
things 1
and 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
bird 1
set 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
mouse 1
looked 1
after 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
wishing 1
to 1
prepare 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
sausage 1
by 1
rolling 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
vegetables 1
to 1
salt 1
and 1
butter 1
them 1
she 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
pot 1
but 1
she 1
stopped 1
short 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
bottom 1
having 1
already 1
parted 1
not 1
only 1
with 1
her 1
skin 1
and 1
hair 1
but 1
also 1
with 1
life 1
presently 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
serve 1
up 1
the 1
dinner 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
nowhere 1
see 1
the 1
cook 1
in 1
his 1
alarm 1
and 1
flurry 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
wood 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
about 1
the 1
floor 1
called 1
and 1
searched 1
but 1
no 1
cook 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
then 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
carelessly 1
thrown 1
down 1
caught 1
fire 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
blaze 1
the 1
bird 1
hastened 1
to 1
fetch 1
some 1
water 1
but 1
his 1
pail 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
he 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
recover 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
drowned 1
mother 1
holle 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
widow 1
who 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
beautiful 1
and 1
industrious 1
the 1
other 1
ugly 1
and 1
lazy 1
the 1
mother 1
however 1
loved 1
the 1
ugly 1
and 1
lazy 1
one 1
best 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
other 1
who 1
was 1
only 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
the 1
cinderella 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
her 1
stepmother 1
sent 1
her 1
out 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
high 1
road 1
there 1
to 1
spin 1
until 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
fingers 1
bleed 1
now 1
it 1
chanced 1
one 1
day 1
that 1
some 1
blood 1
fell 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
spindle 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
stopped 1
over 1
the 1
well 1
to 1
wash 1
it 1
off 1
the 1
spindle 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
she 1
ran 1
home 1
crying 1
to 1
tell 1
of 1
her 1
misfortune 1
but 1
her 1
stepmother 1
spoke 1
harshly 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
after 1
giving 1
her 1
a 1
violent 1
scolding 1
said 1
unkindly 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
let 1
the 1
spindle 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
yourself 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
out 1
the 1
girl 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
her 1
distress 1
she 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
after 1
the 1
spindle 1
she 1
remembered 1
nothing 1
more 1
until 1
she 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
in 1
a 1
beautiful 1
meadow 1
full 1
of 1
sunshine 1
and 1
with 1
countless 1
flowers 1
blooming 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
she 1
walked 1
over 1
the 1
meadow 1
and 1
presently 1
she 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
bakers 1
oven 1
full 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
the 1
loaves 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
or 1
alas 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
a 1
cinder 1
we 1
were 1
baked 1
through 1
long 1
ago 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
breadshovel 1
and 1
drew 1
them 1
all 1
out 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
full 1
of 1
apples 1
shake 1
me 1
shake 1
me 1
i 1
pray 1
cried 1
the 1
tree 1
my 1
apples 1
one 1
and 1
all 1
are 1
ripe 1
so 1
she 1
shook 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
apples 1
came 1
falling 1
down 1
upon 1
her 1
like 1
rain 1
but 1
she 1
continued 1
shaking 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
apple 1
left 1
upon 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
carefully 1
gathered 1
the 1
apples 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
heap 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
thing 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
house 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
looking 1
out 1
with 1
such 1
large 1
teeth 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
called 1
after 1
her 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
afraid 1
of 1
dear 1
child 1
stay 1
with 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
house 1
properly 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
make 1
you 1
very 1
happy 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
careful 1
however 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
way 1
for 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
thoroughly 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
fly 1
about 1
then 1
they 1
say 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
snowing 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
mother 1
holle 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
spoke 1
so 1
kindly 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
summoned 1
up 1
courage 1
and 1
agreed 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
her 1
service 1
she 1
took 1
care 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
womans 1
bidding 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
she 1
made 1
the 1
bed 1
she 1
shook 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
might 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
flew 1
about 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
snowflakes 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
her 1
word 1
she 1
never 1
spoke 1
angrily 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
roast 1
and 1
boiled 1
meats 1
every 1
day 1
so 1
she 1
stayed 1
on 1
with 1
mother 1
holle 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
unhappy 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
first 1
tell 1
why 1
she 1
felt 1
sad 1
but 1
she 1
became 1
conscious 1
at 1
last 1
of 1
great 1
longing 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
she 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
homesick 1
although 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
better 1
off 1
with 1
mother 1
holle 1
than 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
after 1
waiting 1
awhile 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
mother 1
holle 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
homesick 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
stay 1
with 1
you 1
any 1
longer 1
for 1
although 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
happy 1
here 1
i 1
must 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
people 1
then 1
mother 1
holle 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
pleased 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
people 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
served 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
and 1
faithfully 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
home 1
myself 1
thereupon 1
she 1
led 1
the 1
girl 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
broad 1
gateway 1
the 1
gate 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
shower 1
of 1
gold 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
clung 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
it 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
reward 1
for 1
your 1
industry 1
said 1
mother 1
holle 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
she 1
handed 1
her 1
the 1
spindle 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
dropped 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
the 1
gate 1
was 1
then 1
closed 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
found 1
herself 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
world 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
mothers 1
house 1
as 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
courtyard 1
the 1
cock 1
who 1
was 1
perched 1
on 1
the 1
well 1
called 1
out 1
cockadoodledoo 1
your 1
golden 1
daughters 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
richly 1
covered 1
with 1
gold 1
they 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
warm 1
welcome 1
she 1
related 1
to 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
mother 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
by 1
her 1
great 1
riches 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
should 1
like 1
her 1
ugly 1
lazy 1
daughter 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
her 1
fortune 1
so 1
she 1
made 1
the 1
sister 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
spin 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
pricked 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
thrust 1
her 1
hand 1
into 1
a 1
thornbush 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
drop 1
some 1
blood 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
spindle 1
then 1
she 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
jumped 1
in 1
herself 1
like 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
beautiful 1
meadow 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
it 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
oven 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
or 1
alas 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
a 1
cinder 1
we 1
were 1
baked 1
through 1
long 1
ago 1
cried 1
the 1
loaves 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
lazy 1
girl 1
answered 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
dirty 1
my 1
hands 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
presently 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
appletree 1
shake 1
me 1
shake 1
me 1
i 1
pray 1
my 1
apples 1
one 1
and 1
all 1
are 1
ripe 1
it 1
cried 1
but 1
she 1
only 1
answered 1
a 1
nice 1
thing 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
might 1
fall 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
mother 1
holles 1
house 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
large 1
teeth 1
from 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
engaged 1
herself 1
without 1
delay 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
obedient 1
and 1
industrious 1
and 1
exerted 1
herself 1
to 1
please 1
mother 1
holle 1
for 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
she 1
should 1
get 1
in 1
return 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
however 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
dawdle 1
over 1
her 1
work 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
more 1
idle 1
still 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
mornings 1
and 1
refused 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
worse 1
still 1
she 1
neglected 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
old 1
womans 1
bed 1
properly 1
and 1
forgot 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
might 1
fly 1
about 1
so 1
mother 1
holle 1
very 1
soon 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
she 1
might 1
go 1
the 1
lazy 1
girl 1
was 1
delighted 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
the 1
gold 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
mine 1
mother 1
holle 1
led 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
led 1
her 1
sister 1
to 1
the 1
broad 1
gateway 1
but 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
passing 1
through 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
shower 1
of 1
gold 1
a 1
great 1
bucketful 1
of 1
pitch 1
came 1
pouring 1
over 1
her 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
your 1
services 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
she 1
shut 1
the 1
gate 1
so 1
the 1
lazy 1
girl 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
covered 1
with 1
pitch 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
on 1
the 1
well 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
her 1
cockadoodledoo 1
your 1
dirty 1
daughters 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
try 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
the 1
pitch 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
stuck 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
lived 1
little 1
redcap 1
little 1
red 1
riding 1
hood 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dear 1
little 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
loved 1
by 1
everyone 1
who 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
but 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
by 1
her 1
grandmother 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
once 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
cap 1
of 1
red 1
velvet 1
which 1
suited 1
her 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
wear 1
anything 1
else 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
called 1
little 1
redcap 1
one 1
day 1
her 1
mother 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
come 1
little 1
redcap 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
take 1
them 1
to 1
your 1
grandmother 1
she 1
is 1
ill 1
and 1
weak 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
do 1
her 1
good 1
set 1
out 1
before 1
it 1
gets 1
hot 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
walk 1
nicely 1
and 1
quietly 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
run 1
off 1
the 1
path 1
or 1
you 1
may 1
fall 1
and 1
break 1
the 1
bottle 1
and 1
then 1
your 1
grandmother 1
will 1
get 1
nothing 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
her 1
room 1
dont 1
forget 1
to 1
say 1
good 1
morning 1
and 1
dont 1
peep 1
into 1
every 1
corner 1
before 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
great 1
care 1
said 1
little 1
redcap 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
it 1
the 1
grandmother 1
lived 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
half 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
little 1
redcap 1
entered 1
the 1
wood 1
a 1
wolf 1
met 1
her 1
redcap 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
a 1
wicked 1
creature 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
good 1
day 1
little 1
redcap 1
said 1
he 1
thank 1
you 1
kindly 1
wolf 1
whither 1
away 1
so 1
early 1
little 1
redcap 1
to 1
my 1
grandmothers 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
in 1
your 1
apron 1
cake 1
and 1
wine 1
yesterday 1
was 1
bakingday 1
so 1
poor 1
sick 1
grandmother 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
good 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
stronger 1
where 1
does 1
your 1
grandmother 1
live 1
little 1
redcap 1
a 1
good 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
league 1
farther 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
her 1
house 1
stands 1
under 1
the 1
three 1
large 1
oaktrees 1
the 1
nuttrees 1
are 1
just 1
below 1
you 1
surely 1
must 1
know 1
it 1
replied 1
little 1
redcap 1
the 1
wolf 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
what 1
a 1
tender 1
young 1
creature 1
what 1
a 1
nice 1
plump 1
mouthfulshe 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
eat 1
than 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
i 1
must 1
act 1
craftily 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
catch 1
both 1
so 1
he 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
little 1
redcap 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
see 1
little 1
redcap 1
how 1
pretty 1
the 1
flowers 1
are 1
about 1
herewhy 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
i 1
believe 1
too 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
how 1
sweetly 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
are 1
singing 1
you 1
walk 1
gravely 1
along 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
school 1
while 1
everything 1
else 1
out 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
is 1
merry 1
little 1
redcap 1
raised 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
sunbeams 1
dancing 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
pretty 1
flowers 1
growing 1
everywhere 1
she 1
thought 1
suppose 1
i 1
take 1
grandmother 1
a 1
fresh 1
nosegay 1
that 1
would 1
please 1
her 1
too 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
still 1
get 1
there 1
in 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
flowers 1
and 1
whenever 1
she 1
had 1
picked 1
one 1
she 1
fancied 1
that 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
still 1
prettier 1
one 1
farther 1
on 1
and 1
ran 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
got 1
deeper 1
and 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
wolf 1
ran 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
grandmothers 1
house 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
who 1
is 1
there 1
little 1
redcap 1
replied 1
the 1
wolf 1
she 1
is 1
bringing 1
cake 1
and 1
wine 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
lift 1
the 1
latch 1
called 1
out 1
the 1
grandmother 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
weak 1
and 1
cannot 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
wolf 1
lifted 1
the 1
latch 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
he 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
grandmothers 1
bed 1
and 1
devoured 1
her 1
then 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
clothes 1
dressed 1
himself 1
in 1
her 1
cap 1
laid 1
himself 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
curtains 1
little 1
redcap 1
however 1
had 1
been 1
running 1
about 1
picking 1
flowers 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
gathered 1
so 1
many 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
carry 1
no 1
more 1
she 1
remembered 1
her 1
grandmother 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
cottagedoor 1
standing 1
open 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
strange 1
feeling 1
that 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
oh 1
dear 1
how 1
uneasy 1
i 1
feel 1
today 1
and 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
i 1
like 1
being 1
with 1
grandmother 1
so 1
much 1
she 1
called 1
out 1
good 1
morning 1
but 1
received 1
no 1
answer 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
curtains 1
there 1
lay 1
her 1
grandmother 1
with 1
her 1
cap 1
pulled 1
far 1
over 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
strange 1
oh 1
grandmother 1
she 1
said 1
what 1
big 1
ears 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
better 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
with 1
my 1
child 1
was 1
the 1
reply 1
but 1
grandmother 1
what 1
big 1
eyes 1
you 1
have 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
better 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
with 1
my 1
dear 1
but 1
grandmother 1
what 1
large 1
hands 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
better 1
to 1
hug 1
you 1
with 1
oh 1
but 1
grandmother 1
what 1
a 1
terrible 1
big 1
mouth 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
better 1
to 1
eat 1
you 1
with 1
and 1
scarcely 1
had 1
the 1
wolf 1
said 1
this 1
than 1
with 1
one 1
bound 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
swallowed 1
up 1
redcap 1
when 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
appeased 1
his 1
appetite 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
very 1
loud 1
the 1
huntsman 1
was 1
just 1
passing 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
how 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
is 1
snoring 1
i 1
must 1
just 1
see 1
if 1
she 1
wants 1
anything 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
it 1
do 1
i 1
find 1
you 1
here 1
you 1
old 1
sinner 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
long 1
sought 1
you 1
then 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
fire 1
at 1
him 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
might 1
have 1
devoured 1
the 1
grandmother 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
saved 1
so 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
fire 1
but 1
took 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
scissors 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
stomach 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
wolf 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
two 1
snips 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
little 1
redcap 1
shining 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
made 1
two 1
snips 1
more 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
sprang 1
out 1
crying 1
ah 1
how 1
frightened 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
how 1
dark 1
it 1
was 1
inside 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
aged 1
grandmother 1
came 1
out 1
alive 1
also 1
but 1
scarcely 1
able 1
to 1
breathe 1
redcap 1
however 1
quickly 1
fetched 1
great 1
stones 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
filled 1
the 1
wolfs 1
belly 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
stones 1
were 1
so 1
heavy 1
that 1
he 1
collapsed 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
fell 1
dead 1
then 1
all 1
three 1
were 1
delighted 1
the 1
huntsman 1
drew 1
off 1
the 1
wolfs 1
skin 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
grandmother 1
ate 1
the 1
cake 1
and 1
drank 1
the 1
wine 1
which 1
redcap 1
had 1
brought 1
and 1
revived 1
but 1
redcap 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
live 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
by 1
myself 1
leave 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
my 1
mother 1
has 1
forbidden 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
it 1
also 1
related 1
that 1
once 1
when 1
redcap 1
was 1
again 1
taking 1
cakes 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
grandmother 1
another 1
wolf 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
entice 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
redcap 1
however 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
guard 1
and 1
went 1
straight 1
forward 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
grandmother 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
met 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
good 1
morning 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wicked 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
public 1
road 1
she 1
was 1
certain 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
eaten 1
her 1
up 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
grandmother 1
we 1
will 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
wolf 1
knocked 1
and 1
cried 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
grandmother 1
i 1
am 1
little 1
redcap 1
and 1
am 1
bringing 1
you 1
some 1
cakes 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
or 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
so 1
the 1
greybeard 1
stole 1
twice 1
or 1
thrice 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
jumped 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
intending 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
redcap 1
went 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
steal 1
after 1
her 1
and 1
devour 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
but 1
the 1
grandmother 1
saw 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
thoughts 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
stone 1
trough 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
take 1
the 1
pail 1
redcap 1
i 1
made 1
some 1
sausages 1
yesterday 1
so 1
carry 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
boiled 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
trough 1
redcap 1
carried 1
until 1
the 1
great 1
trough 1
was 1
quite 1
full 1
then 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
sausages 1
reached 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
he 1
sniffed 1
and 1
peeped 1
down 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
neck 1
so 1
far 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
keep 1
his 1
footing 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
slip 1
and 1
slipped 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
roof 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
trough 1
and 1
was 1
drowned 1
but 1
redcap 1
went 1
joyously 1
home 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
ever 1
did 1
anything 1
to 1
harm 1
her 1
again 1
the 1
robber 1
bridegroom 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
miller 1
who 1
had 1
one 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
grown 1
up 1
he 1
was 1
anxious 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
well 1
married 1
and 1
provided 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
suitable 1
man 1
who 1
comes 1
and 1
asks 1
for 1
her 1
hand 1
not 1
long 1
after 1
a 1
suitor 1
appeared 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
could 1
see 1
nothing 1
in 1
him 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
find 1
fault 1
he 1
betrothed 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
girl 1
ought 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
her 1
betrothed 1
husband 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
trust 1
him 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
nor 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
without 1
an 1
inward 1
shudder 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
paid 1
me 1
a 1
visit 1
although 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
betrothed 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
your 1
house 1
is 1
she 1
answered 1
my 1
house 1
is 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
he 1
said 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
excuse 1
herself 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
thither 1
her 1
betrothed 1
only 1
replied 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
next 1
sunday 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
invited 1
guests 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
mistake 1
the 1
way 1
i 1
will 1
strew 1
ashes 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
when 1
sunday 1
came 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
dread 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
which 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
explain 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
path 1
again 1
she 1
filled 1
her 1
pockets 1
with 1
peas 1
and 1
lentils 1
to 1
sprinkle 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
along 1
on 1
reaching 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
path 1
strewed 1
with 1
ashes 1
and 1
these 1
she 1
followed 1
throwing 1
down 1
some 1
peas 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
at 1
every 1
step 1
she 1
took 1
she 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
deepest 1
darkest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
lonely 1
house 1
looking 1
so 1
grim 1
and 1
mysterious 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
please 1
her 1
at 1
all 1
she 1
stepped 1
inside 1
but 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
silence 1
reigned 1
throughout 1
suddenly 1
a 1
voice 1
cried 1
turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
the 1
girl 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
voice 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
bird 1
hanging 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
again 1
it 1
cried 1
turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
the 1
girl 1
passed 1
on 1
going 1
from 1
room 1
to 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
empty 1
and 1
still 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
very 1
very 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
her 1
head 1
from 1
shaking 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
asked 1
the 1
girl 1
if 1
my 1
betrothed 1
husband 1
lives 1
here 1
ah 1
you 1
poor 1
child 1
answered 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
what 1
a 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
murderers 1
den 1
you 1
think 1
yourself 1
a 1
promised 1
bride 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
marriage 1
will 1
soon 1
take 1
place 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
death 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
keep 1
your 1
marriage 1
feast 1
look 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
large 1
cauldron 1
of 1
water 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
have 1
you 1
in 1
their 1
power 1
they 1
will 1
kill 1
you 1
without 1
mercy 1
and 1
cook 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
for 1
they 1
are 1
eaters 1
of 1
men 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
pity 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
save 1
you 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
lost 1
thereupon 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
led 1
her 1
behind 1
a 1
large 1
cask 1
which 1
quite 1
hid 1
her 1
from 1
view 1
keep 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
a 1
mouse 1
she 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
move 1
or 1
speak 1
or 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
you 1
tonight 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
are 1
all 1
asleep 1
we 1
will 1
flee 1
together 1
i 1
have 1
long 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
the 1
godless 1
crew 1
returned 1
dragging 1
another 1
young 1
girl 1
along 1
with 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
drunk 1
and 1
paid 1
no 1
heed 1
to 1
her 1
cries 1
and 1
lamentations 1
they 1
gave 1
her 1
wine 1
to 1
drink 1
three 1
glasses 1
full 1
one 1
of 1
white 1
wine 1
one 1
of 1
red 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
yellow 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
gave 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
died 1
then 1
they 1
tore 1
off 1
her 1
dainty 1
clothing 1
laid 1
her 1
on 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
beautiful 1
body 1
into 1
pieces 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
salt 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
poor 1
betrothed 1
girl 1
crouched 1
trembling 1
and 1
shuddering 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
for 1
she 1
saw 1
what 1
a 1
terrible 1
fate 1
had 1
been 1
intended 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
robbers 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
now 1
noticed 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
still 1
remaining 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
finger 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
girl 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
draw 1
it 1
off 1
easily 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
finger 1
but 1
the 1
finger 1
sprang 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
fell 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
into 1
the 1
lap 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
hiding 1
there 1
the 1
robber 1
took 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
began 1
looking 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
have 1
you 1
looked 1
behind 1
the 1
large 1
cask 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
called 1
out 1
come 1
and 1
eat 1
your 1
suppers 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
thing 1
be 1
till 1
tomorrow 1
the 1
finger 1
wont 1
run 1
away 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
is 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
robbers 1
and 1
they 1
ceased 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
finger 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
then 1
mixed 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
with 1
their 1
wine 1
and 1
before 1
long 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
cellar 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
assured 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
came 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
she 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
step 1
over 1
the 1
bodies 1
of 1
the 1
sleepers 1
who 1
were 1
lying 1
close 1
together 1
and 1
every 1
moment 1
she 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
renewed 1
dread 1
lest 1
she 1
should 1
awaken 1
them 1
but 1
god 1
helped 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
passed 1
safely 1
over 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
went 1
upstairs 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hastened 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
from 1
the 1
murderers 1
den 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
ashes 1
scattered 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
but 1
the 1
peas 1
and 1
lentils 1
had 1
sprouted 1
and 1
grown 1
sufficiently 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
guide 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
all 1
night 1
long 1
they 1
walked 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
before 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
mill 1
then 1
the 1
girl 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
the 1
day 1
came 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
marriage 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
arrived 1
and 1
also 1
a 1
large 1
company 1
of 1
guests 1
for 1
the 1
miller 1
had 1
taken 1
care 1
to 1
invite 1
all 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
relations 1
as 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
each 1
guest 1
in 1
turn 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
tale 1
the 1
bride 1
sat 1
still 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
you 1
my 1
love 1
said 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
turning 1
to 1
her 1
is 1
there 1
no 1
tale 1
you 1
know 1
tell 1
us 1
something 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1

dream 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
bride 1
i 1
went 1
alone 1
through 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
could 1
i 1
find 1
within 1
but 1
a 1
bird 1
that 1
was 1
hanging 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
cried 1
turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
and 1
again 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
it 1
said 1
these 1
words 1
my 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
i 1
went 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
house 1
from 1
room 1
to 1
room 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
empty 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
so 1
grim 1
and 1
mysterious 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
very 1
very 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
her 1
head 1
still 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
my 1
betrothed 1
lived 1
here 1
and 1
she 1
answered 1
ah 1
you 1
poor 1
child 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
murderers 1
den 1
your 1
betrothed 1
does 1
indeed 1
live 1
here 1
but 1
he 1
will 1
kill 1
you 1
without 1
mercy 1
and 1
afterwards 1
cook 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
my 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
hid 1
me 1
behind 1
a 1
large 1
cask 1
and 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
done 1
this 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
returned 1
home 1
dragging 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
along 1
with 1
them 1
they 1
gave 1
her 1
three 1
kinds 1
of 1
wine 1
to 1
drink 1
white 1
red 1
and 1
yellow 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
my 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
then 1
they 1
tore 1
off 1
her 1
dainty 1
clothing 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
beautiful 1
body 1
into 1
pieces 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
salt 1
upon 1
it 1
my 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
robbers 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
still 1
left 1
on 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
draw 1
off 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
finger 1
but 1
the 1
finger 1
sprang 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
fell 1
behind 1
the 1
great 1
cask 1
into 1
my 1
lap 1
and 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
finger 1
with 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
with 1
these 1
words 1
the 1
bride 1
drew 1
forth 1
the 1
finger 1
and 1
shewed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
assembled 1
guests 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
who 1
during 1
this 1
recital 1
had 1
grown 1
deadly 1
pale 1
up 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
escape 1
but 1
the 1
guests 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
fast 1
they 1
delivered 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
justice 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
murderous 1
band 1
were 1
condemned 1
to 1
death 1
for 1
their 1
wicked 1
deeds 1
tom 1
thumb 1
a 1
poor 1
woodman 1
sat 1
in 1
his 1
cottage 1
one 1
night 1
smoking 1
his 1
pipe 1
by 1
the 1
fireside 1
while 1
his 1
wife 1
sat 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
spinning 1
how 1
lonely 1
it 1
is 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
puffed 1
out 1
a 1
long 1
curl 1
of 1
smoke 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
by 1
ourselves 1
without 1
any 1
children 1
to 1
play 1
about 1
and 1
amuse 1
us 1
while 1
other 1
people 1
seem 1
so 1
happy 1
and 1
merry 1
with 1
their 1
children 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
is 1
very 1
true 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
sighing 1
and 1
turning 1
round 1
her 1
wheel 1
how 1
happy 1
should 1
i 1
be 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
child 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
ever 1
so 1
smallnay 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
no 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
thumbi 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
and 1
love 1
it 1
dearly 1
nowodd 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
itit 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
this 1
good 1
womans 1
wish 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
just 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
way 1
she 1
had 1
wished 1
it 1
for 1
not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
quite 1
healthy 1
and 1
strong 1
but 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
thumb 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
well 1
we 1
cannot 1
say 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
what 1
we 1
wished 1
for 1
and 1
little 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
we 1
will 1
love 1
him 1
dearly 1
and 1
they 1
called 1
him 1
thomas 1
thumb 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
of 1
food 1
yet 1
for 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
he 1
never 1
grew 1
bigger 1
but 1
kept 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
size 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
born 1
still 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
sharp 1
and 1
sparkling 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
showed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
clever 1
little 1
fellow 1
who 1
always 1
knew 1
well 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
the 1
woodman 1
was 1
getting 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
cut 1
fuel 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
someone 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
cart 1
after 1
me 1
for 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
haste 1
oh 1
father 1
cried 1
tom 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
woodman 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
you 1
cannot 1
reach 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
horses 1
bridle 1
never 1
mind 1
that 1
father 1
said 1
tom 1
if 1
my 1
mother 1
will 1
only 1
harness 1
the 1
horse 1
i 1
will 1
get 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
which 1
way 1
to 1
go 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
for 1
once 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
the 1
mother 1
harnessed 1
the 1
horse 1
to 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
put 1
tom 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
there 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
told 1
the 1
beast 1
how 1
to 1
go 1
crying 1
out 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
stop 1
as 1
he 1
wanted 1
and 1
thus 1
the 1
horse 1
went 1
on 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
woodman 1
had 1
driven 1
it 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
as 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
going 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
fast 1
and 1
tom 1
was 1
calling 1
out 1
gently 1
gently 1
two 1
strangers 1
came 1
up 1
what 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
that 1
is 1
said 1
one 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
cart 1
going 1
along 1
and 1
i 1
hear 1
a 1
carter 1
talking 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
but 1
yet 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
no 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
queer 1
indeed 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
let 1
us 1
follow 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
it 1
goes 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
woodman 1
was 1
then 1
tom 1
thumb 1
seeing 1
his 1
father 1
cried 1
out 1
see 1
father 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
with 1
the 1
cart 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
safe 1
now 1
take 1
me 1
down 1
so 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
horse 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
took 1
his 1
son 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
horses 1
ear 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
straw 1
where 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
merry 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
the 1
two 1
strangers 1
were 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
looking 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
wonder 1
at 1
last 1
one 1
took 1
the 1
other 1
aside 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
little 1
urchin 1
will 1
make 1
our 1
fortune 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
him 1
and 1
carry 1
him 1
about 1
from 1
town 1
to 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
show 1
we 1
must 1
buy 1
him 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
off 1
said 1
they 1
with 1
us 1
than 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
wont 1
sell 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
my 1
own 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
is 1
dearer 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
silver 1
and 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
tom 1
hearing 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
make 1
crept 1
up 1
his 1
fathers 1
coat 1
to 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
take 1
the 1
money 1
father 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
have 1
me 1
ill 1
soon 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
so 1
the 1
woodman 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
sell 1
tom 1
to 1
the 1
strangers 1
for 1
a 1
large 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
they 1
paid 1
the 1
price 1
where 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
sit 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
oh 1
put 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
rim 1
of 1
your 1
hat 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
gallery 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
can 1
walk 1
about 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
along 1
so 1
they 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
wished 1
and 1
when 1
tom 1
had 1
taken 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
they 1
journeyed 1
on 1
till 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
dusky 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
said 1
let 1
me 1
get 1
down 1
im 1
tired 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
clod 1
of 1
earth 1
in 1
a 1
ploughed 1
field 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
but 1
tom 1
ran 1
about 1
amongst 1
the 1
furrows 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
slipped 1
into 1
an 1
old 1
mousehole 1
good 1
night 1
my 1
masters 1
said 1
he 1
im 1
off 1
mind 1
and 1
look 1
sharp 1
after 1
me 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
then 1
they 1
ran 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
poked 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
their 1
sticks 1
into 1
the 1
mousehole 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
tom 1
only 1
crawled 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
in 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
became 1
quite 1
dark 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
their 1
way 1
without 1
their 1
prize 1
as 1
sulky 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
when 1
tom 1
found 1
they 1
were 1
gone 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
hidingplace 1
what 1
dangerous 1
walking 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
he 1
in 1
this 1
ploughed 1
field 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
fall 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
great 1
clods 1
i 1
should 1
undoubtedly 1
break 1
my 1
neck 1
at 1
last 1
by 1
good 1
luck 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
large 1
empty 1
snailshell 1
this 1
is 1
lucky 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
can 1
sleep 1
here 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
in 1
he 1
crept 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
falling 1
asleep 1
he 1
heard 1
two 1
men 1
passing 1
by 1
chatting 1
together 1
and 1
one 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
how 1
can 1
we 1
rob 1
that 1
rich 1
parsons 1
house 1
of 1
his 1
silver 1
and 1
gold 1
ill 1
tell 1
you 1
cried 1
tom 1
what 1
noise 1
was 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
frightened 1
im 1
sure 1
i 1
heard 1
someone 1
speak 1
they 1
stood 1
still 1
listening 1
and 1
tom 1
said 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
ill 1
soon 1
show 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
parsons 1
money 1
but 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
said 1
they 1
look 1
about 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
answered 1
he 1
and 1
listen 1
where 1
the 1
sound 1
comes 1
from 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
thieves 1
found 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
lifted 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
you 1
little 1
urchin 1
they 1
said 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
for 1
us 1
why 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
between 1
the 1
iron 1
windowbars 1
of 1
the 1
parsons 1
house 1
and 1
throw 1
you 1
out 1
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
thats 1
a 1
good 1
thought 1
said 1
the 1
thieves 1
come 1
along 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
parsons 1
house 1
tom 1
slipped 1
through 1
the 1
windowbars 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
bawl 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
here 1
at 1
this 1
the 1
thieves 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
softly 1
softly 1
speak 1
low 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
awaken 1
anybody 1
but 1
tom 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
bawled 1
out 1
again 1
how 1
much 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
shall 1
i 1
throw 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
now 1
the 1
cook 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
and 1
hearing 1
a 1
noise 1
she 1
raised 1
herself 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
bed 1
and 1
listened 1
meantime 1
the 1
thieves 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
plucked 1
up 1
their 1
hearts 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
urchin 1
is 1
only 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
fools 1
of 1
us 1
so 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
whispered 1
softly 1
to 1
him 1
saying 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
roguish 1
jokes 1
but 1
throw 1
us 1
out 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
then 1
tom 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
very 1
well 1
hold 1
your 1
hands 1
here 1
it 1
comes 1
the 1
cook 1
heard 1
this 1
quite 1
plain 1
so 1
she 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
ran 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
thieves 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
at 1
their 1
tails 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
having 1
groped 1
about 1
and 1
found 1
nothing 1
went 1
away 1
for 1
a 1
light 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
came 1
back 1
tom 1
had 1
slipped 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
barn 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
searched 1
every 1
hole 1
and 1
corner 1
and 1
found 1
nobody 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
thinking 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
dreaming 1
with 1
her 1
eyes 1
open 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
crawled 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
hayloft 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
found 1
a 1
snug 1
place 1
to 1
finish 1
his 1
nights 1
rest 1
in 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
meaning 1
to 1
sleep 1
till 1
daylight 1
and 1
then 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
but 1
alas 1
how 1
woefully 1
he 1
was 1
undone 1
what 1
crosses 1
and 1
sorrows 1
happen 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
the 1
cook 1
got 1
up 1
early 1
before 1
daybreak 1
to 1
feed 1
the 1
cows 1
and 1
going 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
hayloft 1
carried 1
away 1
a 1
large 1
bundle 1
of 1
hay 1
with 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
fast 1
asleep 1
he 1
still 1
however 1
slept 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
awake 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cow 1
for 1
the 1
cook 1
had 1
put 1
the 1
hay 1
into 1
the 1
cows 1
rick 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
had 1
taken 1
tom 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
it 1
good 1
lackaday 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
came 1
i 1
to 1
tumble 1
into 1
the 1
mill 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
found 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
have 1
all 1
his 1
wits 1
about 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
get 1
between 1
the 1
cows 1
teeth 1
and 1
so 1
be 1
crushed 1
to 1
death 1
at 1
last 1
down 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
stomach 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
dark 1
said 1
he 1
they 1
forgot 1
to 1
build 1
windows 1
in 1
this 1
room 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
sun 1
in 1
a 1
candle 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
bad 1
thing 1
though 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
bad 1
luck 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
his 1
quarters 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
hay 1
was 1
always 1
coming 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
space 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
became 1
smaller 1
and 1
smaller 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
dont 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
dont 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
the 1
maid 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
then 1
milking 1
the 1
cow 1
and 1
hearing 1
someone 1
speak 1
but 1
seeing 1
nobody 1
and 1
yet 1
being 1
quite 1
sure 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
voice 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
off 1
her 1
stool 1
and 1
overset 1
the 1
milkpail 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
pick 1
herself 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
dirt 1
she 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
the 1
parson 1
and 1
said 1
sir 1
sir 1
the 1
cow 1
is 1
talking 1
but 1
the 1
parson 1
said 1
woman 1
thou 1
art 1
surely 1
mad 1
however 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cowhouse 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
scarcely 1
had 1
they 1
set 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
when 1
tom 1
called 1
out 1
dont 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
then 1
the 1
parson 1
himself 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
thinking 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
surely 1
bewitched 1
told 1
his 1
man 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
so 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
killed 1
and 1
cut 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
stomach 1
in 1
which 1
tom 1
lay 1
was 1
thrown 1
out 1
upon 1
a 1
dunghill 1
tom 1
soon 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
easy 1
task 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
room 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
fresh 1
illluck 1
befell 1
him 1
a 1
hungry 1
wolf 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
swallowed 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
stomach 1
with 1
tom 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
one 1
gulp 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
tom 1
however 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
disheartened 1
and 1
thinking 1
the 1
wolf 1
would 1
not 1
dislike 1
having 1
some 1
chat 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
along 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
my 1
good 1
friend 1
i 1
can 1
show 1
you 1
a 1
famous 1
treat 1
wheres 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
in 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
house 1
said 1
tom 1
describing 1
his 1
own 1
fathers 1
house 1
you 1
can 1
crawl 1
through 1
the 1
drain 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
then 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
and 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
cakes 1
ham 1
beef 1
cold 1
chicken 1
roast 1
pig 1
appledumplings 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
your 1
heart 1
can 1
wish 1
the 1
wolf 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
asked 1
twice 1
so 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
crawled 1
through 1
the 1
drain 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
then 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
there 1
to 1
his 1
hearts 1
content 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
enough 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
this 1
was 1
just 1
what 1
tom 1
had 1
reckoned 1
upon 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
shout 1
making 1
all 1
the 1
noise 1
he 1
could 1
will 1
you 1
be 1
easy 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
youll 1
awaken 1
everybody 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
if 1
you 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
clatter 1
whats 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1

have 1
had 1
your 1
frolic 1
now 1
ive 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
merry 1
myself 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
singing 1
and 1
shouting 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
being 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
noise 1
peeped 1
through 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
there 1
you 1
may 1
well 1
suppose 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
sadly 1
frightened 1
and 1
the 1
woodman 1
ran 1
for 1
his 1
axe 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
wife 1
a 1
scythe 1
do 1
you 1
stay 1
behind 1
said 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
knocked 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
you 1
must 1
rip 1
him 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
scythe 1
tom 1
heard 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
father 1
father 1
i 1
am 1
here 1
the 1
wolf 1
has 1
swallowed 1
me 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
said 1
heaven 1
be 1
praised 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
our 1
dear 1
child 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
his 1
wife 1
not 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
scythe 1
for 1
fear 1
she 1
should 1
hurt 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
aimed 1
a 1
great 1
blow 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
wolf 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
they 1
cut 1
open 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
set 1
tommy 1
free 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
what 1
fears 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
for 1
you 1
yes 1
father 1
answered 1
he 1
i 1
have 1
travelled 1

over 1
the 1
world 1
i 1

in 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
other 1
since 1
we 1
parted 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1

home 1
and 1

his 1
father 1
i 1

for 1

world 1
then 1
they 1
hugged 1
and 1
kissed 1
their 1
dear 1
little 1
son 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
hungry 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
fetched 1
new 1
clothes 1
for 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
old 1
ones 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
spoiled 1
on 1
his 1
journey 1
so 1
master 1
thumb 1
stayed 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
in 1
peace 1
for 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
traveller 1
and 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
seen 1
so 1
many 1
fine 1
things 1
and 1
was 1
fond 1
enough 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
he 1
always 1
agreed 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
theres 1
no 1
place 1
like 1
home 1
rumpelstiltskin 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
wood 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
ran 1
a 1
fine 1
stream 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
stream 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
mill 1
the 1
millers 1
house 1
was 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
she 1
was 1
moreover 1
very 1
shrewd 1
and 1
clever 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
so 1
proud 1
of 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
one 1
day 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
hunt 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
could 1
spin 1
gold 1
out 1
of 1
straw 1
now 1
this 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
millers 1
boast 1
his 1
greediness 1
was 1
raised 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
before 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
a 1
chamber 1
in 1
his 1
palace 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
heap 1
of 1
straw 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
spinningwheel 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
spun 1
into 1
gold 1
before 1
morning 1
as 1
you 1
love 1
your 1
life 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
maiden 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
silly 1
boast 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
for 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
spin 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
the 1
chamber 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
bewail 1
her 1
hard 1
fate 1
when 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
drolllooking 1
little 1
man 1
hobbled 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
morrow 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
good 1
lass 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
weeping 1
for 1
alas 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
must 1
spin 1
this 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
hobgoblin 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
my 1
necklace 1
replied 1
the 1
maiden 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
at 1
her 1
word 1
and 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
wheel 1
and 1
whistled 1
and 1
sang 1
round 1
about 1
round 1
about 1
lo 1
and 1
behold 1
reel 1
away 1
reel 1
away 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
wheel 1
went 1
merrily 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
quickly 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
straw 1
was 1
all 1
spun 1
into 1
gold 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
and 1
pleased 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
grew 1
still 1
more 1
greedy 1
of 1
gain 1
and 1
he 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
poor 1
millers 1
daughter 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
fresh 1
task 1
then 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
weep 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
soon 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
your 1
task 1
the 1
ring 1
on 1
my 1
finger 1
said 1
she 1
so 1
her 1
little 1
friend 1
took 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
the 1
wheel 1
again 1
and 1
whistled 1
and 1
sang 1
round 1
about 1
round 1
about 1
lo 1
and 1
behold 1
reel 1
away 1
reel 1
away 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
till 1
long 1
before 1
morning 1
all 1
was 1
done 1
again 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
greatly 1
delighted 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
this 1
glittering 1
treasure 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
enough 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
millers 1
daughter 1
to 1
a 1
yet 1
larger 1
heap 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
spun 1
tonight 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
queen 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
alone 1
that 1
dwarf 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
spin 1
gold 1
for 1
you 1
this 1
third 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
left 1
said 1
she 1
then 1
say 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
child 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
queen 1
that 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
thought 1
the 1
millers 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
knew 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
her 1
task 1
done 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
asked 1
round 1
went 1
the 1
wheel 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
song 1
and 1
the 1
manikin 1
once 1
more 1
spun 1
the 1
heap 1
into 1
gold 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
finding 1
all 1
he 1
wanted 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
so 1
he 1
married 1
the 1
millers 1
daughter 1
and 1
she 1
really 1
became 1
queen 1
at 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
her 1
first 1
little 1
child 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
room 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
sitting 1
playing 1
with 1
her 1
baby 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
in 1
mind 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
grieved 1
sorely 1
at 1
her 1
misfortune 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
wealth 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
her 1
off 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
her 1
tears 1
softened 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
three 1
days 1
grace 1
and 1
if 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
my 1
name 1
you 1
shall 1
keep 1
your 1
child 1
now 1
the 1
queen 1
lay 1
awake 1
all 1
night 1
thinking 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
odd 1
names 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
and 1
she 1
sent 1
messengers 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
land 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
new 1
ones 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
began 1
with 1
timothy 1
ichabod 1
benjamin 1
jeremiah 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
names 1
she 1
could 1
remember 1
but 1
to 1
all 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
said 1
madam 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
name 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
she 1
began 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
comical 1
names 1
she 1
could 1
hear 1
of 1
bandylegs 1
hunchback 1
crookshanks 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
gentleman 1
still 1
said 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
madam 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
name 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
messengers 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
travelled 1
two 1
days 1
without 1
hearing 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
names 1
but 1
yesterday 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
climbing 1
a 1
high 1
hill 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
hare 1

each 1
other 1

i 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
hut 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
hut 1
burnt 1
a 1
fire 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
fire 1
a 1
funny 1
little 1
dwarf 1
was 1
dancing 1
upon 1
one 1
leg 1
and 1
singing 1
merrily 1

when 1
the 1
queen 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
jumped 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
her 1
little 1
friend 1
came 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
her 1
throne 1
and 1
called 1
all 1
her 1
court 1
round 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
the 1
nurse 1
stood 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
with 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
up 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
began 1
to 1
chuckle 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
having 1
the 1
poor 1
child 1
to 1
take 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
hut 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1

witch 1
told 1

thatsome 1
witch 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
dashed 1
his 1
right 1
foot 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
so 1
deep 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
lay 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
to 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
then 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
off 1
while 1
the 1
nurse 1
laughed 1
and 1
the 1
baby 1
crowed 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
court 1
jeered 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
having 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
for 1
nothing 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
wish 1
you 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
morning 1
and 1
a 1
merry 1
feast 1
mr 1
rumplestiltskin 1
clever 1
gretel 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
cook 1
named 1
gretel 1
who 1
wore 1
shoes 1
with 1
red 1
heels 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
walked 1
out 1
with 1
them 1
on 1
she 1
turned 1
herself 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
quite 1
happy 1
and 1
thought 1
you 1
certainly 1
are 1
a 1
pretty 1
girl 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
home 1
she 1
drank 1
in 1
her 1
gladness 1
of 1
heart 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
wine 1
and 1
as 1
wine 1
excites 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
eat 1
she 1
tasted 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
whatever 1
she 1
was 1
cooking 1
until 1
she 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
cook 1
must 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
food 1
is 1
like 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
master 1
one 1
day 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
gretel 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
guest 1
coming 1
this 1
evening 1
prepare 1
me 1
two 1
fowls 1
very 1
daintily 1
i 1
will 1
see 1
to 1
it 1
master 1
answered 1
gretel 1
she 1
killed 1
two 1
fowls 1
scalded 1
them 1
plucked 1
them 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
spit 1
and 1
towards 1
evening 1
set 1
them 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
roast 1
the 1
fowls 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
brown 1
and 1
were 1
nearly 1
ready 1
but 1
the 1
guest 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
arrived 1
then 1
gretel 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
if 1
the 1
guest 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
i 1
must 1
take 1
the 1
fowls 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
sin 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
eaten 1
the 1
moment 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
their 1
juiciest 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
run 1
myself 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
guest 1
when 1
the 1
master 1
had 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
gretel 1
laid 1
the 1
spit 1
with 1
the 1
fowls 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
thought 1
standing 1
so 1
long 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
makes 1
one 1
sweat 1
and 1
thirsty 1
who 1
knows 1
when 1
they 1
will 1
come 1
meanwhile 1
i 1
will 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
drink 1
she 1
ran 1
down 1
set 1
a 1
jug 1
said 1
god 1
bless 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
gretel 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
drink 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
wine 1
should 1
flow 1
on 1
and 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
interrupted 1
and 1
took 1
yet 1
another 1
hearty 1
draught 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
fowls 1
down 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
basted 1
them 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
spit 1
merrily 1
round 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
smelt 1
so 1
good 1
gretel 1
thought 1
something 1
might 1
be 1
wrong 1
it 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
tasted 1
she 1
touched 1
it 1
with 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
said 1
ah 1
how 1
good 1
fowls 1
are 1
it 1
certainly 1
is 1
a 1
sin 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
eaten 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
master 1
was 1
not 1
coming 1
with 1
his 1
guest 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
fowls 1
and 1
thought 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
wings 1
is 1
burning 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
eat 1
it 1
so 1
she 1
cut 1
it 1
off 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
she 1
thought 1
the 1
other 1
must 1
go 1
down 1
too 1
or 1
else 1
master 1
will 1
observe 1
that 1
something 1
is 1
missing 1
when 1
the 1
two 1
wings 1
were 1
eaten 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
it 1
suddenly 1
occurred 1
to 1
her 1
who 1
knows 1
they 1
are 1
perhaps 1
not 1
coming 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
have 1
turned 1
in 1
somewhere 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
well 1
gretel 1
enjoy 1
yourself 1
one 1
fowl 1
has 1
been 1
cut 1
into 1
take 1
another 1
drink 1
and 1
eat 1
it 1
up 1
entirely 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
eaten 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
some 1
peace 1
why 1
should 1
gods 1
good 1
gifts 1
be 1
spoilt 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
again 1
took 1
an 1
enormous 1
drink 1
and 1
ate 1
up 1
the 1
one 1
chicken 1
in 1
great 1
glee 1
when 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chickens 1
was 1
swallowed 1
down 1
and 1
still 1
her 1
master 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
gretel 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
one 1
is 1
the 1
other 1
should 1
be 1
likewise 1
the 1
two 1
go 1
together 1
whats 1
right 1
for 1
the 1
one 1
is 1
right 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
think 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
take 1
another 1
draught 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
another 1
hearty 1
drink 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
second 1
chicken 1
follow 1
the 1
first 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
her 1
master 1
came 1
and 1
cried 1
hurry 1
up 1
gretel 1
the 1
guest 1
is 1
coming 1
directly 1
after 1
me 1
yes 1
sir 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
serve 1
up 1
answered 1
gretel 1
meantime 1
the 1
master 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
properly 1
laid 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
great 1
knife 1
wherewith 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carve 1
the 1
chickens 1
and 1
sharpened 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
presently 1
the 1
guest 1
came 1
and 1
knocked 1
politely 1
and 1
courteously 1
at 1
the 1
housedoor 1
gretel 1
ran 1
and 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
guest 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
finger 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
said 1
hush 1
hush 1
go 1
away 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
if 1
my 1
master 1
catches 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
you 1
he 1
certainly 1
did 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
supper 1
but 1
his 1
intention 1
is 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
your 1
two 1
ears 1
just 1
listen 1
how 1
he 1
is 1
sharpening 1
the 1
knife 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
guest 1
heard 1
the 1
sharpening 1
and 1
hurried 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
again 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
gretel 1
was 1
not 1
idle 1
she 1
ran 1
screaming 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
cried 1
you 1
have 1
invited 1
a 1
fine 1
guest 1
why 1
gretel 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
yes 1
said 1
she 1
he 1
has 1
taken 1
the 1
chickens 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
serve 1
up 1
off 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
has 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
thats 1
a 1
nice 1
trick 1
said 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
lamented 1
the 1
fine 1
chickens 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
left 1
me 1
one 1
so 1
that 1
something 1
remained 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
eat 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
but 1
the 1
guest 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
hear 1
then 1
he 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
knife 1
still 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
crying 1
just 1
one 1
just 1
one 1
meaning 1
that 1
the 1
guest 1
should 1
leave 1
him 1
just 1
one 1
chicken 1
and 1
not 1
take 1
both 1
the 1
guest 1
however 1
thought 1
no 1
otherwise 1
than 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
ran 1
as 1
if 1
fire 1
were 1
burning 1
under 1
him 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
both 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
grandson 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
very 1
old 1
man 1
whose 1
eyes 1
had 1
become 1
dim 1
his 1
ears 1
dull 1
of 1
hearing 1
his 1
knees 1
trembled 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
table 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
hold 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
spilt 1
the 1
broth 1
upon 1
the 1
tablecloth 1
or 1
let 1
it 1
run 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
his 1
sons 1
wife 1
were 1
disgusted 1
at 1
this 1
so 1
the 1
old 1
grandfather 1
at 1
last 1
had 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
behind 1
the 1
stove 1
and 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
food 1
in 1
an 1
earthenware 1
bowl 1
and 1
not 1
even 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
towards 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
full 1
of 1
tears 1
once 1
too 1
his 1
trembling 1
hands 1
could 1
not 1
hold 1
the 1
bowl 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
broke 1
the 1
young 1
wife 1
scolded 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
only 1
sighed 1
then 1
they 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
wooden 1
bowl 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
halfpence 1
out 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
eat 1
they 1
were 1
once 1
sitting 1
thus 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
grandson 1
of 1
four 1
years 1
old 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
together 1
some 1
bits 1
of 1
wood 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
asked 1
the 1
father 1
i 1
am 1
making 1
a 1
little 1
trough 1
answered 1
the 1
child 1
for 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
to 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
big 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
looked 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
then 1
they 1
took 1
the 1
old 1
grandfather 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
henceforth 1
always 1
let 1
him 1
eat 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
likewise 1
said 1
nothing 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
spill 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
anything 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
village 1
wherein 1
no 1
one 1
lived 1
but 1
really 1
rich 1
peasants 1
and 1
just 1
one 1
poor 1
one 1
whom 1
they 1
called 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
cow 1
and 1
still 1
less 1
money 1
to 1
buy 1
one 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
did 1
so 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
listen 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
there 1
is 1
our 1
gossip 1
the 1
carpenter 1
he 1
shall 1
make 1
us 1
a 1
wooden 1
calf 1
and 1
paint 1
it 1
brown 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
looks 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
and 1
in 1
time 1
it 1
will 1
certainly 1
get 1
big 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
cow 1
the 1
woman 1
also 1
liked 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
their 1
gossip 1
the 1
carpenter 1
cut 1
and 1
planed 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
painted 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
head 1
hanging 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
eating 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
cows 1
were 1
being 1
driven 1
out 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
called 1
the 1
cowherd 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
look 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
calf 1
there 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
small 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
the 1
cowherd 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
pasture 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
among 1
the 1
grass 1
the 1
little 1
calf 1
always 1
remained 1
standing 1
like 1
one 1
which 1
was 1
eating 1
and 1
the 1
cowherd 1
said 1
it 1
will 1
soon 1
run 1
by 1
itself 1
just 1
look 1
how 1
it 1
eats 1
already 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drive 1
the 1
herd 1
home 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
calf 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
stand 1
there 1
and 1
eat 1
your 1
fill 1
you 1
can 1
also 1
go 1
on 1
your 1
four 1
legs 1
i 1
dont 1
care 1
to 1
drag 1
you 1
home 1
again 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
stood 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
his 1
little 1
calf 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
cowherd 1
drove 1
the 1
cows 1
through 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
calf 1
was 1
missing 1
he 1
inquired 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
cowherd 1
answered 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
standing 1
out 1
there 1
eating 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
stop 1
and 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
said 1
oh 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
my 1
beast 1
back 1
again 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
together 1
but 1
someone 1
had 1
stolen 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
cowherd 1
said 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
run 1
away 1
the 1
peasant 1
however 1
said 1
dont 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
cowherd 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
who 1
for 1
his 1
carelessness 1
condemned 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
peasant 1
a 1
cow 1
for 1
the 1
calf 1
which 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
the 1
cow 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
wished 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
heartily 1
glad 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
food 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
could 1
give 1
it 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
so 1
it 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
they 1
salted 1
the 1
flesh 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
sell 1
the 1
skin 1
there 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
buy 1
a 1
new 1
calf 1
with 1
the 1
proceeds 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
mill 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
raven 1
with 1
broken 1
wings 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
pity 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
and 1
wrapped 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
skin 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
weather 1
grew 1
so 1
bad 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
storm 1
of 1
rain 1
and 1
wind 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
shelter 1
the 1
millers 1
wife 1
was 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
peasant 1
lay 1
yourself 1
on 1
the 1
straw 1
there 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
the 1
peasant 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
skin 1
beside 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
thought 1
he 1
is 1
tired 1
and 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
came 1
the 1
parson 1
the 1
millers 1
wife 1
received 1
him 1
well 1
and 1
said 1
my 1
husband 1
is 1
out 1
so 1
we 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
feast 1
the 1
peasant 1
listened 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
them 1
talk 1
about 1
feasting 1
he 1
was 1
vexed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
make 1
shift 1
with 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
then 1
the 1
woman 1
served 1
up 1
four 1
different 1
things 1
roast 1
meat 1
salad 1
cakes 1
and 1
wine 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
knocking 1
outside 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
oh 1
heavens 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
husband 1
she 1
quickly 1
hid 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
inside 1
the 1
tiled 1
stove 1
the 1
wine 1
under 1
the 1
pillow 1
the 1
salad 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
cakes 1
under 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
parson 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
on 1
the 1
porch 1
then 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
thank 1
heaven 1
you 1
are 1
back 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
storm 1
it 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
coming 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
the 1
miller 1
saw 1
the 1
peasant 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
fellow 1
doing 1
there 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
the 1
poor 1
knave 1
came 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
and 1
rain 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
shelter 1
so 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
where 1
the 1
straw 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
objection 1
but 1
be 1
quick 1
and 1
get 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
i 1
am 1
contented 1
with 1
anything 1
replied 1
the 1
husband 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
concerned 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
will 1
do 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
peasant 1
and 1
said 1
come 1
and 1
eat 1
some 1
more 1
with 1
me 1
the 1
peasant 1
did 1
not 1
require 1
to 1
be 1
invited 1
twice 1
but 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
ate 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
miller 1
saw 1
the 1
skin 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
raven 1
was 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
there 1
the 1
peasant 1
answered 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
soothsayer 1
inside 1
it 1
can 1
he 1
foretell 1
anything 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
why 1
not 1
answered 1
the 1
peasant 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
says 1
four 1
things 1
and 1
the 1
fifth 1
he 1
keeps 1
to 1
himself 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
curious 1
and 1
said 1
let 1
him 1
foretell 1
something 1
for 1
once 1
then 1
the 1
peasant 1
pinched 1
the 1
ravens 1
head 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
croaked 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
noise 1
like 1

the 1
miller 1
said 1
what 1
did 1

the 1
first 1
place 1

wine 1
hidden 1
under 1
the 1
pillow 1

the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
found 1

on 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
peasant 1
made 1
the 1
raven 1

again 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
roast 1
meat 1
in 1
the 1
tiled 1
stove 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
thither 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
the 1
peasant 1
made 1
the 1
raven 1
prophesy 1
still 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
thirdly 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
salad 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
salad 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
peasant 1
pinched 1
the 1
raven 1
once 1
more 1
till 1
he 1
croaked 1
and 1
said 1
fourthly 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
cakes 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
looked 1
there 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
cakes 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
two 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
together 1
but 1
the 1
millers 1
wife 1
was 1
frightened 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
took 1
all 1
the 1
keys 1
with 1
her 1
the 1
miller 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
much 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
fifth 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
said 1
first 1
we 1
will 1
quickly 1
eat 1
the 1
four 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
fifth 1
is 1
something 1
bad 1
so 1
they 1
ate 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
bargained 1
how 1
much 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
to 1
give 1
for 1
the 1
fifth 1
prophecy 1
until 1
they 1
agreed 1
on 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
then 1
the 1
peasant 1
once 1
more 1
pinched 1
the 1
ravens 1
head 1
till 1
he 1
croaked 1
loudly 1
the 1
miller 1
asked 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
the 1
peasant 1
replied 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
the 1
devil 1
is 1
hiding 1
outside 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
on 1
the 1
porch 1
the 1
miller 1
said 1
the 1
devil 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
housedoor 1
then 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
keys 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
unlocked 1
the 1
closet 1
the 1
parson 1
ran 1
out 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
true 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
black 1
rascal 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
the 1
peasant 1
however 1
made 1
off 1
next 1
morning 1
by 1
daybreak 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
at 1
home 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
gradually 1
launched 1
out 1
he 1
built 1
a 1
beautiful 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
peasants 1
said 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
has 1
certainly 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
golden 1
snow 1
falls 1
and 1
people 1
carry 1
the 1
gold 1
home 1
in 1
shovels 1
then 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
was 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
and 1
bidden 1
to 1
say 1
from 1
whence 1
his 1
wealth 1
came 1
he 1
answered 1
i 1
sold 1
my 1
cows 1
skin 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
when 1
the 1
peasants 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
too 1
wished 1
to 1
enjoy 1
this 1
great 1
profit 1
and 1
ran 1
home 1
killed 1
all 1
their 1
cows 1
and 1
stripped 1
off 1
their 1
skins 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
sell 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
advantage 1
the 1
mayor 1
however 1
said 1
but 1
my 1
servant 1
must 1
go 1
first 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
her 1
more 1
than 1
two 1
talers 1
for 1
a 1
skin 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
others 1
came 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
with 1
all 1
these 1
skins 1
then 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
vexed 1
that 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
should 1
have 1
thus 1
outwitted 1
them 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
vengeance 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
accused 1
him 1
of 1
this 1
treachery 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
the 1
innocent 1
little 1
peasant 1
was 1
unanimously 1
sentenced 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
rolled 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
a 1
barrel 1
pierced 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
forth 1
and 1
a 1
priest 1
was 1
brought 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
mass 1
for 1
his 1
soul 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
all 1
obliged 1
to 1
retire 1
to 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
peasant 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
priest 1
he 1
recognized 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
with 1
the 1
millers 1
wife 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
closet 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
barrel 1
at 1
this 1
same 1
moment 1
up 1
came 1
with 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
sheep 1
the 1
very 1
shepherd 1
whom 1
the 1
peasant 1
knew 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
wishing 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
so 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
no 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
insists 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
the 1
shepherd 1
hearing 1
that 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
about 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
the 1
peasant 1
said 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
mayor 1
if 1
i 1
will 1
but 1
put 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
barrel 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
the 1
shepherd 1
said 1
if 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
is 1
needful 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
i 1
would 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
barrel 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
peasant 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
in 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
mayor 1
the 1
shepherd 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
got 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
shut 1
the 1
top 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
shepherds 1
flock 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
drove 1
it 1
away 1
the 1
parson 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
declared 1
that 1
the 1
mass 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
and 1
rolled 1
the 1
barrel 1
towards 1
the 1
water 1
when 1
the 1
barrel 1
began 1
to 1
roll 1
the 1
shepherd 1
cried 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
they 1
believed 1
no 1
otherwise 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
peasant 1
who 1
was 1
saying 1
this 1
and 1
answered 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
intend 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
shall 1
look 1
about 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
down 1
below 1
there 1
and 1
they 1
rolled 1
the 1
barrel 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
peasants 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
entering 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
also 1
came 1
quietly 1
in 1
driving 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
sheep 1
and 1
looking 1
quite 1
contented 1
then 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
astonished 1
and 1
said 1
peasant 1
from 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
have 1
you 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
yes 1
truly 1
replied 1
the 1
peasant 1
i 1
sank 1
deep 1
deep 1
down 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
i 1
pushed 1
the 1
bottom 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
barrel 1
and 1
crept 1
out 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
pretty 1
meadows 1
on 1
which 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
lambs 1
were 1
feeding 1
and 1
from 1
thence 1
i 1
brought 1
this 1
flock 1
away 1
with 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
peasants 1
are 1
there 1
any 1
more 1
there 1
oh 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
could 1
want 1
then 1
the 1
peasants 1
made 1
up 1
their 1
minds 1
that 1
they 1
too 1
would 1
fetch 1
some 1
sheep 1
for 1
themselves 1
a 1
flock 1
apiece 1
but 1
the 1
mayor 1
said 1
i 1
come 1
first 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
together 1
and 1
just 1
then 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
fleecy 1
clouds 1
in 1
the 1
blue 1
sky 1
which 1
are 1
called 1
little 1
lambs 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
whereupon 1
the 1
peasants 1
cried 1
we 1
already 1
see 1
the 1
sheep 1
down 1
below 1
the 1
mayor 1
pressed 1
forward 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
down 1
first 1
and 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
things 1
promise 1
well 1
ill 1
call 1
you 1
so 1
he 1
jumped 1
in 1
splash 1
went 1
the 1
water 1
it 1
sounded 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
calling 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
plunged 1
in 1
after 1
him 1
as 1
one 1
man 1
then 1
the 1
entire 1
village 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
as 1
sole 1
heir 1
became 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
frederick 1
and 1
catherine 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
called 1
frederick 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wife 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
catherine 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
been 1
married 1
one 1
day 1
frederick 1
said 1
kate 1
i 1

fields 1

i 1
shall 1
be 1
hungry 1
so 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
something 1
nice 1
cooked 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
draught 1
of 1
ale 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
it 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
ready 1
when 1
dinnertime 1
drew 1
nigh 1
catherine 1
took 1
a 1
nice 1
steak 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
meat 1
she 1
had 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
fry 1
the 1
steak 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
brown 1
and 1
to 1
crackle 1
in 1
the 1
pan 1
and 1
catherine 1
stood 1
by 1
with 1
a 1
fork 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
the 1
steak 1
is 1
almost 1
ready 1
i 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
for 1
the 1
ale 1
so 1
she 1
left 1
the 1
pan 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
jug 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
tapped 1
the 1
ale 1
cask 1
the 1
beer 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
catherine 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
popped 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
the 1
dog 1
is 1
not 1
shut 1
uphe 1
may 1
be 1
running 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
steak 1
thats 1
well 1
thought 1
of 1
so 1
up 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
sure 1
enough 1
the 1
rascally 1
cur 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
steak 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
away 1
ran 1
catherine 1
and 1
away 1
ran 1
the 1
dog 1
across 1
the 1
field 1
but 1
he 1
ran 1
faster 1
than 1
she 1
and 1
stuck 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
steak 1
its 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
what 1
cant 1
be 1
cured 1
must 1
be 1
endured 1
said 1
catherine 1
so 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
a 1
good 1
way 1
and 1
was 1
tired 1
she 1
walked 1
home 1
leisurely 1
to 1
cool 1
herself 1
now 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
ale 1
was 1
running 1
too 1
for 1
catherine 1
had 1
not 1
turned 1
the 1
cock 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
jug 1
was 1
full 1
the 1
liquor 1
ran 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
till 1
the 1
cask 1
was 1
empty 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
stairs 1
she 1
saw 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
my 1
stars 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
to 1
keep 1
frederick 1
from 1
seeing 1
all 1
this 1
slopping 1
about 1
so 1
she 1
thought 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
remembered 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sack 1
of 1
fine 1
meal 1
bought 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
fair 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
sprinkled 1
this 1
over 1
the 1
floor 1
it 1
would 1
suck 1
up 1
the 1
ale 1
nicely 1
what 1
a 1
lucky 1
thing 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
we 1
kept 1
that 1
meal 1
we 1
have 1
now 1
a 1
good 1
use 1
for 1
it 1
so 1
away 1
she 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
managed 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
just 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
jug 1
full 1
of 1
beer 1
and 1
upset 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
all 1
the 1
ale 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
saved 1
was 1
set 1
swimming 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
also 1
ah 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
when 1
one 1
goes 1
another 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
follow 1
then 1
she 1
strewed 1
the 1
meal 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
pleased 1
with 1
her 1
cleverness 1
and 1
said 1
how 1
very 1
neat 1
and 1
clean 1
it 1
looks 1
at 1
noon 1
frederick 1
came 1
home 1
now 1
wife 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
for 1
dinner 1
o 1
frederick 1
answered 1
she 1
i 1
was 1
cooking 1
you 1
a 1
steak 1
but 1
while 1
i 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
ale 1
the 1
dog 1
ran 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
the 1
ale 1
ran 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
dry 1
up 1
the 1
ale 1
with 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
meal 1
that 1
we 1
got 1
at 1
the 1
fair 1
i 1
upset 1
the 1
jug 1
but 1
the 1
cellar 1
is 1
now 1
quite 1
dry 1
and 1
looks 1
so 1
clean 1
kate 1
kate 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
leave 1
the 1
steak 1
to 1
fry 1
and 1
the 1
ale 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
then 1
spoil 1
all 1
the 1
meal 1
why 1
frederick 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
wrong 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
before 1
the 1
husband 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
my 1
wife 1
manages 1
matters 1
thus 1
i 1
must 1
look 1
sharp 1
myself 1
now 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
catherine 1
what 1
pretty 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
these 1
are 1
i 1
shall 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
box 1
and 1
bury 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
you 1
never 1
go 1
near 1
or 1
meddle 1
with 1
them 1
no 1
frederick 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
will 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
some 1
pedlars 1
with 1
earthenware 1
plates 1
and 1
dishes 1
and 1
they 1
asked 1
her 1
whether 1
she 1
would 1
buy 1
oh 1
dear 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
buy 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
money 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
any 1
use 1
for 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
i 1
might 1
deal 1
with 1
you 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
said 1
they 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
dig 1
where 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
the 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
go 1
myself 1
so 1
the 1
rogues 1
went 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
what 1
these 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
were 1
they 1
took 1
them 1
all 1
away 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
plenty 1
of 1
plates 1
and 1
dishes 1
then 1
she 1
set 1
them 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
show 1
and 1
when 1
frederick 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
kate 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
doing 1
see 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
have 1
bought 1
all 1
these 1
with 1
your 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
touch 1
them 1
myself 1
the 1
pedlars 1
went 1
themselves 1
and 1
dug 1
them 1
up 1
wife 1
wife 1
said 1
frederick 1
what 1
a 1
pretty 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
those 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
were 1
all 1
my 1
money 1
how 1
came 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
why 1
answered 1
she 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
harm 1
in 1
it 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
catherine 1
stood 1
musing 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
hark 1
ye 1
frederick 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
get 1
the 1
gold 1
back 1
let 1
us 1
run 1
after 1
the 1
thieves 1
well 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
answered 1
he 1
but 1
take 1
some 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
frederick 1
walked 1
the 1
fastest 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
wife 1
some 1
way 1
behind 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
matter 1
thought 1
she 1
when 1
we 1
turn 1
back 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
so 1
much 1
nearer 1
home 1
than 1
he 1
presently 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
hill 1
down 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
which 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
road 1
so 1
narrow 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
wheels 1
always 1
chafed 1
the 1
trees 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
ah 1
see 1
now 1
said 1
she 1
how 1
they 1
have 1
bruised 1
and 1
wounded 1
those 1
poor 1
trees 1
they 1
will 1
never 1
get 1
well 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
made 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
butter 1
to 1
grease 1
them 1
all 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
might 1
not 1
hurt 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
this 1
kind 1
office 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
cheeses 1
fell 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
basket 1
and 1
rolled 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
catherine 1
looked 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
where 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
well 1
i 1
suppose 1
the 1
other 1
will 1
go 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
and 1
find 1
you 1
he 1
has 1
younger 1
legs 1
than 1
i 1
have 1
then 1
she 1
rolled 1
the 1
other 1
cheese 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
away 1
it 1
went 1
nobody 1
knows 1
where 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
supposed 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
would 1
follow 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
stay 1
there 1
all 1
day 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
overtook 1
frederick 1
who 1
desired 1
her 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
dry 1
bread 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
said 1
he 1
oh 1
answered 1
she 1
i 1
used 1
the 1
butter 1
to 1
grease 1
those 1
poor 1
trees 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
chafed 1
so 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cheeses 1
ran 1
away 1
so 1
i 1
sent 1
the 1
other 1
after 1
it 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
suppose 1
they 1
are 1
both 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
together 1
somewhere 1
what 1
a 1
goose 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
silly 1
things 1
said 1
the 1
husband 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
not 1
they 1
ate 1
the 1
dry 1
bread 1
together 1
and 1
frederick 1
said 1
kate 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
safe 1
when 1
you 1
came 1
away 1
no 1
answered 1
she 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
then 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
now 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
any 1
farther 1
said 1
frederick 1
and 1
bring 1
with 1
you 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
catherine 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
frederick 1
wants 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
i 1
dont 1
think 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
ill 1
bring 1
him 1
a 1
bag 1
of 1
fine 1
nuts 1
and 1
the 1
vinegar 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
seen 1
him 1
take 1
some 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
home 1
she 1
bolted 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
but 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
she 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
hinges 1
and 1
said 1
frederick 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
lock 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
surely 1
it 1
can 1
nowhere 1
be 1
so 1
safe 1
if 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
time 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
overtook 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
there 1
frederick 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
door 1
itself 1
you 1
may 1
watch 1
it 1
as 1
carefully 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
alas 1
alas 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
wife 1
i 1
have 1
i 1
sent 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
house 1
fast 1
and 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
door 1
away 1
so 1
that 1
everybody 1
may 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
as 1
they 1
pleasehowever 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
brought 1
the 1
door 1
you 1
shall 1
carry 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
pains 1
very 1
well 1
answered 1
she 1
ill 1
carry 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
ill 1
not 1
carry 1
the 1
nuts 1
and 1
vinegar 1
bottle 1
alsothat 1
would 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
load 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
ill 1
fasten 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
frederick 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
that 1
plan 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
the 1
thieves 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
they 1
climbed 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
there 1
scarcely 1
were 1
they 1
up 1
than 1
who 1
should 1
come 1
by 1
but 1
the 1
very 1
rogues 1
they 1
were 1
looking 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
truth 1
great 1
rascals 1
and 1
belonged 1
to 1
that 1
class 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
find 1
things 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
lost 1
they 1
were 1
tired 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
the 1
very 1
tree 1
where 1
frederick 1
and 1
catherine 1
were 1
frederick 1
slipped 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
some 1
stones 1
then 1
he 1
climbed 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
hit 1
the 1
thieves 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
said 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
near 1
morning 1
for 1
the 1
wind 1
shakes 1
the 1
firapples 1
down 1
catherine 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
her 1
shoulder 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
tired 1
but 1
she 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
nuts 1
upon 1
it 1
that 1
were 1
so 1
heavy 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
softly 1
frederick 1
i 1

let 1
the 1
nuts 1
go 1
no 1
answered 1
he 1
not 1
now 1
they 1
will 1
discover 1
us 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
well 1
then 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
throw 1
them 1
down 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
away 1
rattled 1
the 1
nuts 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
boughs 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
thieves 1
cried 1
bless 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
hailing 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
after 1
catherine 1
thought 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
still 1
very 1
heavy 1
so 1
she 1
whispered 1
to 1
frederick 1
i 1
must 1
throw 1
the 1
vinegar 1
down 1
pray 1
dont 1
answered 1
he 1
it 1
will 1
discover 1
us 1
i 1
cant 1
help 1
that 1
said 1
she 1
go 1
it 1
must 1
so 1
she 1
poured 1
all 1
the 1
vinegar 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
thieves 1
said 1
what 1
a 1
heavy 1
dew 1
there 1
is 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
popped 1
into 1
catherines 1
head 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
door 1
itself 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
heavy 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
she 1
whispered 1
frederick 1
i 1
must 1
throw 1
the 1
door 1
down 1
soon 1
but 1
he 1
begged 1
and 1
prayed 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
it 1
would 1
betray 1
them 1
here 1
goes 1
however 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
down 1
went 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
clatter 1
upon 1
the 1
thieves 1
that 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
murder 1
and 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
was 1
coming 1
ran 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
and 1
left 1
all 1
the 1
gold 1
so 1
when 1
frederick 1
and 1
catherine 1
came 1
down 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
all 1
their 1
money 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
witch 1
and 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
one 1
ugly 1
and 1
wicked 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
she 1
loved 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
and 1
one 1
beautiful 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
she 1
hated 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
the 1
stepdaughter 1
once 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
apron 1
which 1
the 1
other 1
fancied 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
she 1
became 1
envious 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
that 1
apron 1
be 1
quiet 1
my 1
child 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
your 1
stepsister 1
has 1
long 1
deserved 1
death 1
tonight 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
asleep 1
i 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
head 1
off 1
only 1
be 1
careful 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
push 1
her 1
well 1
to 1
the 1
front 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
just 1
then 1
been 1
standing 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
heard 1
everything 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
she 1
dared 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
and 1
when 1
bedtime 1
had 1
come 1
the 1
witchs 1
daughter 1
got 1
into 1
bed 1
first 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
lie 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
the 1
other 1
pushed 1
her 1
gently 1
to 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
took 1
for 1
herself 1
the 1
place 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
creeping 1
in 1
she 1
held 1
an 1
axe 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
felt 1
with 1
her 1
left 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anyone 1
were 1
lying 1
at 1
the 1
outside 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
grasped 1
the 1
axe 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
own 1
childs 1
head 1
off 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
the 1
girl 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
roland 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
listen 1
dearest 1
roland 1
we 1
must 1
fly 1
in 1
all 1
haste 1
my 1
stepmother 1
wanted 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
but 1
has 1
struck 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
when 1
daylight 1
comes 1
and 1
she 1
sees 1
what 1
she 1
has 1
done 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
lost 1
but 1
said 1
roland 1
i 1
counsel 1
you 1
first 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
her 1
magic 1
wand 1
or 1
we 1
cannot 1
escape 1
if 1
she 1
pursues 1
us 1
the 1
maiden 1
fetched 1
the 1
magic 1
wand 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
dead 1
girls 1
head 1
and 1
dropped 1
three 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
one 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
then 1
she 1
hurried 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
lover 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
got 1
up 1
next 1
morning 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
daughter 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
the 1
apron 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
then 1
the 1
witch 1
cried 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
i 1
am 1
sweeping 1
answered 1
the 1
first 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
went 1
out 1
but 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
cried 1
again 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
i 1
am 1
warming 1
myself 1
cried 1
the 1
second 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
then 1
she 1
cried 1
again 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
ah 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
i 1
am 1
sleeping 1
cried 1
the 1
third 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
see 1
there 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
whose 1
head 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
off 1
bathed 1
in 1
her 1
blood 1
the 1
witch 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
look 1
forth 1
quite 1
far 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
perceived 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
hurrying 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
that 1
shall 1
not 1
help 1
you 1
cried 1
she 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
you 1
shall 1
still 1
not 1
escape 1
me 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
manyleague 1
boots 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
covered 1
an 1
hours 1
walk 1
at 1
every 1
step 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
overtook 1
them 1
the 1
girl 1
however 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
striding 1
towards 1
her 1
changed 1
with 1
her 1
magic 1
wand 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
into 1
a 1
lake 1
and 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
duck 1
swimming 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
witch 1
placed 1
herself 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
threw 1
breadcrumbs 1
in 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
endless 1
trouble 1
to 1
entice 1
the 1
duck 1
but 1
the 1
duck 1
did 1
not 1
let 1
herself 1
be 1
enticed 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
at 1
night 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
at 1
this 1
the 1
girl 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
resumed 1
their 1
natural 1
shapes 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
until 1
daybreak 1
then 1
the 1
maiden 1
changed 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
which 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
briar 1
hedge 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
into 1
a 1
fiddler 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
witch 1
came 1
striding 1
up 1
towards 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
musician 1
dear 1
musician 1
may 1
i 1
pluck 1
that 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
for 1
myself 1
oh 1
yes 1
he 1
replied 1
i 1
will 1
play 1
to 1
you 1
while 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
hastily 1
creeping 1
into 1
the 1
hedge 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
pluck 1
the 1
flower 1
knowing 1
perfectly 1
well 1
who 1
the 1
flower 1
was 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
whether 1
she 1
would 1
or 1
not 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
dance 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
magical 1
dance 1
the 1
faster 1
he 1
played 1
the 1
more 1
violent 1
springs 1
was 1
she 1
forced 1
to 1
make 1
and 1
the 1
thorns 1
tore 1
her 1
clothes 1
from 1
her 1
body 1
and 1
pricked 1
her 1
and 1
wounded 1
her 1
till 1
she 1
bled 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
dance 1
till 1
she 1
lay 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
set 1
free 1
roland 1
said 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
arrange 1
for 1
the 1
wedding 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
will 1
stay 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
girl 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
may 1
recognize 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
change 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
red 1
stone 1
landmark 1
then 1
roland 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
stood 1
like 1
a 1
red 1
landmark 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
her 1
beloved 1
but 1
when 1
roland 1
got 1
home 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
snares 1
of 1
another 1
who 1
so 1
fascinated 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
the 1
maiden 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
at 1
all 1
she 1
was 1
sad 1
and 1
changed 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
flower 1
and 1
thought 1
someone 1
will 1
surely 1
come 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
trample 1
me 1
down 1
it 1
befell 1
however 1
that 1
a 1
shepherd 1
kept 1
his 1
sheep 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
pretty 1
plucked 1
it 1
took 1
it 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
away 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
forth 1
strange 1
things 1
happened 1
in 1
the 1
shepherds 1
house 1
when 1
he 1
arose 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
already 1
done 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
swept 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
benches 1
cleaned 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
hearth 1
was 1
lighted 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
fetched 1
and 1
at 1
noon 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
laid 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
dinner 1
served 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
conceive 1
how 1
this 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
for 1
he 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
have 1
concealed 1
himself 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
certainly 1
pleased 1
with 1
this 1
good 1
attendance 1
but 1
still 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
afraid 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
wise 1
woman 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
her 1
advice 1
the 1
wise 1
woman 1
said 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
enchantment 1
behind 1
it 1
listen 1
very 1
early 1
some 1
morning 1
if 1
anything 1
is 1
moving 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
see 1
anything 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
throw 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
magic 1
will 1
be 1
stopped 1
the 1
shepherd 1
did 1
as 1
she 1
bade 1
him 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
just 1
as 1
day 1
dawned 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
chest 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
flower 1
come 1
out 1
swiftly 1
he 1
sprang 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
over 1
it 1
instantly 1
the 1
transformation 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
a 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
who 1
admitted 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
that 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
attended 1
to 1
his 1
housekeeping 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
her 1
story 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
pleased 1
him 1
he 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
marry 1
him 1
but 1
she 1
answered 1
no 1
for 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
remain 1
faithful 1
to 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
deserted 1
her 1
nevertheless 1
she 1
promised 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
but 1
to 1
continue 1
keeping 1
house 1
for 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
time 1
drew 1
near 1
when 1
rolands 1
wedding 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
celebrated 1
and 1
then 1
according 1
to 1
an 1
old 1
custom 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
it 1
was 1
announced 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
girls 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
sing 1
in 1
honour 1
of 1
the 1
bridal 1
pair 1
when 1
the 1
faithful 1
maiden 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
grew 1
so 1
sad 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
her 1
heart 1
would 1
break 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
thither 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
girls 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
turn 1
to 1
sing 1
she 1
stepped 1
back 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
left 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
began 1
her 1
song 1
and 1
it 1
reached 1
rolands 1
ears 1
he 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
voice 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
no 1
other 1
everything 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
and 1
which 1
had 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
mind 1
had 1
suddenly 1
come 1
home 1
again 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
then 1
the 1
faithful 1
maiden 1
held 1
her 1
wedding 1
with 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
roland 1
and 1
grief 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
joy 1
began 1
snowdrop 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
winter 1
when 1
the 1
broad 1
flakes 1
of 1
snow 1
were 1
falling 1
around 1
that 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
many 1
thousand 1
miles 1
off 1
sat 1
working 1
at 1
her 1
window 1
the 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
fine 1
black 1
ebony 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
sat 1
looking 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
snow 1
she 1
pricked 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
three 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
fell 1
upon 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
gazed 1
thoughtfully 1
upon 1
the 1
red 1
drops 1
that 1
sprinkled 1
the 1
white 1
snow 1
and 1
said 1
would 1
that 1
my 1
little 1
daughter 1
may 1
be 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
that 1
snow 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
that 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
this 1
ebony 1
windowframe 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
really 1
did 1
grow 1
up 1
her 1
skin 1
was 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
her 1
cheeks 1
as 1
rosy 1
as 1
the 1
blood 1
and 1
her 1
hair 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
ebony 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
called 1
snowdrop 1
but 1
this 1
queen 1
died 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
soon 1
married 1
another 1
wife 1
who 1
became 1
queen 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
but 1
so 1
vain 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
anyone 1
could 1
be 1
handsomer 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
fairy 1
lookingglass 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
gaze 1
upon 1
herself 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
say 1
tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
and 1
the 1
glass 1
had 1
always 1
answered 1
thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
beautiful 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
seven 1
years 1
old 1
she 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
fairer 1
than 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
then 1
the 1
glass 1
one 1
day 1
answered 1
the 1
queen 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
it 1
as 1
usual 1
thou 1
queen 1
art 1
fair 1
and 1
beauteous 1
to 1
see 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
than 1
thee 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
turned 1
pale 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
envy 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
servants 1
and 1
said 1
take 1
snowdrop 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
wood 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
the 1
servant 1
led 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
melted 1
when 1
snowdrop 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
hurt 1
you 1
thou 1
pretty 1
child 1
so 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
by 1
herself 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
most 1
likely 1
that 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
would 1
tear 1
her 1
in 1
pieces 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
great 1
weight 1
were 1
taken 1
off 1
his 1
heart 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
not 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
but 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
to 1
her 1
fate 1
with 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
someone 1
finding 1
and 1
saving 1
her 1
then 1
poor 1
snowdrop 1
wandered 1
along 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
in 1
great 1
fear 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
roared 1
about 1
her 1
but 1
none 1
did 1
her 1
any 1
harm 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
cottage 1
among 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
her 1
little 1
feet 1
would 1
carry 1
her 1
no 1
further 1
everything 1
was 1
spruce 1
and 1
neat 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
spread 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
seven 1
little 1
plates 1
seven 1
little 1
loaves 1
and 1
seven 1
little 1
glasses 1
with 1
wine 1
in 1
them 1
and 1
seven 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
laid 1
in 1
order 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
stood 1
seven 1
little 1
beds 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
hungry 1
she 1
picked 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
each 1
loaf 1
and 1
drank 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
wine 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
glass 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
would 1
lie 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
so 1
she 1
tried 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
beds 1
but 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
long 1
and 1
another 1
was 1
too 1
short 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
seventh 1
suited 1
her 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
laid 1
herself 1
down 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
in 1
came 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
now 1
they 1
were 1
seven 1
little 1
dwarfs 1
that 1
lived 1
among 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
dug 1
and 1
searched 1
for 1
gold 1
they 1
lighted 1
up 1
their 1
seven 1
lamps 1
and 1
saw 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
right 1
the 1
first 1
said 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
sitting 1
on 1
my 1
stool 1
the 1
second 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
eating 1
off 1
my 1
plate 1
the 1
third 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
picking 1
my 1
bread 1
the 1
fourth 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
meddling 1
with 1
my 1
spoon 1
the 1
fifth 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
handling 1
my 1
fork 1
the 1
sixth 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
cutting 1
with 1
my 1
knife 1
the 1
seventh 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
my 1
wine 1
then 1
the 1
first 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
said 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
bed 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
everyone 1
cried 1
out 1
that 1
somebody 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
his 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
seventh 1
saw 1
snowdrop 1
and 1
called 1
all 1
his 1
brethren 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
astonishment 1
and 1
brought 1
their 1
lamps 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
heavens 1
what 1
a 1
lovely 1
child 1
she 1
is 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
wake 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
seventh 1
dwarf 1
slept 1
an 1
hour 1
with 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
dwarfs 1
in 1
turn 1
till 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
gone 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
snowdrop 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
her 1
story 1
and 1
they 1
pitied 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
keep 1
all 1
things 1
in 1
order 1
and 1
cook 1
and 1
wash 1
and 1
knit 1
and 1
spin 1
for 1
them 1
she 1
might 1
stay 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
seeking 1
for 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
in 1
the 1
mountains 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
was 1
left 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
they 1
warned 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
queen 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
take 1
care 1
and 1
let 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
but 1
the 1
queen 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
snowdrop 1
was 1
dead 1
believed 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
handsomest 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
and 1
the 1
glass 1
answered 1
thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
land 1
but 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
where 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
their 1
dwelling 1
have 1
made 1
there 1
snowdrop 1
is 1
hiding 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
o 1
queen 1
than 1
thee 1
then 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
frightened 1
for 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
glass 1
always 1
spoke 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
servant 1
had 1
betrayed 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
anyone 1
lived 1
who 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
as 1
an 1
old 1
pedlar 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
dwelt 1
then 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
cried 1
fine 1
wares 1
to 1
sell 1
snowdrop 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
day 1
good 1
woman 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
to 1
sell 1
good 1
wares 1
fine 1
wares 1
said 1
she 1
laces 1
and 1
bobbins 1
of 1
all 1
colours 1
i 1
will 1
let 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
in 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
sort 1
of 1
body 1
thought 1
snowdrop 1
as 1
she 1
ran 1
down 1
and 1
unbolted 1
the 1
door 1
bless 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
how 1
badly 1
your 1
stays 1
are 1
laced 1
let 1
me 1
lace 1
them 1
up 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
nice 1
new 1
laces 1
snowdrop 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
any 1
mischief 1
so 1
she 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
but 1
she 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
so 1
nimbly 1
and 1
pulled 1
the 1
lace 1
so 1
tight 1
that 1
snowdrops 1
breath 1
was 1
stopped 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
dead 1
theres 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
all 1
thy 1
beauty 1
said 1
the 1
spiteful 1
queen 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
how 1
grieved 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
faithful 1
snowdrop 1
stretched 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
dead 1
however 1
they 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
what 1
ailed 1
her 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
lace 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
breathe 1
and 1
very 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
then 1
they 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
take 1
care 1
another 1
time 1
and 1
let 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
away 1
when 1
the 1
queen 1
got 1
home 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
spoke 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
to 1
her 1
great 1
grief 1
it 1
still 1
said 1
thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
land 1
but 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
where 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
their 1
dwelling 1
have 1
made 1
there 1
snowdrop 1
is 1
hiding 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
o 1
queen 1
than 1
thee 1
then 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
cold 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
with 1
spite 1
and 1
malice 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
snowdrop 1
still 1
lived 1
and 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
again 1
but 1
in 1
quite 1
another 1
dress 1
from 1
the 1
one 1
she 1
wore 1
before 1
and 1
took 1
with 1
her 1
a 1
poisoned 1
comb 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
cottage 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
cried 1
fine 1
wares 1
to 1
sell 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
said 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
let 1
anyone 1
in 1
then 1
the 1
queen 1
said 1
only 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
beautiful 1
combs 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
the 1
poisoned 1
one 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
so 1
pretty 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
hair 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
it 1
touched 1
her 1
head 1
the 1
poison 1
was 1
so 1
powerful 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
senseless 1
there 1
you 1
may 1
lie 1
said 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
but 1
by 1
good 1
luck 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
came 1
in 1
very 1
early 1
that 1
evening 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
snowdrop 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
they 1
thought 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
soon 1
found 1
the 1
poisoned 1
comb 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
she 1
got 1
well 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
they 1
warned 1
her 1
once 1
more 1
not 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
anyone 1
meantime 1
the 1
queen 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
shook 1
with 1
rage 1
when 1
she 1
read 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
answer 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
snowdrop 1
shall 1
die 1
if 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
my 1
life 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
by 1
herself 1
into 1
her 1
chamber 1
and 1
got 1
ready 1
a 1
poisoned 1
apple 1
the 1
outside 1
looked 1
very 1
rosy 1
and 1
tempting 1
but 1
whoever 1
tasted 1
it 1
was 1
sure 1
to 1
die 1
then 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
as 1
a 1
peasants 1
wife 1
and 1
travelled 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
cottage 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
put 1
her 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
let 1
anyone 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
not 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
but 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
take 1
this 1
pretty 1
apple 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
no 1
said 1
snowdrop 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
you 1
silly 1
girl 1
answered 1
the 1
other 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
afraid 1
of 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
poisoned 1
come 1
do 1
you 1
eat 1
one 1
part 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
the 1
other 1
now 1
the 1
apple 1
was 1
so 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
one 1
side 1
was 1
good 1
though 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
was 1
poisoned 1
then 1
snowdrop 1
was 1
much 1
tempted 1
to 1
taste 1
for 1
the 1
apple 1
looked 1
so 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
eat 1
she 1
could 1
wait 1
no 1
longer 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
scarcely 1
put 1
the 1
piece 1
into 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
this 1
time 1
nothing 1
will 1
save 1
thee 1
said 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
said 1
thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
fair 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
wicked 1
heart 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
such 1
a 1
heart 1
could 1
be 1
when 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
had 1
gone 1
home 1
they 1
found 1
snowdrop 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
no 1
breath 1
came 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
dead 1
they 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
combed 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
washed 1
her 1
face 1
with 1
wine 1
and 1
water 1
but 1
all 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
seemed 1
quite 1
dead 1
so 1
they 1
laid 1
her 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
bier 1
and 1
all 1
seven 1
watched 1
and 1
bewailed 1
her 1
three 1
whole 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
thought 1
they 1
would 1
bury 1
her 1
but 1
her 1
cheeks 1
were 1
still 1
rosy 1
and 1
her 1
face 1
looked 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
alive 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
never 1
bury 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
ground 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
coffin 1
of 1
glass 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
still 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
wrote 1
upon 1
it 1
in 1
golden 1
letters 1
what 1
her 1
name 1
was 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
kings 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
coffin 1
was 1
set 1
among 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
always 1
sat 1
by 1
it 1
and 1
watched 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
came 1
too 1
and 1
bemoaned 1
snowdrop 1
and 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
came 1
an 1
owl 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
a 1
dove 1
and 1
sat 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
thus 1
snowdrop 1
lay 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
still 1
only 1
looked 1
as 1
though 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
even 1
now 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
ebony 1
at 1
last 1
a 1
prince 1
came 1
and 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
house 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
snowdrop 1
and 1
read 1
what 1
was 1
written 1
in 1
golden 1
letters 1
then 1
he 1
offered 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
money 1
and 1
prayed 1
and 1
besought 1
them 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
take 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
part 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
they 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
coffin 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
apple 1
fell 1
from 1
between 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
snowdrop 1
awoke 1
and 1
said 1
where 1
am 1
i 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
thou 1
art 1
quite 1
safe 1
with 1
me 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
far 1
better 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
so 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
fathers 1
palace 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
snowdrop 1
consented 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
with 1
great 1
pomp 1
and 1
splendour 1
for 1
their 1
wedding 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
asked 1
among 1
the 1
rest 1
snowdrops 1
old 1
enemy 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dressing 1
herself 1
in 1
fine 1
rich 1
clothes 1
she 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
and 1
the 1
glass 1
answered 1
thou 1
lady 1
art 1
loveliest 1
here 1
i 1
ween 1
but 1
lovelier 1
far 1
is 1
the 1
newmade 1
queen 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
started 1
with 1
rage 1
but 1
her 1
envy 1
and 1
curiosity 1
were 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
setting 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
there 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
than 1
snowdrop 1
who 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
had 1
been 1
dead 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
she 1
choked 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
died 1
but 1
snowdrop 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
lived 1
and 1
reigned 1
happily 1
over 1
that 1
land 1
many 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
sometimes 1
they 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
dwarfs 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
to 1
snowdrop 1
in 1
her 1
time 1
of 1
need 1
the 1
pink 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
queen 1
to 1
whom 1
god 1
had 1
given 1
no 1
children 1
every 1
morning 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
prayed 1
to 1
god 1
in 1
heaven 1
to 1
bestow 1
on 1
her 1
a 1
son 1
or 1
a 1
daughter 1
then 1
an 1
angel 1
from 1
heaven 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
be 1
at 1
rest 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
son 1
with 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
so 1
that 1
whatsoever 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
wishes 1
for 1
that 1
shall 1
he 1
have 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
joyful 1
tidings 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
come 1
she 1
gave 1
birth 1
to 1
a 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
gladness 1
every 1
morning 1
she 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
where 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
were 1
kept 1
and 1
washed 1
herself 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
stream 1
it 1
happened 1
once 1
when 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
older 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
asleep 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
and 1
stole 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hen 1
and 1
cut 1
it 1
in 1
pieces 1
and 1
dropped 1
some 1
of 1
its 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
queens 1
apron 1
and 1
on 1
her 1
dress 1
then 1
he 1
carried 1
the 1
child 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
secret 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
nurse 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
suckle 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
accused 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
having 1
allowed 1
her 1
child 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
from 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
the 1
blood 1
on 1
her 1
apron 1
he 1
believed 1
this 1
fell 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
passion 1
that 1
he 1
ordered 1
a 1
high 1
tower 1
to 1
be 1
built 1
in 1
which 1
neither 1
sun 1
nor 1
moon 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
had 1
his 1
wife 1
put 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
walled 1
up 1
here 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
stay 1
for 1
seven 1
years 1
without 1
meat 1
or 1
drink 1
and 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
but 1
god 1
sent 1
two 1
angels 1
from 1
heaven 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
white 1
doves 1
which 1
flew 1
to 1
her 1
twice 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
food 1
until 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
were 1
over 1
the 1
cook 1
however 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
if 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
here 1
he 1
might 1
very 1
easily 1
get 1
me 1
into 1
trouble 1
so 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
already 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
wish 1
for 1
a 1
beautiful 1
palace 1
for 1
yourself 1
with 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
all 1
else 1
that 1
pertains 1
to 1
it 1
scarcely 1
were 1
the 1
words 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
mouth 1
when 1
everything 1
was 1
there 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wished 1
for 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
alone 1
wish 1
for 1
a 1
pretty 1
girl 1
as 1
a 1
companion 1
then 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
wished 1
for 1
one 1
and 1
she 1
immediately 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
any 1
painter 1
could 1
have 1
painted 1
her 1
the 1
two 1
played 1
together 1
and 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
hearts 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
went 1
out 1
hunting 1
like 1
a 1
nobleman 1
the 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
might 1
some 1
day 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
thus 1
bring 1
him 1
into 1
great 1
peril 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
maiden 1
aside 1
and 1
said 1
tonight 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
is 1
asleep 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
plunge 1
this 1
knife 1
into 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
bring 1
me 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
shall 1
lose 1
your 1
life 1
thereupon 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
next 1
day 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
shed 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
an 1
innocent 1
boy 1
who 1
has 1
never 1
harmed 1
anyone 1
the 1
cook 1
once 1
more 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
it 1
shall 1
cost 1
you 1
your 1
own 1
life 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
hind 1
brought 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
and 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
a 1
plate 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
coming 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
lie 1
down 1
in 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
draw 1
the 1
clothes 1
over 1
you 1
then 1
the 1
wicked 1
wretch 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
boys 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
the 1
girl 1
reached 1
the 1
plate 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
threw 1
off 1
the 1
quilt 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
old 1
sinner 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
now 1
will 1
i 1
pronounce 1
thy 1
sentence 1
you 1
shall 1
become 1
a 1
black 1
poodle 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
gold 1
collar 1
round 1
your 1
neck 1
and 1
shall 1
eat 1
burning 1
coals 1
till 1
the 1
flames 1
burst 1
forth 1
from 1
your 1
throat 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
these 1
words 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
poodle 1
dog 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
gold 1
collar 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
cooks 1
were 1
ordered 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
some 1
live 1
coals 1
and 1
these 1
he 1
ate 1
until 1
the 1
flames 1
broke 1
forth 1
from 1
his 1
throat 1
the 1
kings 1
son 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
short 1
while 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
maiden 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
country 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
provide 1
for 1
you 1
ah 1
she 1
replied 1
the 1
way 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
land 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
unknown 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
quite 1
willing 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
wished 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
beautiful 1
pink 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
country 1
and 1
the 1
poodle 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
him 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
in 1
which 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
confined 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
high 1
he 1
wished 1
for 1
a 1
ladder 1
which 1
would 1
reach 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
top 1
then 1
he 1
mounted 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
inside 1
and 1
cried 1
beloved 1
mother 1
lady 1
queen 1
are 1
you 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
are 1
you 1
dead 1
she 1
answered 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
eaten 1
and 1
am 1
still 1
satisfied 1
for 1
she 1
thought 1
the 1
angels 1
were 1
there 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
dear 1
son 1
whom 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
were 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
torn 1
from 1
your 1
arms 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
alive 1
still 1
and 1
will 1
soon 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
then 1
he 1
descended 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
caused 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
announced 1
as 1
a 1
strange 1
huntsman 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
offer 1
him 1
service 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
yes 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
skilful 1
and 1
could 1
get 1
game 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
that 1
deer 1
had 1
never 1
taken 1
up 1
their 1
quarters 1
in 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
district 1
or 1
country 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
promised 1
to 1
procure 1
as 1
much 1
game 1
for 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
use 1
at 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
so 1
he 1
summoned 1
all 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
together 1
and 1
bade 1
them 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
form 1
a 1
great 1
circle 1
open 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
where 1
he 1
stationed 1
himself 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
wish 1
two 1
hundred 1
deer 1
and 1
more 1
came 1
running 1
inside 1
the 1
circle 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
shot 1
them 1
then 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
placed 1
on 1
sixty 1
country 1
carts 1
and 1
driven 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
for 1
once 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
deck 1
his 1
table 1
with 1
game 1
after 1
having 1
had 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
for 1
years 1
now 1
the 1
king 1
felt 1
great 1
joy 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
commanded 1
that 1
his 1
entire 1
household 1
should 1
eat 1
with 1
him 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
assembled 1
together 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
huntsman 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
clever 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
he 1
replied 1
lord 1
king 1
your 1
majesty 1
must 1
excuse 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
huntsman 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
insisted 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
until 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
there 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
dearest 1
mother 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
kings 1
principal 1
servants 1
would 1
begin 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
would 1
ask 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
faring 1
with 1
the 1
queen 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
alive 1
still 1
or 1
had 1
perished 1
hardly 1
had 1
he 1
formed 1
the 1
wish 1
than 1
the 1
marshal 1
began 1
and 1
said 1
your 1
majesty 1
we 1
live 1
joyously 1
here 1
but 1
how 1
is 1
the 1
queen 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
is 1
she 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
has 1
she 1
died 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
replied 1
she 1
let 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
be 1
torn 1
to 1
pieces 1
by 1
wild 1
beasts 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
her 1
named 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
arose 1
and 1
said 1
gracious 1
lord 1
father 1
she 1
is 1
alive 1
still 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
her 1
son 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
wild 1
beasts 1
but 1
by 1
that 1
wretch 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
tore 1
me 1
from 1
her 1
arms 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
her 1
apron 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
a 1
chicken 1
thereupon 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
dog 1
with 1
the 1
golden 1
collar 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
wretch 1
and 1
caused 1
live 1
coals 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
and 1
these 1
the 1
dog 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
devour 1
before 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
all 1
until 1
flames 1
burst 1
forth 1
from 1
its 1
throat 1
on 1
this 1
the 1
huntsman 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
dog 1
in 1
his 1
true 1
shape 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
cook 1
in 1
the 1
which 1
he 1
stood 1
immediately 1
with 1
his 1
white 1
apron 1
and 1
his 1
knife 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
and 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
cast 1
into 1
the 1
deepest 1
dungeon 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
spoke 1
further 1
and 1
said 1
father 1
will 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
maiden 1
who 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
so 1
tenderly 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
afterwards 1
to 1
murder 1
me 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
though 1
her 1
own 1
life 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
the 1
king 1
replied 1
yes 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
the 1
son 1
said 1
most 1
gracious 1
father 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
her 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
and 1
he 1
thrust 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
brought 1
forth 1
the 1
pink 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
one 1
to 1
equal 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
son 1
said 1
now 1
will 1
i 1
show 1
her 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
form 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
a 1
maiden 1
and 1
she 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
no 1
painter 1
could 1
have 1
made 1
her 1
look 1
more 1
so 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
two 1
waitingmaids 1
and 1
two 1
attendants 1
into 1
the 1
tower 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
in 1
she 1
ate 1
nothing 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
gracious 1
and 1
merciful 1
god 1
who 1
has 1
supported 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
will 1
soon 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
she 1
lived 1
three 1
days 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
died 1
happily 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
buried 1
the 1
two 1
white 1
doves 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
food 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
were 1
angels 1
of 1
heaven 1
followed 1
her 1
body 1
and 1
seated 1
themselves 1
on 1
her 1
grave 1
the 1
aged 1
king 1
ordered 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
be 1
torn 1
in 1
four 1
pieces 1
but 1
grief 1
consumed 1
the 1
kings 1
own 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
died 1
his 1
son 1
married 1
the 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
flower 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
whether 1
they 1
are 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
not 1
is 1
known 1
to 1
god 1
clever 1
elsie 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
clever 1
elsie 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
grown 1
up 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
we 1
will 1
get 1
her 1
married 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
if 1
only 1
someone 1
would 1
come 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
at 1
length 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
wooed 1
her 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
hans 1
but 1
he 1
stipulated 1
that 1
clever 1
elsie 1
should 1
be 1
really 1
smart 1
oh 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
she 1
has 1
plenty 1
of 1
good 1
sense 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
oh 1
she 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
wind 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
hear 1
the 1
flies 1
coughing 1
well 1
said 1
hans 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
really 1
smart 1
i 1
wont 1
have 1
her 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
at 1
dinner 1
and 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
elsie 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
fetch 1
some 1
beer 1
then 1
clever 1
elsie 1
took 1
the 1
pitcher 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
tapped 1
the 1
lid 1
briskly 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
might 1
not 1
appear 1
long 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
below 1
she 1
fetched 1
herself 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
barrel 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
stoop 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
hurt 1
her 1
back 1
or 1
do 1
herself 1
any 1
unexpected 1
injury 1
then 1
she 1
placed 1
the 1
can 1
before 1
her 1
and 1
turned 1
the 1
tap 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
beer 1
was 1
running 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
her 1
eyes 1
be 1
idle 1
but 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
peering 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
saw 1
a 1
pickaxe 1
exactly 1
above 1
her 1
which 1
the 1
masons 1
had 1
accidentally 1
left 1
there 1
then 1
clever 1
elsie 1
began 1
to 1
weep 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
i 1

hans 1
and 1

big 1
and 1
we 1
send 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
here 1
to 1

beer 1
then 1
the 1
pickaxe 1
will 1
fall 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
then 1
she 1
sat 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
screamed 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
her 1
body 1
over 1
the 1
misfortune 1
which 1
lay 1
before 1
her 1
those 1
upstairs 1
waited 1
for 1
the 1
drink 1
but 1
clever 1
elsie 1

the 1

of 1

and 1
sat 1
down 1

to 1

after 1

fell 1
down 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
likewise 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
elsie 1
we 1
have 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
man 1
upstairs 1
waited 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
wife 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
his 1
thirst 1
grew 1
ever 1
greater 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
myself 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
elsie 1
is 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
sitting 1
together 1
crying 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
reason 1
and 1
that 1
elsies 1
child 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
the 1
elsie 1
might 1
perhaps 1
bring 1
one 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
some 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
killed 1
by 1
the 1
pickaxe 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
sitting 1
beneath 1
it 1
drawing 1
beer 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
time 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
he 1
cried 1
oh 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
elsie 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
likewise 1
wept 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
stayed 1
upstairs 1
alone 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
then 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
he 1
thought 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
below 1
i 1
too 1
must 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
about 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
down 1
the 1
five 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
sitting 1
screaming 1
and 1
lamenting 1
quite 1
piteously 1
each 1
outdoing 1
the 1
other 1
what 1
misfortune 1
has 1
happened 1
then 1
asked 1
he 1
ah 1
dear 1
hans 1
said 1
elsie 1
if 1
we 1
marry 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
big 1
and 1
we 1
perhaps 1
send 1
him 1
here 1
to 1
draw 1
something 1
to 1
drink 1
then 1
the 1
pickaxe 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
left 1
up 1
there 1
might 1
dash 1
his 1
brains 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
fall 1
down 1
so 1
have 1
we 1
not 1
reason 1
to 1
weep 1
come 1
said 1
hans 1
more 1
understanding 1
than 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
needed 1
for 1
my 1
household 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
clever 1
elsie 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
you 1
and 1
seized 1
her 1
hand 1
took 1
her 1
upstairs 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
married 1
her 1
after 1
hans 1
had 1
had 1
her 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
wife 1
i 1

going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
earn 1
some 1
money 1
for 1

into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
corn 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
bread 1
yes 1
dear 1
hans 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
after 1
hans 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
she 1
cooked 1
herself 1
some 1
good 1
broth 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
with 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
field 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1

i 1
cut 1
first 1
or 1
shall 1
i 1
eat 1
first 1
oh 1
i 1
will 1
eat 1
first 1
then 1
she 1
drank 1
her 1
cup 1
of 1
broth 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
fully 1
satisfied 1
she 1
once 1
more 1
said 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
shall 1
i 1
cut 1
first 1
or 1
shall 1
i 1
sleep 1
first 1
i 1
will 1
sleep 1
first 1
then 1
she 1
lay 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
corn 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
hans 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
home 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
elsie 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
elsie 1
i 1
have 1
she 1
is 1
so 1
industrious 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
even 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
when 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
still 1
stayed 1
away 1
hans 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
but 1
nothing 1
was 1
cut 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
lying 1
among 1
the 1
corn 1
asleep 1
then 1
hans 1
hastened 1
home 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
fowlers 1
net 1
with 1
little 1
bells 1
and 1
hung 1
it 1
round 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
still 1
went 1
on 1
sleeping 1
then 1
he 1
ran 1
home 1
shut 1
the 1
housedoor 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
worked 1
at 1
length 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
dark 1
clever 1
elsie 1
awoke 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
jingling 1
all 1
round 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
bells 1
rang 1
at 1
each 1
step 1
which 1
she 1
took 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
alarmed 1
and 1
became 1
uncertain 1
whether 1
she 1
really 1
was 1
clever 1
elsie 1
or 1
not 1
and 1
said 1
is 1
it 1
i 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
i 1
but 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
answer 1
to 1
make 1
to 1
this 1
and 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
doubt 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
thought 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
ask 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
i 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
not 1
i 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
know 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
shut 1
then 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
cried 1
hans 1
is 1
elsie 1
within 1
yes 1
answered 1
hans 1
she 1
is 1
within 1
hereupon 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
said 1
